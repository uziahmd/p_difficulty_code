There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with n players, given that two players can only play against each other if their number of previous games differs by at most one. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem is to determine, for a given n, the maximum possible games the winner could have. Let's think about examples.\n\nFor example, when n=2, there's only one game. The winner plays once. Output is 1.\n\nn=3: The winner can play two games. Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But how does that fit the rule? Let's see. The first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, the next game, the opponent (player 3) has 0 games. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So yes, output is 2.\n\nn=4: The output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's think. If the winner plays three games, that would require that each time they play, the opponent's number of games is within one. Let's see. For example, the first game, opponent has 0 games. Then, after winning, the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays someone who has 1 game. But how would that person have 1 game? That would require that they had already played once. But in a knockout tournament, each game eliminates someone. So for n=4, the structure might be like two initial matches (like 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4), then the winners play. So the winner would have two games. If you tried to make a scenario where the winner plays three games, you'd need to have three rounds. But with four players, the total number of games is 3 (since each game eliminates one, and you need to eliminate 3 players). But how can the winner play three games? Well, the first game, they have 1 game. Then the second game, their opponent has 1 game (so difference is zero). Then third game, their opponent has 2 games. Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think. Maybe the structure is such that the winner plays against someone who has played two games. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that for the winner to play three games, the opponents in each round must have a number of games that's within one of the winner's current count. Let's think recursively. Let's think about the maximum number of games possible for the winner. Let's denote f(n) as the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nFor n=1, it's zero, but that's not part of the input. For n=2, f(2)=1. For n=3, f(3)=2. For n=4, f(4)=2. For n=5, maybe?\n\nLet me think about n=5. How can we arrange the matches so that the winner plays as many games as possible?\n\nLet's think about the structure. The idea is that each time the winner plays, their opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current count, or one less. Because the rule says that the difference between the two players' number of games can't exceed one.\n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, each of their matches must be against an opponent who has played either k-1, k-2, etc. But how to arrange this?\n\nThis feels similar to building a binary tree, where each node represents a game. But perhaps it's more like a Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, they must have played against someone who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). But how does that work?\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays in k games. Then, in the first game, they have 0 games, so the opponent must have 0 games (so that the difference is 0). Then, after that, the winner has 1 game. For the second game, the opponent can have 0 or 1 games. If the opponent has 1 game, then that means that opponent has already played once, which requires that they have won once. So, for the winner to play again, they need to have an opponent that has played once. But how can that happen?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a structure where the winner's path requires that each time they play, the opponent is from a subtree that has a certain number of players. This seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something. Wait, let me think.\n\nLet me consider that to have the winner play k games, the number of players needed is F(k+2), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Let's see:\n\nFor k=1, the winner plays once. So n=2. Which is F(3) = 2. Yes.\n\nFor k=2, the minimal n is 3. Because F(4) is 3. And for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nFor k=3, the minimal n is 5. Because F(5) is 5. Let's see. For example, the winner plays three games. Let's imagine the structure. First, the winner plays against someone (game 1). Then, to play a second game, the opponent must have 1 game. How? That opponent must have played once. So that requires that there was a previous match. So the winner's second game is against someone who has one game. Then, the third game would require the opponent to have 2 games. How?\n\nSo the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is F(k+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. So for example, if the number of players is exactly F(k+2), then the maximum number of games is k.\n\nBut if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number, then we need to find the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤ n. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me test this idea with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,... So for k=2, F(4)=3 ≤4. For k=3, F(5)=5>4. So the maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. For n=10, the sample output is 4. Let's see. Let's compute the Fibonacci numbers up to where F(k+2) ≤10.\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So for k=4, F(6)=8 ≤10. For k=5, F(7)=13>10. So the maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4. So that seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: n=5. Then F(6)=8 is larger than 5. So the maximum k is 3, since F(5)=5. So the answer is 3. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nFor n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes. Let's think of the structure. The first game: winner plays against someone. Then, the second game, the opponent must have 1 game. So that would require that the opponent is from a group that has a certain structure. Let's imagine:\n\nThe winner's path would be:\n\nGame 1: vs A (0 games). Winner has 1 game.\n\nGame 2: vs B (1 game). So B has already played once. So B must have won once. So B's path is a single game. So for that, there's another player C, and B played against C. So that requires that there are 2 players in B's subtree.\n\nThen, for game 3, the opponent must have 2 games. How? Let's see. The opponent must have played two games. So that requires that they have a path of two wins. So for that, there's a subtree that requires 3 players (since F(4)=3). So the total number of players is 1 (winner's initial) + 1 (A) + 2 (B's subtree) + 3 (opponent's subtree) ? No, perhaps the way to model it is that for the winner to have k games, the number of players required is F(k+2). So for k=3, F(5)=5. So n=5 is exactly that. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the approach would be: find the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤n. Then, the answer is k.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=6. The largest F(k+2) is F(6)=8? No, F(5)=5, F(6)=8. So for n=6, the largest is F(5)=5, so k=3. But maybe there's a way to have a higher k?\n\nWait, no. Because for k=3, the minimal n is 5. For n=6, which is larger than 5, but less than 8. So the maximum k is 3. But maybe there's a way to arrange the tournament so that the winner can have more games?\n\nWait, for example, n=6. Let's think. Suppose the winner plays 3 games. But maybe there's a way to have them play 4 games? Let's see.\n\nTo have 4 games, the minimal n is F(6)=8. So for n=6, which is less than 8, it's not possible. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the general approach is to compute the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. So the answer is k.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for a given n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. So how do we compute this?\n\nBut the problem is that n can be up to 1e18. So we need to generate Fibonacci numbers up to that value, and find the maximum k.\n\nSo let's think about generating the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18. Let's see:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the number of terms up to 1e18 is manageable. Let's see:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\n...\n\nEach term is about 1.6 times the previous. So for 1e18, the number of terms is about log_phi(1e18), which is around 80 or so. So generating all the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18 is feasible.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible n (1e18). For each Fibonacci number, store the index. For example, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\n2. For a given n, find the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤n. Then, the answer is k.\n\nWait, for example, n=3. F(4)=3. So k is 2, since k+2=4 → k=2. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example: n=10. The Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. So F(6)=8 ≤10. F(7)=13>10. So k+2=6 → k=4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the problem becomes to find the maximum k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. Then, the answer is m-2.\n\nWait, because for k+2 = m → k = m-2.\n\nSo for example, if F(m) is the largest Fibonacci number <=n, then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut how do we find m?\n\nLet me think. Let's generate the list of Fibonacci numbers, and for each n, find the largest m such that F(m) <=n.\n\nFor example, for n=2, the Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,... So the largest F(m) is 2, which is m=3. Then answer is 3-2=1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Largest F(m) is 3 (m=4). answer 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: largest F(m) is 3 (m=4). answer is 2. Correct.\n\nn=5: F(m)=5 (m=5). answer is 5-2=3. Which would be correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci numbers until the value exceeds 1e18. For each n, find the largest m where F(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=6. The largest F(m) is 5 (m=5). answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to generating the Fibonacci sequence, and for each n, find the maximum m where F(m) ≤n. Then subtract 2.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc.\n\nOnce that list is generated, for a given n, perform a binary search on the list to find the largest value <=n. Then, the answer is the index of that value minus 2.\n\nBut how to generate the list?\n\nLet's think about generating the Fibonacci numbers:\n\nInitialize a list. Start with f1=1, f2=1. Then f3=2, f4=3, etc.\n\nWe can generate them until the next number exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce that list is generated, for each input n, we can perform a binary search on the list to find the largest element <=n.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, for example, we can precompute the list.\n\nLet's generate the list:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nthen while the next number is <= 1e18:\n\nnext_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\nappend to fib.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list will be something like:\n\nLet me compute the first few terms:\n\nfib[1] = 1 (m=1)\n\nfib[2] = 1 (m=2)\n\nfib[3] = 2 (m=3)\n\nfib[4] = 3 (m=4)\n\nfib[5] = 5 (m=5)\n\nfib[6] = 8 (m=6)\n\nfib[7] = 13 (m=7)\n\n...\n\nSo for the code, the list is built as follows.\n\nOnce we have that list, for a given n, find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nWait, but the indexes here. Let's think:\n\nIf the list is stored as a list, say, fib = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...], then the index starts from 0. But in our earlier example, m is the index in the list plus 1? Or not?\n\nWait, for example, the first element is 1 (m=1), the second is 1 (m=2), third is 2 (m=3), etc. So if the list is stored as [f_1, f_2, f_3, ...], then the index i corresponds to m=i+1? No, if the list is stored as [f_1, f_2, f_3, ...], then for the list index i, the m is i+1? Wait, for example, the list starts with [1,1,2,3,5...]. So for the first element (index 0) is m=1, index 1 is m=2, index 2 is m=3, etc. So for a given list element, the m is index +1.\n\nSo for example, when we find that the largest element in the list that is <=n is at index i, then m = i+1. So the answer is m-2 = (i+1) - 2 = i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the list is [f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_k], where f_1=1, f_2=1, f_3=2, etc.\n\nFor a given n, find the maximum f_m such that f_m <=n. Then, the answer is m-2.\n\nSo for example, if f_m is the largest such value, then the answer is m-2.\n\nSo, for example, if n=3, then f_4=3. m=4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo how to find m?\n\nIf the list is [f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_max], then for a given n, we can find the largest m where f_m <=n.\n\nSo in code, for the list, we can do a binary search for n.\n\nSo in Python, we can generate the list of Fibonacci numbers, then for a given n, perform a binary search to find the largest value in the list that is <=n. Once found, the index is i, and m is i+1 (since the list starts with f_1 at index 0). Then the answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nWait, let's take the example where n=3. The list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. The largest value <=3 is 3, which is at index 3. So i=3. m = i+1? No, because the index is 3, which is f_4. So m is 4. So the answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. So m is i+1? Because for the index i, the value is f_{i+1}? Wait, the list is built as:\n\nfib = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...]\n\nfib[0] = f_1 = 1\n\nfib[1] = f_2 = 1\n\nfib[2] = f_3 = 2\n\nfib[3] = f_4 = 3\n\nfib[4] = f_5 = 5\n\nSo the index is i, and the m is i+1. So for the value at index i, m = i+1.\n\nTherefore, once we find the index i where fib[i] is the largest <=n, then m = i+1, and answer is (i+1) - 2 = i-1.\n\nWait, for the example where n=3, the index is 3 (fib[3]=3). Then m=3+1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2. The list is [1,1,2, ...]. The largest value <=2 is 2 at index 2. So m=2+1=3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The largest value <=4 is 3 (fib[3] = 3). So i=3. m=4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code logic is:\n\nprecompute the list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from f_1=1, f_2=1, f_3=2, etc.\n\nfor a given n:\n\nfind the largest element in the list that is <=n. Let's say that element is at index i.\n\nthen answer is (i+1) - 2 = i -1.\n\nBut how to handle cases where n is less than the first Fibonacci number? Well, the input constraints say n >=2. So for n=2, the first element is 1, then 1, then 2. So for n=2, the largest is 2, which is at index 2. So answer is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers as described.\n\nNow, for the input n, perform a binary search on the list to find the largest value <=n.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search?\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For example, using bisect_right.\n\nLet me think. Suppose the list is sorted in increasing order. For example, the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...].\n\nWe can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of n. Then the index is insertion_point -1.\n\nFor example, if n is 3, bisect_right returns 4 (since the list is [1,1,2,3,5,...], and inserting 3 would go after existing 3. So insertion point is 4. So the index is 4-1=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=4. bisect_right finds insertion point at 4 (since 3 <4 <5). So index is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfib_list = [...] # precomputed list of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib_list, n) -1\n\nif index <0: # but n is >=2, so this is not possible.\n\nthen, answer is (index +1) -2 = index -1.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nindex is the index in the list. So the value is fib_list[index] <=n. So m is index+1, answer is m-2 = index +1 -2 = index -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is index -1.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nFor n=2, index is 2 (since fib_list is [1,1,2,3,5...], bisect_right(2) returns 3. So index is 3-1=2. Then answer is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. bisect_right returns 4, index is 3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: index is 3. answer 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: bisect_right returns 4 (since 5 is at index 4, and bisect_right returns insertion point after existing 5). So index is 4-1=3? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,...]. For n=5, bisect_right finds the insertion point after all elements equal to 5. So for the list, the index of 5 is 4. bisect_right returns 5, since the insertion point is after the existing 5. So index is 5-1=4. Then answer is 4-1=3. Which is correct (for n=5, the answer is 3).\n\nYes. So the code is:\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n:\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib_list, n) -1\n\nans = index -1\n\nBut wait, what if the index is 0?\n\nFor example, n=1. But according to the problem statement, n starts from 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut let's check for n=2. The fib_list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. bisect_right(2) returns 3. index is 3-1=2. ans is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the fib_list correctly.\n\nLet's generate it:\n\nStart with a list. Let's initialize it as [1, 1]. Then, generate next numbers as the sum of the last two.\n\nBut we need to generate until the next number exceeds 1e18.\n\nLet me write code for that.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut wait, 1e18 is a float. It's better to use integers. So perhaps:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, this loop will generate all necessary Fibonacci numbers.\n\nOnce this list is generated, for each input n, we can perform the bisect step.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than all elements in the fib list? For example, if n is 1e18 and the last element is less than that. Then, the bisect_right returns len(fib), and index is len(fib)-1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, let's say the last element in fib is F, which is the largest Fibonacci number <= 1e18. Then, for n=1e18, the index is len(fib)-1, and ans is len(fib)-1 -1 = len(fib)-2.\n\nBut let's make sure that the code generates all the required Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me compute some terms.\n\nLet me compute the Fibonacci numbers until they reach 1e18.\n\nLet me think:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nF(9) = 34\n\nF(10) = 55\n\nF(11) = 89\n\nF(12) = 144\n\nF(13) = 233\n\nF(14) = 377\n\nF(15) = 610\n\nF(16) = 987\n\nF(17) = 1597\n\nF(18) = 2584\n\nF(19) = 4181\n\nF(20) = 6765\n\n...\n\nThis grows exponentially. Let me see how many terms there are until it reaches 1e18.\n\nBut for code purposes, it's easy to generate them.\n\nNow, the code for generating the list is straightforward.\n\nOnce that is done, the rest is easy.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The fib list contains 1,1,2,3,5,... So bisect_right(3) returns 4. index is 3. ans is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The fib list has 1,1,2,3,5. bisect_right(4) returns 4 (since 3 <4 <5). index=3. ans=3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: n=10. The fib list up to 8 (F(6)=8, F(7)=13). So bisect_right(10) returns 5 (since 8 <10 <13). index=5-1=4. ans=4-1=3? Wait no. Wait:\n\nWait, the fib list is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...]. For n=10, bisect_right returns the insertion point after 8. So the insertion point is 6 (since the list up to index 5 is 8). So bisect_right returns 6. index is 6-1=5. ans is 5-1=4. Which matches the sample output of 4. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about n=5?\n\nThe fib list has 5 as the 4th element (index 4). So bisect_right returns 5 (since 5 is present in the list). So index is 5-1=4. ans is 4-1=3. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about n=1? Well, the problem states n is at least 2. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input. For example, the input is a string, but in code, we can read it as integer.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nNow, generate the fib list.\n\nBut in code, the code for generating the list:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nWait, but 1e18 is a float. So perhaps better to use 10**18 as integer.\n\nBut in Python, 10**18 is an integer. So:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut for the code, the list may not include the last term. For example, if the next_num is exactly equal to 1e18, then it's added. Otherwise, not.\n\nOnce the list is generated, then for each input n, we do:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) -1\n\nans = index -1\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but what if the index is 0?\n\nFor example, if n=1. But n is >=2. So no.\n\nBut let's check for n=2.\n\nfib list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. bisect_right(2) returns 3. index is 3-1=2. ans=2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1 is not allowed.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 10: output is 4.\n\nSample Input 2: output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about n=1?\n\nBut according to the problem, n is at least 2.\n\nSo code should handle n>=2.\n\nBut what if n=1 is passed? Well, the code would return index -1. For example, if n=1, then bisect_right returns 2 (since the list is [1,1,2, ...], and 1 is found. bisect_right returns 2. index=2-1=1. ans=1-1=0. Which is wrong, but since n is >=2, it's not a problem.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in code, the fib list may not have enough elements. Let me check.\n\nLet me compute the list.\n\nLet me try to generate the list in code.\n\nBut for the code, the list is generated once, and then used for all test cases.\n\nBut in the problem, the code must read from stdin and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n\n    # precompute the fib list\n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n\n    max_n = 10**18\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n        if next_num > max_n:\n\n            break\n\n        fib.append(next_num)\n\n    # now find the index\n\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) -1\n\n    ans = index -1\n\n    print(ans)\n\nBut wait, what if the n is less than the first element of fib? Well, since n >=2, and fib starts with 1, 1, 2, etc. For n=2, it's handled.\n\nBut let's test for n=2:\n\nfib is [1,1,2,3, ...]\n\nbisect_right(fib, 2) returns 3, index is 2. ans is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. fib has 5 as third element (index 4?), let's see:\n\nfib list:\n\nindex 0:1\n\nindex 1:1\n\nindex 2:2\n\nindex 3:3\n\nindex 4:5\n\nso bisect_right(5) returns 5, index=5-1=4. ans=4-1=3. Correct.\n\nBut what about n=6?\n\nfib is [1,1,2,3,5,8,...]\n\nbisect_right(6) returns 5 (since 5 <6 <8). index=5-1=4. ans=4-1=3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly a Fibonacci number?\n\nYes, the code works.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than all elements in the fib list?\n\nFor example, let's say the last element of the fib list is F, and n is larger than F. Then, bisect_right returns len(fib), index is len(fib)-1. ans is (len(fib)-1) -1 = len(fib)-2.\n\nWhich is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's think about that. For example, if n is larger than the largest Fibonacci number in the list, which is F(m). Then, the maximum k is m-2. Because F(m) is the largest Fibonacci number <=n. So the answer is m-2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's check for n=10^18.\n\nBut the code generates the fib list up to the maximum possible number <=1e18. So for that, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nNow, the code may have a problem when n is 1, but according to the problem, n is at least 2.\n\nBut in the code, for n=2, it works.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample input list is ['2', '3', '4', '10'].\n\nFor each of these, the code should output 1, 2, 2, 4.\n\nTesting for n=2:\n\nfib list has 1,1,2,3,5,...\n\nbisect_right returns 3. index=2. ans=1. Correct.\n\nn=3: index=3. ans=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: index=3. ans=2. Correct.\n\nn=10: index is 5 (since fib is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13...], bisect_right(10) returns 6, index=5. ans=5-1=4. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written as a script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script, and the function main() is called.\n\nBut the code may have to generate the fib list each time. However, for n up to 1e18, the loop is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n\n    max_n = 10**18\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n        if next_num > max_n:\n\n            break\n\n        fib.append(next_num)\n\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) - 1\n\n    ans = index - 1\n\n    print(ans)\n\nBut wait, what if the fib list is [1,1], and next_num is 2, which is <=1e18. So the loop appends 2, then 3, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in code, the initial fib list is [1,1], and then the loop adds next_num.\n\nBut what if the next_num is 2, which is added. Then the loop continues.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check for n=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the case when n=1. But the problem says n≥2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the fib list is empty? No, because it starts with [1,1].\n\nBut in code, the loop runs once, adding 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nBut the code is supposed to process a single input line, which is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of previous games between opponents. The solution involves leveraging properties of the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The tournament follows a knockout structure where each game eliminates one player. The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the difference in their number of previous games is at most one. This leads us to consider the Fibonacci sequence, as each player's path to victory can be modeled similarly to how Fibonacci numbers grow.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the number of players, `n`. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games within one of the winner's current count, which aligns with the growth pattern of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$ (the upper limit for `n`). This allows efficient lookup using binary search.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: For a given `n`, use binary search to find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. The position of this Fibonacci number in the sequence gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    max_n = 10**18\n    while True:\n        next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_num > max_n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_num)\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) - 1\n    ans = index - 1\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` representing the number of players.\n\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to $10^{18}$, which is the maximum possible value for `n`. This list is used to quickly determine the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: Using the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, we find the position where `n` would fit in the Fibonacci list. The index found helps determine the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n4. **Calculating Result**: The position of the Fibonacci number in the sequence gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. Adjusting this position by subtracting 2 (as derived from the Fibonacci sequence properties) gives the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using precomputed values and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
