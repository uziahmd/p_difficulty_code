Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during their traversal based on the given rules. And if it's not possible, output -1. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the traversal works for both the rook and the queen. Let me recap the process:\n\nThe figure starts at cell 1. Then, each move, it chooses the smallest-numbered unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This continues until all cells are visited.\n\nSo the key difference between the rook and the queen is their movement patterns. The rook moves in straight lines (same row or column), while the queen can move any direction (like a bishop and rook combined). Therefore, the queen has more possible moves, which might lead to different paths and thus different numbers of teleportations (vuns).\n\nThe goal is to construct a board where the rook's number of vuns is strictly less than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about when this is possible. For example, in the sample input N=4, the rook paid 1 vun and the queen paid 2. So how was that achieved?\n\nLooking at the sample board, perhaps the structure of the numbering forces the queen to have more teleportations. Maybe by arranging the numbers in such a way that the queen's path requires more teleportations compared to the rook's.\n\nBut how do I design such a board? Let's think about the general approach.\n\nFirst, note that for N=1, the answer is -1 because there's only one cell, so no fees are paid by either. For N=2, perhaps there's a way? Let's check.\n\nWait, but the sample shows N=4 is possible. What about N=2?\n\nLet me try to think for small N. Let's take N=2. The total cells are 4.\n\nSuppose the board is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nLet's simulate the rook's path.\n\nStarts at 1 (already visited). From 1, the rook can move to same row (cell 3) or same column (cell 4). The unvisited cells are 3,4,2. The minimal number among them is 2, but wait, can the rook reach 2 from 1? No. Because the rook can only move in same row or column. So from 1 (position (1,1)), the rook can reach (1,2) (cell 3) or (2,1) (cell 4). So the next step is to choose the minimal among 3 and 4. Which is 3. So the rook moves to 3. Then, from there, the unvisited cells are 4 and 2. The rook can move to same row (but only cell 1 is already visited) or same column (cell 2). So the rook can reach 2. So next step is 2. Then, from 2, the unvisited cell is 4. Can the rook reach it? From (2,2), same row is cell (2,1) which is 4. So yes. So rook moves to 4. All cells are visited. So no teleportation. So rook's vuns is 0.\n\nNow for the queen. Starting at 1. From 1, she can reach any cell in same row, column, or diagonal. So unvisited cells are 3,4,2. The minimal is 2. So queen moves to 2. Now, from 2, the unvisited cells are 3 and 4. The queen can reach 3 (same row as 2? Wait, position of 2 is (2,2). Cell 3 is (1,2). So same column. So yes. So queen can move to 3. Then from 3, unvisited is 4. From (1,2), can she reach (2,1)? Yes, because it's a diagonal. So queen moves to 4. All done. No teleportations. So queen also has 0 vuns. So this arrangement doesn't work. So for N=2, maybe there's no possible arrangement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another arrangement. Let me think. Suppose the board is:\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nRook starts at 1. Next possible moves are same row (cell 2) or same column (cell 3). Minimal is 2. So rook moves to 2. Then, from 2, can move to same row (already visited) or same column (cell 4). So moves to 4. Then from 4, same row (cell 3) is un",
