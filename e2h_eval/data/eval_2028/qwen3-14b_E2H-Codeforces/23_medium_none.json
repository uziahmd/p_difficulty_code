In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nThe initial step is to check whether the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If they do, return 0. Otherwise, figure out what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form one.\n\nSo, first, check if there's a triplet or sequence in the existing three tiles. If yes, output 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal steps to reach a state where a triplet or sequence exists.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can form a triplet by adding one tile. For example, if two of them are same, then adding one more would make a triplet. So, for example, if the input is [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding another 1m would make a triplet. But wait, the original three tiles don't form a triplet, but adding one tile would. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nCase 2: The three tiles can form a sequence with adding one tile. For example, if the tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding a 3m would make a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a scenario where you need to add two tiles. Like, if the three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then you can't form a sequence with adding one tile. But maybe adding two tiles to form a triplet. Or perhaps adding one tile to form a triplet. Wait, no. For example, if you have two 1m and one 2m. Then adding another 1m would make triplet. So that's one tile. But if you have 1m, 3m, 5m, then you can't form a triplet unless you add two more tiles. But maybe there's a way to form a sequence by adding two tiles. Like, adding 2m and 4m to form 1-2-3 or 3-4-5? No, because you need three consecutive numbers. So for example, if you have 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding 2m and 4m would allow you to form sequences like 1-2-3 or 3-4-5. But that requires adding two tiles. So in that case, the answer would be 2. But maybe there's a better way?\n\nWait, but the problem says that after drawing tiles, she can have any number of tiles. So the total number of tiles after drawing is 3 + k, where k is the number of drawn tiles. But to form a mentsu, she needs to have at least one mentsu. So the question is, what is the minimal k such that there exists a subset of 3 tiles in her hand (original plus drawn) that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo the problem is not about forming a mentsu with all the tiles, but having at least one mentsu in the entire collection.\n\nSo for example, if the original three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m, then adding a 3m would allow a sequence (1,2,3). So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. To form a sequence, you need to add two tiles. For example, add 2m and 3m (but that's two tiles), then you have 1,2,3 and 3,4,5? No, but maybe adding 2m and 4m. Then you have 1,2,3 (if you have 2m and 3m?), but original tiles are 1m,3m,5m. Adding 2m and 4m gives you 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m. Then there are multiple sequences. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a triplet. For example, if you have 1m, 3m, 5m. To form a triplet, you need to add two more of the same tile. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So that's a triplet. So that would require adding two tiles. So the minimal between 2 (for triplet) and 2 (for sequence) is 2.\n\nSo in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nBut perhaps there are other possibilities. So the approach is to consider all possible ways to form a triplet or a sequence, and find the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that.\n\nSo the steps for solving this problem:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a mentsu.\n\nNow, how to check for possible mentsu possibilities after adding tiles.\n\nLet me think of all possible scenarios.\n\nFor the triplet case:\n\nWe need three of the same tile. So, for each tile in the original three, count how many there are. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. If there's only one, then adding two more. So the minimal steps for triplet would be based on the maximum count of any tile in the original three.\n\nWait, but the original three may have multiple counts. For example, if the original has two 1m and one 2m. Then, to form a triplet, we can add one more 1m. So the minimal steps for triplet is 1. But if the original has one 1m, one 2m, one 3m, then to form a triplet, you need to add two of any tile. So the minimal steps for triplet is 2.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility, the minimal steps required is 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the original three. For example, if original has two same tiles, then 3 - 2 = 1. So that's the steps needed to form a triplet.\n\nBut wait, this is only considering the existing counts. However, when you add tiles, you can choose to add more of the same tile. So, for example, if the original has two 1m, then adding one 1m makes a triplet. So that's 1 step.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if the original has one 1m, one 1p, one 1s. Then, the max count is 1. So to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of the same type. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So steps is 2. Alternatively, adding two 1p's. So steps is 2. So the minimal steps for triplet is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for triplet is 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the original three. So that's one possible way to calculate the steps required to form a triplet.\n\nBut for the triplet, the minimal steps would be 3 - max_count. However, this is only if you want to form a triplet. So, for example, if the original has 1m, 1m, 1m, then the steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's one part of the problem. Now, for the sequence case.\n\nFor sequences, it's more complicated. Because sequences are three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, 1m, 2m, 3m is a sequence. So, given the original three tiles, how can we find the minimal steps to get a sequence?\n\nLet me think: For the original three tiles, we can look for possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles. For example, if the original has 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding a 3m gives a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: original has 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, adding 2m and 4m would allow a sequence (1-2-3, or 3-4-5). So steps is 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to form a sequence with fewer steps. For example, if the original is 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m gives a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nBut how do I compute the minimal steps required to form a sequence?\n\nFirst, we need to group the original tiles by their suit. Because sequences can only be formed within the same suit.\n\nSo, for each suit (m, p, s), collect the numbers present in the original three tiles. Then, for each suit, check if there's a way to form a sequence by adding some tiles.\n\nSo, for example, suppose in the original three tiles, there are two suits. For example, two tiles in m and one in p. Then, for the m suit, check if there's a possible sequence. For the p suit, check if there's a possible sequence. The minimal steps for the sequence would be the minimal steps among all suits.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each suit in the original tiles:\n\n   collect all the numbers in that suit.\n\n   then, find the minimal steps needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nThen, take the minimal steps over all suits.\n\nSo, the problem becomes, for a given list of numbers (say, for a particular suit), what is the minimal number of tiles to add to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the example. Suppose the numbers in a suit are [1, 2, 4]. How can we form a sequence?\n\nWe need three consecutive numbers. The existing numbers are 1, 2, 4. So, possible sequences could be 1-2-3 (need to add 3), or 2-3-4 (need to add 3), or 3-4-5 (add 3 and 5). So the minimal steps here is 1 (adding 3).\n\nAnother example: numbers are [1, 3, 5]. What's the minimal steps?\n\nPossible options:\n\n- Add 2 and 3 to get 1-2-3 (needs 2 steps) or 3-4-5 (needs add 4 and 5, 2 steps) or add 2 and 4 to get 3-4-5 (needs 2 steps) or 2-3-4 (needs 2 steps). So the minimal steps is 2.\n\nAnother example: numbers are [1, 2, 3]. Then, no steps needed. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: numbers are [1, 2, 5]. Then, possible sequences could be 1-2-3 (add 3), 2-3-4 (add 3 and 4), or 5-6-7 (add 6 and 7). So minimal steps is 1.\n\nBut how to compute this programmatically?\n\nFor a given list of numbers (say, a list of numbers in a suit, possibly with duplicates?), but since the original three tiles can have duplicates, but in the same suit. For example, if the original is [1m, 1m, 2m], then the numbers are [1,1,2]. How to process that?\n\nWait, but for sequences, the three numbers must be consecutive and distinct. So, for example, [1,1,2] can't form a sequence. So, for sequences, the numbers must be three different consecutive numbers. So, even if there are duplicates, the sequence requires three distinct numbers. Therefore, when considering the numbers in a suit, we need to look for possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, and see what's the minimal steps to get them.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can collect the unique numbers present. Let's say the unique numbers are sorted.\n\nFor example, if the original numbers are [1, 1, 2], then the unique numbers are [1,2]. So, the possible sequences that can be formed with adding some numbers.\n\nSo, for the unique numbers in the suit, we can check for possible sequences that can be formed with adding some numbers.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the numbers in the suit, sorted as a list. For example, [1,2,4].\n\nWe can check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers. For each possible sequence, compute how many numbers are missing from the original numbers.\n\nFor example, for the possible sequence [1,2,3], the original has 1 and 2, so missing 1 number (3). So steps needed is 1.\n\nFor the possible sequence [2,3,4], original has 2 and 4. Missing 3. Steps needed 1.\n\nFor the possible sequence [3,4,5], original has 4. Missing 3 and 5. Steps needed 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers (like x, x+1, x+2), check if the original numbers in the suit contain at least one of each of these numbers. Then, the number of missing numbers is the steps needed. The minimal steps across all possible sequences is the minimal steps for this suit.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible sequences that could be formed with the existing numbers?\n\nAlternatively, for the existing numbers in the suit, we can generate all possible ranges that can be extended to a sequence.\n\nBut perhaps the better approach is to generate all possible sequences that could be formed by adding some tiles, and for each possible sequence, compute the number of tiles needed to complete it.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nFor example, in the case of numbers [1,2,4], the possible sequences that can be formed are:\n\n[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5], [1,2,3], etc. But the maximum possible x is 7 (since the numbers are up to 9). So for each possible x in 1..7, check if the sequence x, x+1, x+2 can be formed with the existing numbers, and compute the steps needed.\n\nSo for each suit, the steps for forming a sequence is the minimal steps needed to complete any of these possible sequences.\n\nSo, for each possible x in 1..7:\n\n   required_numbers = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n   existing_numbers = set of numbers in the suit\n\n   missing = required_numbers - existing_numbers\n\n   steps_needed = len(missing)\n\n   keep track of the minimal steps_needed.\n\nBut also, the existing_numbers may have more than one of the required numbers. For example, if the existing_numbers has x and x+1, but not x+2, then steps_needed is 1. So this approach works.\n\nBut then, for each suit, we can compute the minimal steps for forming a sequence.\n\nOnce we have that, the minimal steps for the sequence is the minimal steps across all suits.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nCheck if the current tiles already have a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal steps between the triplet steps and the sequence steps.\n\nBut how to check if the current tiles already have a mentsu?\n\nSo, for the initial three tiles, check if they form a triplet (all three same) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit).\n\nSo, first, check for triplet: if all three are same tile.\n\nIf not, check for sequence: all three in same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nFor example, 1m, 2m, 3m is a sequence. 3m, 2m, 1m is also a sequence.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check for triplet\n\n    if tiles[0][0] == tiles[1][0] and tiles[0][0] == tiles[2][0] and tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[0][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check for sequence\n\n    # check if all same suit\n\n    if tiles[0][1] != tiles[1][1] or tiles[0][1] != tiles[2][1]:\n\n        return False\n\n    # get numbers as integers\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    if nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the numbers may not be sorted. So, for example, if the tiles are 3m, 1m, 2m. Then sorted numbers are 1,2,3. So the difference between first and last is 2. So the condition is that the three numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo the code for checking the sequence would be:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\nif sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] == 2 and sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1 and sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[1] == 1:\n\n   return True\n\nBut that's equivalent to checking that the three numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, 1,2,3 → yes. 2,3,4 → yes. 1,3,5 → no. 1,1,2 → sorted_nums is [1,1,2], then sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] is 1, which is not 2. So returns false.\n\nSo this code would correctly check for sequences.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case where the initial three tiles do not form a mentsu, compute the minimal steps between the triplet steps and the sequence steps.\n\nSo, for the triplet steps: as discussed earlier, it's 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the original three.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the original has two same tiles. Then, adding one more would make a triplet. So steps is 1. But if there are two different tiles, each with count 2? Wait, no, original has three tiles. So possible counts are:\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are [a, a, b], then max_count is 2. So steps needed is 1.\n\nIf the three are [a, b, c], then max_count is 1. So steps needed is 3 - 1 = 2. So adding two more of same tile.\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for the triplet steps, compute 3 - max_count.\n\nFor the sequence steps, for each suit, compute the minimal steps required to form a sequence in that suit, and take the minimal over all suits.\n\nSo, for each suit in the original three tiles, collect the numbers present. Then, for that suit, generate all possible sequences (x, x+1, x+2) and compute the steps needed to form them.\n\nBut how to collect the numbers per suit.\n\nFor example, original tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3p'].\n\nThen, for suit 's', numbers are [1,2]. For suit 'p', numbers are [3].\n\nSo, for each suit, we process the numbers.\n\nNow, for each suit, the minimal steps for sequence is the minimal steps needed to form any sequence in that suit.\n\nSo, for example, if a suit has numbers [1,2], then possible sequences are [1,2,3] (needs 1 step) or [2,3,4] (needs 2 steps). So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences for a given set of numbers in a suit.\n\nSo, for the suit's numbers, let's say we have a sorted list of unique numbers. For example, [1,2,4].\n\nWe can generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers that could be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how to find all possible sequences that can be completed with the existing numbers.\n\nSo, for the numbers in the suit, the possible x can be from 1 to 7 (since 7+2=9). For each x in 1..7, check if the existing numbers have at least one of x, x+1, x+2. Then, the steps needed is the number of missing numbers in that trio.\n\nBut even if the existing numbers have some of the required numbers, but not all, then steps needed is the count of missing ones.\n\nSo, for example, for x=1, the required numbers are 1,2,3. Existing numbers are 1 and 2. Missing 3. Steps is 1.\n\nFor x=2, required numbers 2,3,4. Existing has 2 and 4. Missing 3. Steps is 1.\n\nFor x=3: required 3,4,5. Existing has 4. Missing 3 and 5. Steps 2.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nSo, the code for the sequence steps would be:\n\ndef min_sequence_steps(suit_numbers):\n\n    # suit_numbers is a list of numbers (integers) in the suit\n\n    # find the minimal steps to form a sequence\n\n    unique_numbers = sorted(list(set(suit_numbers)))\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n\n    # iterate all possible x from 1 to 7\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):\n\n        required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n        existing = set(unique_numbers)\n\n        missing = required - existing\n\n        steps = len(missing)\n\n        if steps < min_steps:\n\n            min_steps = steps\n\n    return min_steps\n\nWait, but what if there are no possible sequences? For example, if the suit has only one number. Then, for all possible x, the required numbers would need to include that number. But for example, if the suit has only 9. Then, possible sequences are 7,8,9 (steps 2: need 7 and 8), 8,9,10 (but 10 is invalid, so x can't be 8. Since x can be up to 7, so x=7 gives 7,8,9. So steps is 2. Similarly for other possibilities.\n\nSo, the code will generate all possibilities.\n\nBut for the case where the suit has only one number, the minimal steps would be 2 (for example, adding two numbers to form a sequence).\n\nSo, for each suit, the code returns the minimal steps required to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nOnce we have that, the minimal steps for the sequence is the minimal among all suits.\n\nSo, the overall steps for the problem are:\n\nFor the given three tiles:\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the triplet_steps (3 - max_count).\n\nCompute the sequence_steps (the minimal steps over all suits).\n\nThe answer is the minimum between triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple suits? For example, the original three tiles are in two different suits. For the sequence_steps, we need to check each suit and take the minimal steps for that suit. For example, if one suit has a minimal steps of 1, and another has 2, then the sequence_steps is 1.\n\nSo, the code would collect all suits present in the original three tiles, for each of them compute the minimal steps for sequence, and take the minimal among those.\n\nBut what if a suit has no numbers? Well, no, because the original three tiles are in some suits. For example, if all three are in m, then the other suits are not considered.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\nCollect all suits present in the original three tiles. For each suit, collect the numbers in that suit.\n\nFor example, original tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3p']. Then, the suits are 's' and 'p'.\n\nFor suit 's', numbers are [1,2]. For suit 'p', numbers are [3].\n\nThen, for each of these suits, compute the minimal steps for sequence.\n\nSo, for suit 's', the minimal steps is 1 (as discussed earlier). For suit 'p', the minimal steps is 2 (for example, x=1: required 1,2,3. existing has 3. missing 1 and 2 → steps 2; x=2: required 2,3,4 → existing has 3, missing 2 and 4 → steps 2; x=3: required 3,4,5 → missing 4,5 → steps 2. So the minimal steps for suit 'p' is 2. So the overall sequence_steps is min(1, 2) = 1.\n\nThus, the answer would be min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nOriginal tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu: no. Because they are in two suits, and none are triplets.\n\nCheck triplet steps: count the occurrences of each tile.\n\nThe three tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. So counts are:\n\n3p: 1\n\n9m: 1\n\n2p: 1.\n\nmax_count is 1. triplet_steps is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSequence steps: check for each suit.\n\nSuit 'p' has numbers [3, 2]. Suit 'm' has [9].\n\nFor suit 'p':\n\nunique_numbers = [2,3]. So possible sequences:\n\nx=1: required 1,2,3 → existing has 2 and 3. missing 1 → steps 1.\n\nx=2: required 2,3,4 → existing has 2 and 3. missing 4 → steps 1.\n\nx=3: required 3,4,5 → missing 4 and 5 → steps 2.\n\nso the minimal steps for suit 'p' is 1.\n\nFor suit 'm': numbers [9]. possible sequences:\n\nx=7 → 7,8,9 → missing 7 and 8 → steps 2.\n\nx=8 → 8,9,10 → invalid (since 10 is not allowed). So x can be up to 7.\n\nSo the minimal steps for suit 'm' is 2.\n\nThus, the sequence_steps is min(1, 2) → 1.\n\nThus, the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother sample input: '9m 9m 9m' → already triplet. So output is 0.\n\nAnother sample input: '1s 2s 3s' → already sequence. Output 0.\n\nSo, the code would handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the original three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Check if they form a mentsu? No. Because triplet requires three same. Here, two 1m and one 2m. Not a triplet. Sequence? They are in same suit. sorted numbers are [1,1,2]. The sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] is 1, which is not equal to 2. So no sequence.\n\nSo, triplet_steps is 3 - 2 = 1. For sequence steps:\n\nsuit 'm' has numbers [1, 1, 2]. unique numbers [1,2]. So for possible sequences:\n\nx=1: required 1,2,3. existing has 1 and 2 → missing 3 → steps 1.\n\nx=2: required 2,3,4. existing has 2 → missing 3 and 4 → steps 2.\n\nso minimal steps is 1. So overall answer is min(1, 1) → 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nBut if you add 3m, you can form a sequence. So yes.\n\nAnother case: original is [1m, 3m, 5m]. triplet steps is 3 - 1 = 2. sequence steps:\n\nfor suit m, numbers [1,3,5]. unique numbers [1,3,5].\n\npossible x:\n\nx=1: required 1,2,3 → missing 2 → steps 1.\n\nx=2: required 2,3,4 → missing 2 and 4 → steps 2.\n\nx=3: required 3,4,5 → missing 4 → steps 1.\n\nx=4: required 4,5,6 → missing 4 and 6 → steps 2.\n\nx=5: required 5,6,7 → missing 6 and 7 → steps 2.\n\nso the minimal steps is 1 (either x=1 or x=3). So the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. So adding one tile (either 2m or 4m) to form a sequence.\n\nWait, but in this case, adding one tile would allow a sequence. For example, adding 2m gives 1,2,3. Or adding 4m gives 3,4,5. So the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to our code, the sequence steps would be 1, so the answer is min(2, 1) → 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the triplet_steps.\n\nCompute the sequence_steps.\n\nThe answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, parsing the input. The input is three strings, e.g., the first example input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but wait, the input is a single line with three strings. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input description says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nWait, the input is three strings separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Wait, the actual input is a single line with three strings. For example, the first example input is \"1s 2s 3s\" (but that's three tiles, but the input is three strings. Wait, no. Wait, the input is three strings. For example, if the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", that's three strings? No, that's one string with three tiles. Wait, no, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit...\n\nAh, no! Wait, the input is three strings. Each string represents a tile. So, for example, the input for the first example is three strings: '1s', '2s', '3s'. But the sample input shows ['1s 2s 3s', ...], which seems to be a mistake. Looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut this seems to be a list of three test cases, each being a line. But the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, the input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces. For example, the first example input is three strings: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\nBut in the sample input given, it's written as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], which seems to be a list of three test cases, each being a line. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting.\n\nBut regardless, the code should read three strings from input. For example, in Python, the input is read as input().split(), which splits the line into three elements.\n\nSo, for example, if the input line is \"1s 2s 3s\", then the code would split into [\"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"].\n\nSo, the code should read the three tiles as a list.\n\nOnce the tiles are parsed, the code proceeds to check for mentsu.\n\nNow, implementing the check for mentsu.\n\nThen, if not, compute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nif len(tiles) != 3:\n\n    # but according to problem statement, input is three strings.\n\nBut assuming that the input is correct.\n\nThen, check for mentsu:\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # all same suit?\n\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n\n    for t in tiles:\n\n        if t[1] != suit:\n\n            return False\n\n    # same suit, check numbers\n\n    nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n\n    if nums_sorted[2] - nums_sorted[0] == 2 and nums_sorted[1] - nums_sorted[0] == 1 and nums_sorted[2] - nums_sorted[1] == 1:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the triplet check is not sufficient. Because the triplet requires three identical tiles. So, for example, tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]. But for that, the code checks if all three are equal.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 1m → returns True.\n\nSo, that code is correct.\n\nOnce that's done, if has_mentsu returns True, output 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nFor triplet_steps:\n\ncount the frequency of each tile. For example, using a dictionary.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\n\ntriplet_steps = 3 - max_count\n\nBut for example, if the tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], the max_count is 2 → triplet_steps is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nFor sequence_steps:\n\nWe need to group the numbers by suit.\n\nsuits_dict = {}\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    number = int(t[0])\n\n    if suit not in suits_dict:\n\n        suits_dict[suit] = []\n\n    suits_dict[suit].append(number)\n\nThen, for each suit in suits_dict:\n\ncompute the minimal steps for that suit.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef compute_min_sequence_steps(numbers_list):\n\n    # numbers_list is a list of numbers (could have duplicates)\n\n    unique_numbers = sorted(list(set(numbers_list)))\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be from 1 to 7 (since x+2 can be up to 9)\n\n        required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n        existing = set(unique_numbers)\n\n        missing = required - existing\n\n        steps = len(missing)\n\n        if steps < min_steps:\n\n            min_steps = steps\n\n    return min_steps\n\nThen, for each suit in suits_dict:\n\ncurrent_steps = compute_min_sequence_steps(suits_dict[suit])\n\nkeep track of the minimal steps across all suits.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nsequence_steps = float('inf')\n\nfor suit, numbers in suits_dict.items():\n\n    current_steps = compute_min_sequence_steps(numbers)\n\n    if current_steps < sequence_steps:\n\n        sequence_steps = current_steps\n\nSo, the overall answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut what if there are no suits? Well, the input is three tiles, so there must be at least one suit.\n\nThus, the code would proceed.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nSample input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\ntiles = ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nhas_mentsu? Check triplet: all three are different. Check sequence: suits are p, m, p. So not same suit. So returns False.\n\ntriplet_steps: counts",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand.
