Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. Two colors are compatible if either both are specific and the same, or one is a question mark (which can match any color). So, for example, a '?' on the left can pair with any right boot, and vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm. The straightforward way would be to try to pair as many as possible. But how?\n\nAn initial idea: For each left boot and right boot, check if they are compatible. But with n up to 150,000, that's O(n²) which is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about grouping the boots by their colors. Let's consider the left boots and right boots separately.\n\nFor specific colors (non-?), we can try to pair them with matching specific colors. But also, the ? can be used as wildcards.\n\nBut how to optimally use the ?s? Because if we have a left ? and a right ?, pairing them uses two wildcards, but maybe there's a better way. Or if a left ? can be paired with a specific color, which might save the other ? for another pair.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Count the number of specific colors on the left and right. For example, for each color c (a-z), count how many left boots have c, and how many right boots have c.\n\n2. For each color c, the maximum number of pairs between left c and right c is the minimum of the counts. So, for example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we can make 3 pairs. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\n3. Then, handle the question marks. The remaining left ? and right ? can be paired with each other. Also, the remaining left ? can be paired with the remaining right specific colors (but those specific colors have already been matched as much as possible). Similarly for the right ?.\n\nWait, but maybe we need to first pair the specific colors, then use the ?s to fill in the gaps. Let me think again.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n- First, process all specific colors (non-?) on both sides. For each color c, pair as many left c with right c as possible. This gives us some pairs.\n\n- Then, collect all remaining left ? and right ?. Also, collect any leftover specific colors (but that's probably not useful anymore). Wait, no. Once we've paired all specific colors, there might be some left over specific colors. But since they can't be paired with anything else except ?s. For example, if there's a left 'a' that wasn't paired with a right 'a', but there's a right '?', then we can pair that left 'a' with the right '?'.\n\nSo perhaps after pairing the same colors, we need to use the ?s to pair with the remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Create frequency dictionaries for left and right boots, excluding the question marks. For example, left_counts[c] = number of left boots with color c (excluding ?), and similarly for right_counts.\n\n2. For each color c in left_counts and right_counts, take min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) and add that to the total pairs. Then subtract that from both left_counts and right_counts. This way, we've paired as many same-colored specific boots as possible.\n\n3. Now, collect the remaining left question marks (left_q) and right question marks (right_q). Also, collect any remaining specific colors on left and right.\n\nBut wait, after step 2, the left_counts and right_counts may have some entries. For example, if there were more left 'a's than right 'a's, then after step 2, left_counts['a'] would have some remaining. But these can't be paired with any specific color (since the right has none left), but can be paired with right ?s. Similarly, the right_counts may have some colors left that can be paired with left ?s.\n\nSo, after step 2, the remaining left and right specific colors can be paired with ?s. So, the next step is:\n\n4. For the remaining left specific colors (summing up all left_counts[c] for c in left_counts) and remaining right specific colors (summing up right_counts[c] for c in right_counts), we can pair them with ?s. However, we need to consider that each ? can be used once.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs that can be formed",
