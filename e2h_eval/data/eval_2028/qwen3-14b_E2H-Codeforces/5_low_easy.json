Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark is compatible with any color. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and right boot with compatible colors. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum k followed by k pairs of indices (1-based). If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to pair the boots optimally. Let's think about the possible strategies.\n\nThe key idea here is that we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs. Let's think about two cases:\n\n1. Pairing specific colors (non-?) with matching colors.\n2. Using the ? as wildcards to fill in gaps.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider that for each left boot and right boot, if they are compatible, we can pair them. But since each can be used once, we need to find a way to pair them optimally.\n\nAn efficient way might be to first pair the non-question marks that match exactly. Then use the question marks to pair with remaining boots.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots that have the same specific color (not ?). For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', pair them. But how to do this optimally? Because if we pair them directly, that uses up both, but maybe there's a better way when considering other possibilities.\n\nWait, but for maximum pairs, perhaps it's best to first pair all possible exact matches, then use the ?s.\n\nBut maybe not. Because for example, if there are more left ? than right ?, but some specific colors can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nWe can process the pairs in two stages:\n\nStage 1: Match all left and right boots that have the same specific color (non-?).\n\nStage 2: Match the remaining boots using the ?s. For example, left ? can pair with any right boot that hasn't been paired yet, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut how to track which boots have already been used?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can create two arrays (or sets) for left and right boots that are not yet paired.\n\nWe can first iterate through each left boot and right boot, and pair those with the same color. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, we can count the frequencies of each color on the left and right. For example, for each color c (excluding ?), the number of pairs possible is min(count_left[c], count_right[c]). But this would be the case if we pair all same-color boots. However, this is not directly applicable because each boot is unique (they are in positions). So, for example, if there are multiple left 'a's and multiple right 'a's, we can pair them in any way, but each pair must consist of one left and one right.\n\nSo, the first step is to pair as many same-color (non-?) boots as possible.\n\nOnce that's done, we can handle the ?s. The remaining left ?s can be paired with remaining right boots (including ?s). Similarly, remaining right ?s can be paired with remaining left boots.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available for pairing?\n\nMaybe the way to proceed is:\n\n1. Create two lists: left_available and right_available. Initially, all boots are available.\n\n2. For each color c (not ?), find all left boots with color c and right boots with color c. Pair them as much as possible.\n\n3. Then, pair the remaining left ?s with remaining right boots (any that are not yet paired), and similarly for remaining right ?s.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to first pair the same colors, then pair the ?s.\n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\nLet me think of the problem as a bipartite graph, where each left node is connected to right nodes that are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching. However, for n up to 150000, standard maximum bipartition matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp) are O(E√V), which would be too slow here. So we need a greedy approach that gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nSo, the problem requires a greedy approach that can be implemented in linear time.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\nFirst, process all pairs where left and right have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not ?), pair as many left and right boots with that color as possible",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the \"Colored Boots\" problem, we aim to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color (lowercase letter) or an indefinite color represented by `'?'`.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\nWe approach the problem in two main phases:\n\n1. **Exact Color Matching**: We first pair all left and right boots with the same specific color (excluding `'?'`). This is straightforward because only matching colors are compatible.\n\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling exact matches, we pair remaining `'?'` (indefinite) boots with any unpaired boot. Since `'?'` can match with any color, this step ensures that we maximize the use of these flexible boots.\n\nWe track which boots have already been used using boolean arrays. For efficiency, we iterate through each position once for pairing exact matches and then handle the wildcards.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We maintain two arrays: `used_left` and `used_right`, to mark which boots have already been paired.\n- We use dictionaries to count the number of available left and right boots for each color (excluding `'?'`).\n- We iterate over all left and right boots, and for each color, we match them as long as both are available.\n- Finally, we process the remaining `'?'` on both sides to form additional pairs.\n\n---\n\n### **Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = data[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = data[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match non-? colors\n    color_count_left = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    color_count_right = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            color_count_left[l[i]] += 1\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            color_count_right[r[i]] += 1\n\n    # Create mappings for colors\n    color_to_indices_left = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    color_to_indices_right = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            color_to_indices_left[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            color_to_indices_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Try to match exact colors\n    for c in color_to_indices_left:\n        if c in color_to_indices_right:\n            left_list = color_to_indices_left[c]\n            right_list = color_to_indices_right[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    used_left[left_idx] = True\n                    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Match ? with unpaired boots\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]:\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Pair remaining ? with unpaired boots\n    for i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n        l_idx = left_q[i]\n        r_idx = right_q[i]\n        pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n        used_left[l_idx] = True\n        used_right[r_idx] = True\n\n    # Now, pair remaining ? from left with unpaired right boots (not ?)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]:\n            for j in range(n):\n                if r[j] != '?' and not used_right[j]:\n                    pairs.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    # Now, pair remaining ? from right with unpaired left boots (not ?)\n    for j in range(n):\n        if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]:\n            for i in range(n):\n                if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]:\n                    pairs.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Parts**\n\n- **Color Counting**: We use `collections.defaultdict` to count the number of each color in both left and right boots, excluding `'?'`.\n- **Index Mapping**: We store indices of each color in separate lists for efficient matching.\n- **Greedy Matching**: We greedily match left and right boots of the same color first, then use `'?'` to match any remaining unpaired boots.\n- **Final Pairing**: After processing exact matches, we match remaining `'?'` with any unpaired boots, ensuring all possible pairs are formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently within acceptable time complexity for large inputs.",
