He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2, the count is just the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The formula for the exponent of 5 in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are asked: given m (the required number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n are there such that Z(n) = m?\n\n But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, it does not increase by one every time. For example, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... until Z(9)=1, then Z(10)=2.\n\n So, for a fixed m, we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that sometimes the same m might not appear? Actually, the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". But observe:\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then f(n) is non-decreasing and jumps at multiples of 5, 25, etc.\n\n   For example, when m=0, then n can be from 1 to 4.\n   When m=1, then n from 5 to 9.\n   When m=2, then n from 10 to 14.\n\n But wait, what about m=5? \n   We know that 25 contributes two zeros. So:\n      Z(24) = 4 (since 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4)\n      Z(25) = 6 (because 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6)\n\n   So between 20 and 24: \n        n=20: 4, n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, then n=25:6.\n\n   Therefore, there is no n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n   Similarly, m=6 first appears at n=25.\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (let's call this low_bound).\n         But actually, we want the range [L, R] such that Z(L) = Z(L+1) = ... = Z(R) = m.\n\n However, note: we must also check if m is achievable. Sometimes there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   But note: we want the first n where Z(n) >= m, but then we must check that at that n, Z(n) is exactly m? Not necessarily.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let left = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Then, we can compute the next jump: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n that have exactly m zeros are those n from the lower bound (left) to one less than the start of the next jump (which is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1).\n\n   However, if there is no n such that Z(n) >= m+1, then the upper bound is the last n for which Z(n)=m.\n\n   But wait: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and goes to infinity as n increases. So we can always find an n such that Z(n) >= m+1 (unless m is very large, but note m>=1 and up to 100000).\n\n   However, note: if m is so large that even the maximum n we consider (like n=10^6 or more) doesn't have Z(n) >= m+1, then we should set the upper bound appropriately.\n\n   But the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   How to compute the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m?\n\n   We can use binary search. The smallest n such that Z(n) >= m is the lower bound for our range.\n\n   Then, we need the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Let that be next_n.\n\n   Then, the numbers with exactly m zeros are the integers from the first n (with Z(n)=m) to next_n-1.\n\n   However, note: what if the smallest n with Z(n)>=m already has Z(n)=m? Then the range is [n, next_n-1].\n\n   But what if the smallest n with Z(n)>=m has Z(n)>m? Then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n   Example: m=5. \n        We want the smallest n such that Z(n)>=5. \n        We know Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 -> so the smallest n is 25. But Z(25)=6 which is >5. Then the set of n with Z(n)=5 is empty.\n\n   So the steps:\n\n   1. Use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Call this L.\n   2. Check if Z(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n   Alternatively, we can:\n\n   - Find L = smallest n with Z(n) >= m.\n   - Find R = smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n that have exactly m zeros are the integers from L to R-1.\n\n   Why? Because Z(n) is constant on intervals and jumps at certain points. The jump from m to m+1 happens at R. So for all n in [L, R-1], Z(n) is at least m (by definition of L) and less than m+1 (because at R we get m+1). But note: we require exactly m.\n\n   However, what if Z(L) is greater than m? Then we would have skipped m. In fact, the condition for having zeros exactly m is that the entire interval [L, R-1] has Z(n)=m? \n\n   Let me test with m=5:\n\n        L = smallest n with Z(n)>=5 -> 25 (since Z(25)=6>=5)\n        R = smallest n with Z(n)>=6 -> 25 (since Z(25)=6>=6)\n\n        Then the interval is [25, 24] -> empty.\n\n   But wait, that's correct because there is no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n   Now, for m=1:\n\n        L = smallest n with Z(n)>=1 -> 5 (Z(5)=1)\n        R = smallest n with Z(n)>=2 -> 10 (Z(10)=2)\n\n        Then the interval is [5,9]. And indeed, n=5 to 9: Z(n)=1.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Define a function Z(n) that computes the exponent of 5 in n!.\n\n   Step 2: Use binary search to find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m. (low_bound)\n   Step 3: Use binary search to find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m+1. (high_bound)\n\n   Step 4: Then the numbers n with exactly m zeros are the integers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n   But note: the problem says to output:\n        First, print k (the number of values) and then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n   However, if there are no such n, then k=0 and we output nothing else (just 0).\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   However, the input constraint is m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", and n can be any positive integer. But note that for very large m, we might not be able to find an n? Actually, we can always find an n for any m because Z(n) grows without bound. But we are only asked for m up to 100000.\n\n   How to compute Z(n) quickly? Note that n can be as large as ... well, we are doing binary search for n. The value of n for which Z(n) >= 100000 might be large.\n\n   We need to set an upper bound for the binary search.\n\n   We know that Z(n) <= n/4 (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one, and multiples of 25 contribute an extra, etc., but a safe upper bound is n/4 is an overestimate? Actually, we can use:\n\n        Z(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n   We can set an upper bound for n for a given m. Since Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/5 * (1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = n/5 * (5/4) = n/4.\n\n   So to have Z(n) >= m, we can set n_min = 0, n_max = 5*m (or maybe 5*m is too low? Consider: if m=100000, then n must be at least around 4*m? Actually, we can set an initial high value.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the high bound in the binary search to a value that is definitely larger than needed.\n\n   We know: Z(n) >= m, and Z(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4 (geometric series: sum_{k=1}^{infty} (n/5^k) = n/4).\n\n   So n must be at least 4*m? Actually, n/4 >= Z(n) >= m => n >= 4*m. But wait, that's not necessarily true because the geometric series is less than n/4. Actually, we have:\n\n        Z(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + 1/125 + ...) = n * (1/5)/(1-1/5) = n/4.\n\n   But wait, that is the limit. Actually, the sum is n/4 (if we take infinitely many terms). But since we stop at the term that is zero, Z(n) is less than n/4? Actually, no: the geometric series converges to n/4. So for sufficiently large n, Z(n) is approximately n/4. So we can set an upper bound: n_upper = 5 * m * 5? Actually, we can use:\n\n        n_upper = 5 * m   # but wait, for m=1, we need n>=5, so 5*1=5 is okay. But for m=5, we need n>=25, and 5*5=25, so okay. But wait, the function Z(n) is not linear. Actually, for m=5, the smallest n is 25, which is 5*5.\n\n        However, let's try m=6: the smallest n for Z(n)>=6 is 25 (since Z(25)=6). But 5*6=30, so we set n_upper=30, but we found 25 which is less.\n\n   Actually, we can set the upper bound for binary search to 5*m + 5 (or something) because the minimal n for Z(n)>=m is at most 5*m (actually, we know that Z(5*m) = 5*m/5 + 5*m/25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is >= m). But wait, Z(5*m) = Z(5*m) >= m (since Z(5*m) = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is more than m). So we can set:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m\n\n   However, note: sometimes we need more. For example, m=0: but m>=1. Also, the minimal n for Z(n)=m is at most 5*m, but wait: consider m=1, then n=5, which is 5*1. m=2: n=10, which is 5*2. m=3: n=15, which is 5*3. m=4: n=20, which is 5*4. m=5: n=25, which is 5*5. But wait, m=6: n=25, which is less than 5*6=30.\n\n   Actually, the minimal n for Z(n)=m is not always 5*m. But we know that Z(5*m) >= m (because Z(5*m) = m + m/5 + m/25 + ...). So the minimal n must be <= 5*m.\n\n   However, we are searching for the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m, so we can set the high bound to 5*m + 1 (to be safe). But for m=5, 5*m=25, and Z(25)=6>=5, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: what if m=100000? Then 5*m=500000, and Z(500000) is:\n\n        Z(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... \n\n        This is a geometric series: \n          term1 = 500000//5 = 100000\n          term2 = 100000\n          term3 = 20000\n          ... until the terms become 0.\n\n        We can compute: \n          = 100000 + 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 (approximately) \n\n        Actually, we can compute by:\n\n          n = 500000\n          s = 0\n          while n:\n              n //= 5\n              s += n\n\n        But we don't need to, because we are going to set the high bound to 5*m (500000) and that's acceptable.\n\n   However, 5*m for m=100000 is 500000, and we are doing two binary searches (each taking about log2(500000) which is about 19 iterations) and each iteration computes Z(n) which is O(log5(n)) (number of divisions by 5 until n becomes 0). That's acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem says m up to 100000, so we are doing two binary searches on n from 0 to 500000 (which is acceptable because 500000 is 5e5, and log2(5e5) is about 19, and each Z(n) calculation is about 7-8 divisions). So total operations is about 2 * 19 * (about 8) = 300, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we must consider that the minimal n for Z(n)>=m might be found at n<=5*m, but what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let m0 = m (given)\n\n   Define function zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        d = 5\n        while d <= n:\n            count += n // d\n            d *= 5\n\n   Then:\n\n        low_bound = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m\n        high_bound = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n        The count k = (high_bound - low_bound)\n\n        Then output:\n            print(k)\n            if k>0:\n                # print the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1, each on a new line? \n                # But the example output: \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\"\n                # So we output the count and then the numbers in increasing order, space separated? Actually, the example output format: \n                #   First line: k\n                #   Second line: the k integers in increasing order (if k>0)\n\n        However, note: the example input 1 outputs:\n            5\n            5 6 7 8 9\n\n        But if k is 0, then we only output 0.\n\n   But wait, what if m is so large that there is no n with Z(n) >= m? Actually, we know that Z(n) goes to infinity as n increases, so for any m, there exists n such that Z(n)>=m. Similarly for m+1.\n\n   However, we set the high bound to 5*m (for zeros(n)>=m) and 5*(m+1) for zeros(n)>=m+1. But note: our binary search for zeros(n)>=m might go beyond 5*m? Actually, we set the high bound to 5*m, but wait: \n\n        For the binary search, we set:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m   (for the first part)\n\n        Then, we are looking for the smallest n in [0, 5*m] such that zeros(n)>=m. But what if we don't find any? Then we must extend the high bound.\n\n   But we know that zeros(5*m) >= m (as shown above). So we are safe.\n\n   However, for the second part: zeros(n)>=m+1, we set the high bound to 5*(m+1) (or 5*m+5)? Actually, we can set the same high bound as for the first part: 5*m (but wait, zeros(5*m) might be much larger than m+1). Actually, we can set the high bound for the second part to 5*(m+1) to ensure we cover the minimal n for m+1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the high bound for both to 5*(m+1) (which is 500005 for m=100000) and that's acceptable.\n\n   But note: zeros(5*(m+1)) = zeros(5*m+5) which is definitely >= m+1 (because zeros(5*(m+1)) >= (5*(m+1))//5 = m+1). So we can set:\n\n        high_bound1 = 5*m   (for the first binary search) and high_bound2 = 5*(m+1) for the second.\n\n   Actually, let's do:\n\n        low1 = 0, high1 = 5*m   for the first search (minimal n for zeros(n)>=m)\n        low2 = 0, high2 = 5*(m+1) for the second search (minimal n for zeros(n)>=m+1)\n\n   But wait, the minimal n for zeros(n)>=m might be greater than 5*m? No, because we know zeros(5*m) >= m, so the minimal n is <=5*m.\n\n   However, for zeros(n)>=m+1, we must set the upper bound to at least 5*(m+1) because zeros(5*(m+1))>=m+1, so the minimal n for zeros(n)>=m+1 is <=5*(m+1).\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the upper bound for both to 5*(m+1) to simplify.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n        high = 5*(m+1)   for both binary searches.\n\n   Then:\n\n        Step 1: Binary search for the smallest n in [0, 5*(m+1)] such that zeros(n) >= m.\n        Step 2: Binary search for the smallest n in [0, 5*(m+1)] such that zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the answer is the interval [n1, n2-1] where n1 is the result of step1 and n2 the result of step2.\n\n   However, note: we must ensure that the first binary search finds n1 such that zeros(n1)>=m and for n1-1, zeros(n1-1)<m.\n\n   The binary search function:\n\n        def find_lower_bound(target, high=5*(m+1)):\n            low = 0\n            high = high\n            ans = high\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if zeros(mid) >= target:\n                    ans = mid\n                    high = mid-1\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n            return ans\n\n   Then:\n\n        n1 = find_lower_bound(m)   # smallest n with zeros(n)>=m\n        n2 = find_lower_bound(m+1)  # smallest n with zeros(n)>=m+1\n\n        Then the numbers are from n1 to n2-1.\n\n   But note: what if m is so large that n1 is the upper bound (5*(m+1))? Then zeros(n1)>=m, and zeros(n1-1) < m. Similarly for n2.\n\n   Example: m=1, then n1=5, n2=10, then numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   Example: m=5, then n1 = 25 (since zeros(25)=6>=5, and zeros(24)=4<5), and n2 = 125? Wait, no: zeros(25)=6, so the smallest n for zeros(n)>=6 is 25. Then the numbers for m=5 would be from 25 to 24? That's empty. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if m=6? Then n1 = smallest n with zeros(n)>=6 -> 25, and n2 = smallest n with zeros(n)>=7 -> ?\n\n        zeros(25)=6 -> not enough for 7.\n        zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7 (because 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1 =7)\n\n        So n2=30.\n\n        Then the numbers with exactly 6 zeros are from 25 to 29.\n\n        Let's check: \n          25: zeros=6\n          26: zeros=6 (because 26//5=5, 26//25=1 -> 5+1=6)\n          27: 5+1=6\n          28: 5+1=6\n          29: 5+1=6\n          30: 6+1=7\n\n        So indeed, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\n   So the code:\n\n        Read m (from stdin)\n\n        If m==0: then we need to handle separately? But the problem says m>=1, so skip.\n\n        Define zeros(n) function.\n\n        Set high_bound = 5*(m+1)\n\n        n1 = find_lower_bound(m, high_bound)\n        n2 = find_lower_bound(m+1, high_bound)\n\n        Then, the numbers are from n1 to n2-1.\n\n        Count = n2 - n1\n\n        Print(count)\n\n        If count>0, then print the numbers from n1 to n2-1 (each number on the same line, separated by spaces? The example output: \"5 6 7 8 9\")\n\n        But note: the example output format: first line is the count, second line is the numbers (if any).\n\n   However, the problem says:\n\n        First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n        Example: \n            Input: 1\n            Output: \n                5\n                5 6 7 8 9\n\n        But if k=0, then we only print 0.\n\n   One more edge: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n   However, let's consider m=100000, then the numbers from n1 to n2-1 might be a contiguous block of integers. But note: n1 and n2 might be very large (up to 500000) and the count might be huge (like 10^5 numbers) so we cannot output each number on a separate line? The problem says to output the numbers in increasing order. The example output for m=1 prints 5 numbers.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the maximum k. However, note that the zeros(n) function increases slowly. The gaps between consecutive zeros counts are at most 4 (because adding one number can add at most one factor of 5, unless the number is divisible by higher powers). Actually, the zeros(n) function is constant over intervals of length up to 4.\n\n   However, the set of n with exactly m zeros is an interval of consecutive integers. The length of this interval is the gap between two consecutive jumps (which are at multiples of 5). The gap can be 1,2,3,4, but note: the jump occurs at multiples of 5, so the gap is at most 4.\n\n   But wait: consider m=6: the interval was 25 to 29 (5 numbers). Actually, the gap between the start of m and the start of m+1 is the next multiple of 5 that adds a factor (like 25,30). So the gap is 5 numbers (from 25 to 29). \n\n   Actually, the zeros(n) function is constant on intervals that end at multiples of 5. So the length of the interval for m is (start of next multiple of 5 that causes an increase) - current start. \n\n   But note: the zeros(n) function increases by the exponent of 5 in n. For example, when n=25, we add two zeros (so it jumps from 4 to 6). So the interval for m=5 is empty, and the interval for m=6 starts at 25 and goes until 29 (which is 5 numbers). Then at 30, we add one (because 30 is divisible by 5 once) so zeros(30)=7, so m=6 is from 25 to 29.\n\n   Actually, the length of the interval for a given m is:\n\n        Let L = smallest n with zeros(n)=m (which is the same as our n1) and R = smallest n with zeros(n)=m+1 (which is our n2). Then the interval is [L, R-1] and the length is (R - L).\n\n   Since zeros(n) increases by the exponent of 5 in n, the gap between zeros(n) and zeros(n+1) is either 0 or 1 or more (if n is divisible by 25, then zeros(n) might be more than zeros(n-1) by 2). But the zeros(n) function is defined as the cumulative sum of exponents. The minimal n for which zeros(n) = m is n1, then the next jump (to m+1 or more) is at n2.\n\n   However, note: the zeros(n) function is non-decreasing and the difference between zeros(n) and zeros(n-1) is the exponent of 5 in n.\n\n   Therefore, the interval for m is contiguous and the length is (n2 - n1). \n\n   But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and the length of the interval for a given m can be 1,2,3,4, or 5? Actually, the zeros(n) function increases by the number of times 5 divides n. So if we are at a point where the next jump is due to a single factor of 5, then the interval length is 4 (because the next jump happens at the next multiple of 5). But if the jump is due to a multiple of 25 (which gives two zeros), then the interval length is 5 (because the next jump is 5 numbers away).\n\n   However, we don't need to know the length, we just need to output the numbers. But if the interval is long (like 5 numbers) then we output 5 numbers. But if the interval is very long? Actually, the zeros(n) function increases very slowly. For example, to get m=100000, we need n around 400000 (because zeros(n) ~ n/4). Then the interval for m=100000 might be just 5 numbers? Or maybe longer? \n\n   Actually, the zeros(n) function increases by the exponent of 5 in n. So if n is a power of 5, then the jump is large. But the minimal n for which zeros(n) >= 100000 is n1, and then the next jump (to 100001) is n2. The length of the interval is n2 - n1.\n\n   However, note that the zeros(n) function is constant except at multiples of 5. So the interval for m is the set of n from the first occurrence of m to the node just before the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase). But the increase is by the exponent of 5 in that multiple. So the length of the interval is determined by the next jump.\n\n   But regardless, we are only asked for the numbers. However, if the interval is large (like 100000 numbers) then we cannot output 100000 numbers because that would be too slow and use too much memory.\n\n   But note: the zeros(n) function is constant over intervals of 5 numbers (except at the jump points). Actually, the zeros(n) function increases only at multiples of 5. So the interval for a given m must be contained in a block of 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n   Let me think: \n\n        Consider n = 5*k. Then zeros(5*k) = zeros(5*(k-1)) + (exponent of 5 in k) + 1? Actually, no: \n\n        zeros(5*k) = zeros(5*k) = (5*k)//5 + (5*k)//25 + (5*k)//125 + ... \n                   = k + zeros(k) + (5*k)//25 + ... \n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n        zeros(5*k) = zeros(k) + k\n\n        But wait, let me check:\n\n            zeros(10) = 2, zeros(2)=0, 2+0=2 -> yes.\n            zeros(25) = 6, zeros(5)=1, 5+1=6 -> yes.\n\n        So zeros(5*k) = zeros(k) + k.\n\n        Then, zeros(5*k+1) = zeros(5*k) = zeros(k)+k, because 5*k+1 is not divisible by 5.\n\n        Similarly, zeros(5*k+2)=zeros(5*k+1)=...=zeros(5*k) until 5*k+4, and then zeros(5*k+5)=zeros(5*(k+1))=zeros(k+1)+(k+1).\n\n        Therefore, the zeros(n) function is constant on the intervals [5*k+1, 5*k+5] (with the understanding that 5*k+5 is the next multiple, and then the zeros(n) jumps at 5*k+5).\n\n        So the interval for a given m must be contained within a single block of 5 numbers? Not exactly: \n\n            Let k0 be the smallest k such that zeros(5*k0) >= m.\n\n            Then the zeros(n) for n from 5*k0 to 5*k0+4 is zeros(5*k0) (until we hit 5*k0+5, which is 5*(k0+1)).\n\n            But note: zeros(5*k0) = zeros(k0) + k0.\n\n            However, the zeros(n) for n from 5*k0 to 5*k0+4 is the same? \n\n            Actually, no: the zeros(n) function is the cumulative sum of exponents. It increases only at multiples of 5. So:\n\n                n from 5*k0 to 5*k0+4: the zeros(n) is the same as zeros(5*k0) because none of these numbers (except the starting one) are multiples of 5? Actually, the starting one is 5*k0, which is a multiple of 5. Then the next multiple is 5*k0+5.\n\n            But wait: what if k0 is such that 5*k0 is a multiple of 25? Then zeros(5*k0) includes the factor from 25, but then the next multiple (5*k0+5) might not be a multiple of 25, so the jump at 5*k0+5 is only by 1.\n\n            However, the zeros(n) function is computed by the formula: n//5 + n//25 + ... \n\n            The value at n=5*k0 is:\n\n                zeros(5*k0) = (5*k0)//5 + (5*k0)//25 + ... = k0 + zeros(k0) + ... \n\n            Then at n=5*k0+1,2,...,4, the value remains the same? \n\n            Let me check with k0=1 (then 5*k0=5):\n\n                zeros(5)=1, zeros(6)=1, zeros(7)=1, zeros(8)=1, zeros(9)=1, zeros(10)=2.\n\n            So the interval for m=1 is [5,9] (5 numbers). \n\n            Similarly, for k0=2 (then 5*k0=10): \n                zeros(10)=2, zeros(11)=2, zeros(12)=2, zeros(13)=2, zeros(14)=2, zeros(15)=3.\n\n            So the interval for m=2 is [10,14] (5 numbers).\n\n            For k0=5 (then 5*k0=25): \n                zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7.\n\n            So the interval for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers).\n\n            But wait, what about m=0? Then the interval is [1,4] (4 numbers). \n\n            However, m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n            Now, what about m=3? \n                zeros(15)=3, then zeros(16)=3, zeros(17)=3, zeros(18)=3, zeros(19)=3, zeros(20)=4.\n                So the interval for m=3 is [15,19] (5 numbers).\n\n            It seems that the interval for any m (except m=0) is always 5 numbers? \n\n            But wait, consider m=4:\n                zeros(20)=4, then zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6 -> so the interval for m=4 is [20,24] (5 numbers). But wait, zeros(25)=6, so the next jump is by 2 (because 25 is divisible by 5^2). So the zeros(n) function jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\n            Now, what about m=5? There is no n with zeros(n)=5. \n\n            Therefore, the length of the interval for a given m is either 5 or 0 (if m is skipped). \n\n            But wait, is that always true?\n\n            Consider a larger jump: say m=26. How do we compute zeros(125)=3+2+1=6? Actually, zeros(125)=125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 = 25+5+1=31.\n\n            How about zeros(100)=24, zeros(101)=24, ... until zeros(124)=24, zeros(125)=31.\n\n            Then the interval for m=25,26,...,30 is empty? \n\n            Actually, zeros(100)=24, zeros(124)=24, zeros(",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count is effectively given by the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term continues until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values are those in the interval \\([ \\text{lower\\_bound}, \\text{upper\\_bound} - 1 ]\\).\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( Z(\\text{lower\\_bound}) > m \\)), then there are zero solutions. Otherwise, the solutions form a contiguous block of integers from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    d = 5\n    while d <= n:\n        count += n // d\n        d *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    high_bound = 5 * (m + 1)\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        low = 0\n        high = high_bound\n        ans = high_bound\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if zeros(mid) >= target:\n                ans = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return ans\n\n    n1 = find_lower_bound(m)\n    n2 = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    count = n2 - n1\n    print(count)\n    if count > 0:\n        numbers = list(range(n1, n2))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search (`find_lower_bound`)**: This function uses binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is bounded by \\( 5 \\times (\\text{target} + 1) \\), ensuring the solution is found within a reasonable range.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the lower and upper bounds for \\( n \\) using binary search, and then checks if there are any valid \\( n \\) values. If there are, it prints the count followed by the valid \\( n \\) values in increasing order; otherwise, it just prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using mathematical insights and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000).",
