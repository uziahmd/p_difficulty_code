Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any extra whitespace including newline) to get the combined string.\n - Sort the combined string and the third string (the pile) and compare.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined string = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile string = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, if we sort both, they should be identical.\n\n But wait: let's check the example input provided in the note:\n\n Example 1:\n   Guest: 'SANTACLAUS'\n   Host: 'DEDMOROZ'\n   Pile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   Combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> but note: the pile has \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is actually the same multiset as the combined?\n\n   Let me break down:\n\n   Combined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> \n        Count: \n          S: 3 (from SANTA: 2, then CLAUS:1 -> total 3? Actually: \n          SANTACLAUS: S appears at index0 and then in CLAUS? No, wait: \n          SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> so two S's? Then DEDMOROZ: no S. So two S's in total for combined?\n          But the pile has two S's too? \n\n   Actually, let's count the entire combined string and the pile:\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n     S: 2 (from SANTACLAUS: two S's? Actually: \n        SANTA: two S's? Actually: \n          SANTACLAUS: \n            S at position0 and then at the last letter? \n            Let me write: S A N T A C L A U S -> that's two S's.\n\n     Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        S: 3? because it has \"SANTA\" (two S's) and then \"DEDCLAUS\": one more S -> total three.\n\n   Wait, this doesn't match. But the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   Let me re-read the example: the example input is given as a string with three parts.\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But wait, the example input string is given as:\n\n        \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   That means the first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", second line \"DEDMOROZ\", and third line \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Now, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Let's count the frequency:\n\n   Combined: \n        S: 2 (from SANTACLAUS: two S's, and DEDMOROZ: none) -> total 2\n        A: 3 (SANTACLAUS: three A's? Actually: \n            SANTA: two A's, CLAUS: one A -> total 3)\n        N: 1\n        T: 1\n        C: 1\n        L: 1\n        U: 1\n        D: 3 (DEDMOROZ: D appears twice? DED: two D's and then MOROZ: no D -> wait: DEDMOROZ: \n            D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> two D's)\n        E: 1\n        O: 2 (MORO",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (frequency count) of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters from the combined names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to verify that the letters in the pile are exactly the same as those in the concatenated guest and host names, with no extra or missing letters. This means both the counts of each letter must match exactly between the combined names and the pile.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile string, we can directly compare them. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the required names; otherwise, it cannot.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Reading the three input lines.\n   - Concatenating the first two lines to form the target string.\n   - Sorting both the target string and the pile string.\n   - Comparing the sorted strings. If they match, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The dominant operation is sorting the strings. Given the maximum length of each line is 100, the total length of the combined string and the pile string is at most 200 characters. Sorting these strings is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings (up to 200), which is optimal for this problem size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n- **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the combined string and the pile string are sorted. If the sorted versions are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters to form the combined names, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks the letter counts by leveraging sorting, which is straightforward and effective for the given constraints. This approach ensures correctness by matching both the presence and quantity of each letter.",
