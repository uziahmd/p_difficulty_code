Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players take turns removing the leftmost digit from A and appending it to their own number.\n Each player makes exactly n moves. Initially, both numbers (S1 and S2) are empty.\n\n We have to output a string of 2n characters (each character is either 'H' or 'M') that specifies the sequence of moves.\n The goal is to maximize the total prize which is the sum of the two numbers (converted to integers) at the end.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"If there are several solutions, output any of them.\"\n\n How to think?\n Let the entire sequence of moves be a string of length 2n, with exactly n 'H' and n 'M'. \n The first move is determined by the first character (either H or M). Then the next, etc.\n\n But note: the moves are interleaved. The first move (first character) will take the first digit of A and assign it to either Homer or Marge.\n\n How does the assignment work?\n At each step i, the current leftmost digit d is taken and assigned to the player whose turn it is (Homer for 'H', Marge for 'M').\n\n After all moves, we have two numbers: \n   S1 (the digits assigned to Homer in the order of his moves) and \n   S2 (the digits assigned to Marge in the order of her moves).\n\n The total prize is the numerical value of S1 plus the numerical value of S2.\n\n Since leading zeros are allowed, we have to consider the entire string of digits for each player.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A='1234'\n\n   Possibilities: \n     Option 1: \"HHMM\"\n        First move (H): takes '1' -> S1 becomes \"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n        Second move (H): takes '2' -> S1 becomes \"12\", A becomes \"34\"\n        Third move (M): takes '3' -> S2 becomes \"3\", A becomes \"4\"\n        Fourth move (M): takes '4' -> S2 becomes \"34\"\n\n        Total prize = 12 + 34 = 46\n\n     Option 2: \"HMHM\"\n        First move (H): takes '1' -> S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n        Second move (M): takes '2' -> S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n        Third move (H): takes '3' -> S1=\"13\", A=\"4\"\n        Fourth move (M): takes '4' -> S2=\"24\"\n\n        Total prize = 13 + 24 = 37\n\n     Option 3: \"HM MH\" (i.e., \"HMMH\")\n        First move (H): '1' -> S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n        Second move (M): '2' -> S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n        Third move (M): '3' -> S2=\"23\", A=\"4\"\n        Fourth move (H): '4' -> S1=\"14\"\n\n        Total prize = 14 + 23 = 37\n\n     Option 4: \"MMHH\"\n        First move (M): '1' -> S2=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n        Second move (M): '2' -> S2=\"12\", A=\"34\"\n        Third move (H): '3' -> S1=\"3\", A=\"4\"\n        Fourth move (H): '4' -> S1=\"34\"\n\n        Total prize = 34 + 12 = 46\n\n So two sequences give 46: \"HHMM\" and \"MMHH\".\n\n Since the problem allows any solution, we can choose one.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Observation: The entire process splits the digits of A into two sequences (for Homer and Marge). The order of the digits for each player is fixed by the order of the moves.\n\n However, note that the moves are interleaved. The key is that the first n moves for Homer (if we consider his moves) will be distributed arbitrarily in the sequence? Actually, no: the entire sequence has 2n moves and we know that each player must have n moves.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from the leftmost of the remaining string. Therefore, the assignment of digits to players is predetermined by the order of moves.\n\n However, we have control over the order of moves (we can decide at each step who goes first, but note: the problem says they determine before each turn). But we are to find a sequence that maximizes the total.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total length is 36. We cannot iterate over all C(36,18) possibilities (which is about 9e9). However, we can use dynamic programming or state space search.\n\n But note: the state would be the current index (from 0 to 2n-1) and how many moves each player has made so far (from 0 to n). That is 2n * (n+1) * (n+1) states, which is 36*19*19 ~ 13000 states. And then we have to consider transitions: at each state we have two choices if both players haven't reached n moves? Actually, no: the sequence must be alternating? \n\n Wait, note: the problem does not say that the moves must alternate. It says: \"Before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\" and each player must make exactly n moves. \n\n But the example outputs do alternate. However, note the example input ['2\\n1234'] gives output ['HHMM'] and also the other example ['2\\n9911'] gives output ['HMHM'].\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"On its turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si.\" and \"each player should make exactly n moves.\"\n\n There's no restriction that they must alternate? But wait, the example outputs are alternating. However, note: the example input 2 and 9911 gives output \"HMHM\", which is alternating. Similarly, the first example output is \"HHMM\", which is two consecutive H and two consecutive M.\n\n But actually, the rules say: \"each player should make exactly n moves\". There is no explicit requirement that they alternate. However, the problem says: \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move\", meaning that we can choose arbitrarily (even consecutively). \n\n However, the example outputs are alternating. Why? Because the problem examples are given as alternating. But note: the problem statement says: \"If there are several solutions, output any of them.\"\n\n So we can output non-alternating sequences too? Let me check with the example: \n\n Example: n=2, A='1234'\n\n Consider a non-alternating sequence: \"HHMM\" (already considered) and \"MMHH\" (also considered). What about \"HMMM\"? That would be: \n   First: H -> takes '1'\n   Second: H -> takes '2'\n   Third: M -> takes '3'\n   Fourth: M -> takes '4'\n\n But wait, that's the same as \"HHMM\". Similarly, \"MMMM\" is not allowed because each player must make n moves (here n=2, so each must make 2 moves). \n\n Actually, the sequence must have exactly n H's and n M's. And the moves are taken from the leftmost of A.\n\n Now, the catch: the value of the numbers depends on the order of the digits. For example, if a player gets digits [a, b] then the number is 10*a + b. If they get [b, a] then it's 10*b + a.\n\n But note: the digits are taken in the order of the moves. However, the moves are from left to right. So if a player takes the first digit and then the third, the second digit is taken by the other player in between.\n\n We need to maximize:\n   Value(S1) + Value(S2)\n\n How do we assign the digits to the two players?\n\n We have to assign the first 2n digits (in order) to two players, each getting n digits. However, the assignment must be such that the digits are taken in order (so the i-th digit of the entire string must be assigned to one of the players, and the assignment must be consistent with the removal: the moves are from left to right, so the k-th move (whatever player) takes the k-th digit from the original string? No, wait: \n\n Actually, the process is: \n   Start with A = d1 d2 d3 ... d_{2n}\n   Move 1: remove d1 and assign to the first player.\n   Move 2: remove d2 and assign to the second player (if the second move is by the other) or the same?\n   But note: after move 1, A becomes d2 d3 ... d_{2n}. Then move 2: the leftmost is d2.\n\n So the j-th digit of the original string is always taken at the j-th overall move.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of digits is split by the sequence: the digits are assigned in the order of the moves. The only choice is which player gets which digit (with the constraint that one player gets n digits and the other n digits) and the timing (which move) doesn't matter for the digit itself, but matters for the order of the digits in the number.\n\n However, note: the number for a player is built by the digits taken in the order of the moves. For example, if Homer takes the first and third moves, then his number is the digit from the first move followed by the digit from the third move.\n\n Therefore, the value for Homer is: \n   Let the indices (in the original string) that Homer takes be i1, i2, ..., in (with i1 < i2 < ... < in). Then his number is \n        D = d_{i1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i2} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{in}\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n So the total prize is the sum of these two numbers.\n\n We need to assign the 2n digits (each appearing once) to two sets of n digits, and then the value for each set is computed by the base-10 representation (each digit's place is determined by the position in the set, with the earliest taken being the most significant).\n\n How to maximize the total?\n\n We can consider: \n   Let x be the set of digits that go to Homer and y the set for Marge. Then the total prize is:\n\n        F(x,y) = [ (digit at the first move by Homer) * 10^(n-1) + ... ] + [ (digit at the first move by Marge) * 10^(n-1) + ... ]\n\n But note: the moves are interleaved, so the assignment of the digits to the players does not change the fact that the digits are taken in increasing index order. However, the order in which the digits are taken by a player is the same as the order of appearance in A.\n\n Therefore, we can rephrase the problem:\n\n We have a sequence of 2n digits. We wish to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge, such that each gets n digits. Then, for Homer, we form the number by taking his digits in the order of the original occurrence (i.e., the relative order in A) and similarly for Marge.\n\n Then, the total prize is the numerical value of Homer's number plus the numerical value of Marge's number.\n\n We wish to maximize this total.\n\n But note: the sequence of moves must be a string of 2n characters (each either 'H' or 'M') with exactly n of each. However, the problem does not require that the moves alternate. But the assignment of digits to players is independent of the order of moves? Actually, no: the moves are sequential and the digits are removed from the left. The assignment of a digit to a player is determined by the move at which it is taken, and the moves are fixed by the sequence.\n\n However, note: the digit at position i is always taken at move i (because we remove the leftmost at each move). Therefore, the set of digits assigned to Homer is exactly the set of digits at the positions where the move was 'H'. Similarly for Marge.\n\n Then, the value for Homer is: \n        Sum_{k=1}^{n} (digit at the k-th H move) * 10^( (number of H moves after this one) ) \n\n But wait, let me explain:\n\n Suppose we have the sequence of moves: \n        H, M, H, M, ... \n\n Then the first H gets the first digit (at position 1) and the second H gets the third digit (at position 3). The value for Homer is: \n        d1 * 10^(1) + d3 * 10^0   (if n=2)\n\n However, if the sequence is:\n        H, H, M, M, ...\n\n Then the first H gets the first digit (at position 1) and the second H gets the second digit (at position 2). Then the value for Homer is: \n        d1 * 10^(1) + d2 * 10^0.\n\n So the value of a digit in a player's number depends on the position (i.e., the time) at which it was taken relative to the other digits taken by the same player.\n\n Therefore, we cannot separate the assignment from the timing. The value of a digit depends on when it is taken (i.e., the order of moves) because the more significant digits (higher power) are taken earlier.\n\n This is a knapsack-like problem with two dimensions: the index and the counts. However, note that the digits are fixed in order.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n We have 2n digits. We wish to assign each digit to either H or M, with exactly n for each. Then, the value for H is computed by: \n        Let the indices (in the original string) where H appears be i1, i2, ..., in (in increasing order). Then \n            H_value = d_i1 * 10^(n-1) + d_i2 * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_in * 10^0\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n Then the total value is H_value + M_value.\n\n How to maximize this?\n\n We can use dynamic programming:\n\n Let dp[i][j] = maximum total value we can achieve from the first i digits, having assigned j digits to Homer (and i-j to Marge). \n\n But note: the value of a digit depends on its position in the player's own sequence. \n\n However, we don't know the future. The digit at position i will be placed in the player's number at a certain significance, which depends on how many digits that player will take after this one.\n\n Alternatively, we can use state (i, a, b) where i is the index (from 0 to 2n-1), a is the number of H's so far, and b is the number of M's so far (but note: we know a+b=i). Then the total value is the sum for H and M so far, but we have to account for the future significance.\n\n Actually, we can break down the contribution:\n\n When we assign a digit d (at current index) to a player, we know that the player will have (n - current_count) digits left to take. Then the current digit will be multiplied by 10^( (n - current_count - 1) ) for that player? \n\n But wait, the current digit is the next one to be appended, so it will be the least significant among the remaining digits for that player? Actually, no: the player's number is built by the digits in the order of the moves. The current digit is taken now, so it will be the next digit to be added (in the order of the entire sequence). However, the entire sequence of moves might interleave the rest.\n\n Actually, we can precompute the power of 10 for each digit based on the total number of moves the player will have from the current point to the end.\n\n Specifically, for a given player, if they have already taken k digits and will take (n - k) more, then the current digit (if assigned to them) will be placed at the (k)-th position (0-indexed from the beginning) of their number. Therefore, its weight is 10^( (n - k - 1) ).\n\n But note: the entire sequence of moves is fixed, and we are processing the digits in order. We know the entire string A.\n\n However, we are building the two numbers simultaneously. The value for the two numbers is:\n\n   For Homer: \n        Let h0, h1, ..., h_{n-1} be the digits he takes (in the order of the moves, so the order of the indices in A). Then his number is sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (h_j * 10^(n-1-j))\n\n   Similarly for Marge.\n\n Now, the catch: the digits are taken in increasing index order, but the assignment to players can be arbitrary (as long as each gets n). However, the relative order of the digits for a given player is fixed by the original A.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the contribution of a digit d at position i (0-indexed) if it is assigned to a player, if that player has taken k digits so far (from the first i digits) then the digit d will be the (k)-th digit (0-indexed) for that player, and hence will be multiplied by 10^(n - k - 1).\n\n But wait, we don't know the future. We know that the player will take n-k more digits, so the current digit will be the (k)-th (so the exponent is n - k - 1) because the first digit taken by the player (if any) will be multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n However, we are processing from left to right. We can do:\n\n   dp[i][a] = maximum total value achievable from the first i digits (i from 0 to 2n) with a digits assigned to Homer (and i-a to Marge). \n\n   Then, when we process the i-th digit (0-indexed, so the digit A[i]), we have two choices: assign to Homer or to Marge.\n\n   If we assign to Homer, then the current digit A[i] (which is a char, convert to int) will be multiplied by 10^(n - a - 1) [because currently Homer has a digits, so he will have n - a digits left, and this digit is the (a)-th one (so the exponent is n - a - 1)].\n\n   Then the state becomes dp[i+1][a+1] and we add the value from this digit for Homer.\n\n   Similarly, if we assign to Marge, then the digit is multiplied by 10^(n - (i-a) - 1) [because Marge has taken (i-a) so far, so she will have n - (i-a) moves left].\n\n   But wait, we are using the entire string and we know the entire assignment? Actually, we are processing sequentially and the assignment is independent of the rest? \n\n However, note: the exponent for the digit depends on the total number of digits the player will take (which is n) and how many they have taken so far. \n\n But here's the issue: the exponent for a digit depends on the total count of digits the player will take (which is fixed, n) and the number of digits the player has taken up to now (which is a for Homer and i-a for Marge). \n\n However, the catch: the same digit, if assigned to Homer, will always have the same exponent? Yes, because the exponent is determined by the position of the digit in the sequence of Homer's moves. \n\n But note: we are processing from left to right. The digit we are at is the i-th. In the final assignment, the digit will appear at a specific position in the player's number. However, the player's number is built by the digits taken in the order of the moves. Since we are processing the entire sequence, we can assume that the digits are taken in increasing index order (which they are, because we remove from the left). \n\n But the exponent for a digit assigned to a player is determined by the total number of digits that player will take from the entire sequence and the order in which they are taken. \n\n However, we are only at the i-th digit. We know that the player will take n digits in total, and we know that we have taken a digits for Homer so far (from the first i digits). Then the current digit is the (a)-th digit for Homer (if assigned) and will be placed at the (a)-th position (0-indexed) in Homer's number. The significance is 10^(n-1-a). \n\n Similarly, for Marge: if we assign the digit, then it is the (i-a)-th digit for Marge (because Marge has taken i-a digits from the first i digits) and the total number of digits Marge will take is n, so the current digit will be the (i-a)-th digit (0-indexed) and will have exponent 10^(n-1-(i-a)).\n\n But wait, what if we have already used some digits? The exponent for a digit in the final number is determined by the order of the moves (which is the same as the order of the digits in A) for that player. \n\n However, note: the moves are interleaved. The digit we are assigning now is the i-th digit. In the entire sequence, the next digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) might be assigned to the same player. Then the current digit is the (a)-th digit for Homer, and there will be n - a - 1 digits that Homer will take later. Therefore, the current digit's place is 10^( (n - a - 1) ). \n\n Example: n=2, assign the first digit (a=0) to Homer: then the current digit is the 0-th digit (so the most significant) and will be multiplied by 10^(2-0-1)=10^1.\n\n Then if we assign the second digit (if we assign it to Homer) then a becomes 1, and the second digit is the 1st digit (least significant) and multiplied by 10^(2-1-1)=10^0.\n\n Similarly, if we assign the first digit to Marge, then the first digit (at position0) is the 0-th digit for Marge, so multiplied by 10^(2-0-1)=10^1.\n\n Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n   dp[i][a] = maximum total value from the first i digits, with a digits assigned to Homer (so i-a to Marge)\n\n   Then, for the next digit (i-th, 0-indexed, so we are at the i-th digit, and we are going to assign it):\n\n   Option 1: assign to Homer.\n        Then, the value from this digit for Homer is: int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - a - 1))\n        Then, the state becomes dp[i+1][a+1] and we add this value.\n\n        But note: we are also adding the value from Marge? Actually, the total value is the sum from both players.\n\n        However, in the state we are tracking the total value. Then we can update:\n\n            dp[i+1][a+1] = max(dp[i+1][a+1], dp[i][a] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - a - 1)))\n\n   Option 2: assign to Marge.\n        The value from this digit for Marge is: int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (i - a) - 1))\n        Then, dp[i+1][a] = max(dp[i+1][a], dp[i][a] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i - a) - 1)))\n\n However, note: the exponent for Marge is determined by the number of moves Marge has taken so far (which is i - a) and the total moves for Marge is n, so the current move (if assigned to Marge) is the (i - a)-th move for Marge, and the remaining moves for Marge are n - (i - a). The current digit's significance is 10^(n - (i - a) - 1).\n\n But wait, what if we have taken more than n for one player? We must ensure that we don't exceed n for either.\n\n Constraints: \n   a from 0 to n (and i from 0 to 2n, and a <= min(i, n) and i-a <= n, so a>= i-n).\n\n However, the above recurrence does not account for the fact that the digit is used only once. And we are processing each digit.\n\n But note: the state dimension is i (from 0 to 2n) and a (from 0 to n). The total states is 2n * (n+1) = 36*19 = 684, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must also note: the exponent for Marge: n - (i - a) - 1. But note: (i - a) is the count for Marge so far, and we are at digit i (0-indexed). The total digits processed is i+1 (if we include the current one). \n\n But wait: our state dp[i][a] is for the first i digits (so i from 0 to 2n, and we are about to process the i-th digit). Actually, we should index by the number of digits processed.\n\n Let me redefine:\n\n   Let dp[i][a] = maximum total value from the first i digits (i from 0 to 2n), with a digits assigned to Homer (and i-a to Marge). \n\n   Then, for the next digit (the i-th digit, which is the (i)-th in zero-indexed) we have:\n\n   Option 1: assign to Homer, if a < n.\n        value_Homer = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - a - 1))\n        Then, dp[i+1][a+1] = max(dp[i+1][a+1], dp[i][a] + value_Homer + (value from Marge?))\n\n   But wait, the above recurrence only adds the current digit's contribution. However, the state dp[i][a] already includes the contributions from the first i digits. Then we add the current digit's contribution (for the chosen player) and that's it.\n\n   Similarly for Marge.\n\n However, note: the exponent for the current digit for Marge is: \n        exponent = n - (number of Marge's moves so far) - 1 = n - (i - a) - 1.\n\n But wait, the number of Marge's moves so far is (i - a) because we have processed i digits and a of them went to Homer. However, the current digit is the (i)-th (0-indexed) and we are about to assign it, so the Marge's count so far is (i - a) (from the first i digits) and then we are adding one more for Marge, so the current digit is the (i - a + 1)-th? \n\n Actually, no: in the state dp[i][a], we have processed i digits and assigned a to Homer and (i-a) to Marge. Then we are processing the i-th digit (the next one). So the current digit is the (i)-th (0-indexed) and the Marge's count so far is (i - a). Then the current digit for Marge (if assigned) is the (i - a + 1)-th? \n\n But wait, the exponents are determined by the order of the moves. The move that assigns this digit is the (i+1)-th move. For Marge, the total number of moves she will make is n, and she has already made (i - a) moves (from the first i digits). Then the current digit is the (i - a)-th move for Marge? \n\n Actually, no: the moves are numbered by the entire sequence. The first move is the first digit, the second move is the second digit, etc. The assignment to Marge is not necessarily contiguous. \n\n However, the exponent for a digit assigned to Marge is determined by the number of digits that Marge will take from the entire sequence (which is n) and the number of digits she has taken so far (from the first i digits) is (i - a). Then the current digit is the (i - a)-th digit that Marge takes (because the moves are sequential and we are at the (i+1)-th move, but the assignment to Marge so far is (i - a) and then we are adding one more). \n\n But note: the exponent is 10^(n - (i - a) - 1) because the current digit is the (i - a)-th digit for Marge (0-indexed) and there will be (n - (i - a) - 1) digits that Marge will take after this one.\n\n However, wait: the entire sequence has 2n moves. The digit we are at is the i-th (0-indexed). The moves that Marge will take are spread arbitrarily. The current digit is the (i - a)-th digit for Marge (because we have seen i digits and a of them are Homer, so i-a are Marge). Then the remaining digits for Marge are n - (i - a) (including the current one). Actually, we are including the current one, so the remaining after the current one is n - (i - a) - 1.\n\n So the exponent is 10^(n - (i - a) - 1).\n\n Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n   dp[0][0] = 0\n\n   for i in range(0, 2*n):\n        for a in range(0, n+1):\n            if dp[i][a] is not set, skip.\n            # Option 1: assign the i-th digit (A[i]) to Homer, if a < n\n            if a < n:\n                # The current digit is the a-th digit for Homer (so far)\n                exp = n - a - 1\n                value_here = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exp)\n                # Then update dp[i+1][a+1]\n                candidate = dp[i][a] + value_here\n                if candidate > dp[i+1][a+1]:\n                    dp[i+1][a+1] = candidate\n\n            # Option 2: assign to Marge, if (i - a) < n (because Marge must have less than n moves)\n            if (i - a) < n:\n                exp = n - (i - a) - 1\n                value_here = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exp)\n                candidate = dp[i][a] + value_here\n                if candidate > dp[i+1][a]:\n                    dp[i+1][a] = candidate\n\n   Then, we look for the state dp[2*n][n] (since we need exactly n for each) and the maximum value.\n\n However, we also need to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n Alternatively, we can store the decisions (whether we assigned to Homer or Marge) in a separate table.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute dp[i][a] for i in [0, 2n] and a in [0, n] (using the recurrence above).\n\n   Step 2: Reconstruct the sequence from the end.\n\n   We start at i = 2n, a = n.\n\n   Then, we look at how we got to this state.\n\n   However, note: the recurrence does not record which choice was made. So we can use a parent pointer or a separate table.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the decision (Homer or Marge) for each state.\n\n   Let's define:\n\n        dp[i][a] = maximum total value for the first i digits, a for Homer.\n\n        and we can store a table choice[i][a] = 0 for Marge, 1 for Homer, or None if not updated.\n\n   But note: we update from two states: \n        From (i, a) we can come from (i-1, a-1) by assigning the (i-1)-th digit to Homer, or from (i-1, a) by assigning to Marge.\n\n   Actually, we are iterating i from 0 to 2n, so we can store the last move.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do backward reconstruction:\n\n        We know that the last move (2n-1) was either assigned to Homer or Marge. But we don't know which.\n\n   However, note: at the last move (i=2n-1) we have two possibilities: \n        Either the last digit was assigned to Homer (then a_prev = n-1, and then we update dp[2n][n] from dp[2n-1][n-1]) OR to Marge (then a_prev = n, and we update dp[2n][n] from dp[2n-1][n]).\n\n   But wait: we require that at the end both have n moves. So the last move must be assigned to the player who has n-1 moves at that time.\n\n   Therefore, we can reconstruct backwards:\n\n        Let i = 2n, a = n.\n        We know that the last move (the (2n-1)-th digit) was assigned to the player that had n-1 moves at i=2n-1.\n\n        So if we came from Homer, then the state before was (2n-1, n-1) and the move was 'H'.\n        If we came from Marge, then the state before was (2n-1, n) and the move was 'M'.\n\n        But wait, in our recurrence, for the state (2n, n) we could have been reached from:\n            Option 1: (2n-1, n-1) by assigning the last digit to Homer (then a becomes n)\n            Option 2: (2n-1, n) by assigning the last digit to Marge (then a remains n)\n\n        However, at state (2n-1, n): that means we have processed 2n-1 digits and assigned n to Homer and n-1 to Marge. Then the last digit (the 2n-1-th) is assigned to Marge, and then we get state (2n, n).\n\n        Similarly, state (2n-1, n-1) is valid because we have processed 2n-1 digits and assigned n-1 to Homer and n to Marge (so i=2n-1, a=n-1, then Marge has (2n-1 - (n-1)) = n digits? No, wait: i=2n-1, a=n-1, then Marge has (2n-1 - (n-1)) = n digits. But then we cannot assign to Marge because Marge already has n moves? \n\n        Actually, in the recurrence for Marge we check: if (i - a) < n. In state (2n-1, n-1): i=2n-1, a=n-1, then Marge has (2n-1 - (n-1)) = n digits. Then we cannot assign the last digit to Marge (because that would make Marge have n+1, which is not allowed). \n\n        Therefore, the last move must be assigned to Homer.\n\n        Similarly, the first move: we can assign to either.\n\n   Algorithm for reconstruction:\n\n        We'll create a 2D array (or dictionary) parent[i][a] = (prev_i, prev_a, move) \n        But we can do:\n\n        Let ans = [] (to store the moves from last to first)\n\n        i = 2*n, a = n\n        while i > 0:\n            # Check if the last move was Homer: then we must have come from (i-1, a-1)\n            if a > 0 and dp[i][a] == dp[i-1][a-1] + (int(A[i-1]) * (10**(n - (a-1) - 1)): \n                Then the move was 'H'\n                Then we set the (i-1)-th digit (0-indexed) to 'H', and update i = i-1, a = a-1.\n\n            else if (i - a) > 0 and dp[i][a] == dp[i-1][a] + (int(A[i-1]) * (10**(n - ((i-1) - a) - 1)):\n                Then the move was 'M'\n                Then we set the (i-1)-th digit to 'M', and update i = i-1, a = a.\n\n            But wait, we don't know the exact value of the digit? Actually, we can store the entire dp table and the computation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the parent information.\n\n   However, note: the exponent for the digit at position i-1 (0-indexed) when assigned to Homer is 10^(n - (a-1) - 1) = 10^(n - a) (if we are at state (i, a) and we are checking the previous state (i-1, a-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns removing digits from the left end of a given number A. Each player must make exactly n moves, and the goal is to find a sequence of moves that maximizes the sum of the numerical values of the numbers each player constructs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves splitting the digits of the number A into two sequences (one for each player) such that each player ends up with exactly n digits. The numerical value of each player's sequence depends on the order in which they collect the digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal assignment of digits to players to maximize the sum of their numerical values.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][a]` where `i` represents the number of digits processed so far, and `a` represents the number of digits assigned to Homer. The value `dp[i][a]` stores the maximum total prize achievable after processing the first `i` digits with `a` digits assigned to Homer.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit at position `i`, we consider two choices:\n   - **Assign to Homer**: The digit's contribution to the total prize is calculated based on its position in Homer's sequence (determined by how many digits he has already taken).\n   - **Assign to Marge**: Similarly, the digit's contribution is calculated based on its position in Marge's sequence.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the state `(2n, n)` to determine the sequence of moves (Homer or Marge) that leads to the maximum prize. The backtracking involves checking whether each digit was assigned to Homer or Marge based on the DP transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    \n    dp = [[-1] * (n+1) for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    parent = [[''] * (n+1) for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    \n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for a in range(n+1):\n            if dp[i][a] == -1:\n                continue\n                \n            if a < n:\n                exp = n - a - 1\n                value_here = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exp)\n                new_val = dp[i][a] + value_here\n                if dp[i+1][a+1] < new_val:\n                    dp[i+1][a+1] = new_val\n                    parent[i+1][a+1] = 'H'\n                    \n            remaining_M = i - a\n            if remaining_M < n:\n                exp = n - remaining_M - 1\n                value_here = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exp)\n                new_val = dp[i][a] + value_here\n                if dp[i+1][a] < new_val:\n                    dp[i+1][a] = new_val\n                    parent[i+1][a] = 'M'\n    \n    seq = []\n    i = total_digits\n    a = n\n    while i > 0:\n        move_char = parent[i][a]\n        seq.append(move_char)\n        if move_char == 'H':\n            i -= 1\n            a -= 1\n        else:\n            i -= 1\n            \n    seq.reverse()\n    print(''.join(seq))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`. The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum prize achievable for each state `(i, a)`, and `parent` keeps track of the last move (Homer or Marge) that led to each state.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: For each digit in `A`, the algorithm checks if assigning it to Homer or Marge yields a better total prize. The contribution of each digit is calculated based on its position in the respective player's sequence (using powers of 10).\n\n3. **Backtracking**: Starting from the state `(2n, n)`, the algorithm reconstructs the sequence of moves by following the parent pointers. Each move is appended to the result, which is then reversed to produce the final sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring the maximum total prize for both players.",
