Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (because A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D].\n\n We need to count the number of triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   x+y > z.\n\n Since x, y, z are independent in their ranges, we can try to fix two variables and then compute the valid range for the third.\n\n Alternatively, we can use inclusion-exclusion or iterate over one variable and then use two pointers or binary search for the others.\n\n However, note the constraints: A, B, C, D up to 500000. So we cannot iterate over all possibilities (which would be O(B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1) and that might be too large).\n\n We need to count without iterating over each triple.\n\n Let's reframe:\n\n Conditions:\n   x >= A, x <= B.\n   y >= B, y <= C.\n   z >= C, z <= D.\n\n And we require x+y > z.\n\n We can also note: the triangle inequality with x<=y<=z implies that the only condition we need to check is x+y>z.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can fix x and y, then z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] (since z must be at least C and less than x+y). But note: also z must be at most D.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over x from A to B and y from B to C because that would be (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, too slow.\n\n Instead, we can try to fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, but note that x,y are in fixed ranges.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix x and then for each x, consider the range of y and then the range of z.\n\n But note: the condition is on x+y and z. Another way is to fix z, then the condition becomes x+y > z. Then we can count the pairs (x,y) in the given ranges such that x+y > z.\n\n Then, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   for z from C to D:\n        count += number of pairs (x,y) such that x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y > z\n\n Then, we need to count for each z, the number of (x,y) with x+y>z.\n\n How to count pairs (x,y) for a fixed z?\n\n Conditions for (x,y): \n   x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and x+y > z.\n\n We can precompute the counts for pairs (x,y) without iterating over each pair? \n\n Note: The set of pairs (x,y) is a rectangle in the grid [A,B] x [B,C]. The condition x+y>z is a half-plane.\n\n We can also use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of counting the pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z and subtract from the total pairs.\n\n Total pairs: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) [if we didn't have the condition x+y>z]. But wait, we don't want to iterate over z first because the ranges for x and y are fixed.\n\n Actually, we can precompute the entire set of pairs (x,y) and then for each z, we want to know how many pairs satisfy x+y>z.\n\n But note: we have to do this for each z from C to D. We cannot iterate over all pairs for each z.\n\n Instead, we can precompute an array F(t) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = t, for t from (A+B) to (B+C). Then, the number of pairs with x+y>z is the sum_{t=z+1}^{B+C} F(t).\n\n Then, the answer would be: for each z from C to D, add the sum_{t=z+1}^{B+C} F(t).\n\n But note: the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). And we can also compute the cumulative distribution.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the frequency array for x+y, where x from [A,B] and y from [B,C].\n\n    The minimum value of x+y is A+B, maximum is B+C.\n\n    How to compute F(t) for t from A+B to B+C?\n\n    We can use two pointers or sliding window. Note that for a fixed x, y must be in [B, C] and x+y>t is equivalent to y>t-x.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use prefix sums.\n\n    But note: the ranges for x and y are contiguous. The set of pairs (x,y) forms a rectangle. The values of x+y form a contiguous set of integers? Not exactly, but we can use:\n\n    For a fixed t, the pairs (x,y) such that x+y=t are:\n\n        x from max(A, t-C) to min(B, t-B)   [because y=t-x must be in [B,C]]\n\n    Then, the number of pairs for a fixed t is: max(0, min(B, t-B) - max(A, t-C) + 1) if the interval is non-empty.\n\n    However, note: we can also compute the entire array F(t) by:\n\n        Let L = A+B, R = B+C.\n        Then for t from L to R:\n            low_x = max(A, t-C)\n            high_x = min(B, t-B)\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                F(t) = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                F(t) = 0\n\n    Then, we can build an array F of length (R-L+1) (indexed from 0 to (R-L)) and then compute a suffix sum array G for F.\n\n    Then, for a fixed z, the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y>z is:\n\n        If z < L: then all pairs (since all pairs have x+y>=L) -> then we use the entire total pairs.\n        But note: our z starts from C (which is at least B, and note that the smallest x+y is A+B, and we know A<=B<=C so A+B <= B+C, and C>=B>=A, but note: z starts at C and the minimum x+y is A+B, which might be less than C? Actually, we have A<=B<=C, so A+B could be as small as 2*A (if A=B) and as large as A+B (if A<B). But note: we are going to consider z from C to D, and the condition x+y>z requires that x+y>z>=C. \n\n    Actually, we can restrict t from max(L, z+1) to R.\n\n    So, let G(t) = F(t) for t from L to R, and 0 otherwise.\n\n    Then, we want S(z) = sum_{t=z+1}^{R} F(t) = (suffix sum of F from t=z+1 to R)\n\n    Then, the answer is: \n        ans = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            if z+1 <= R:\n                ans += suffix[z+1]   # where suffix[i] = sum_{t=i}^{R} F(t)\n            else:\n                # if z+1 > R, then no pair satisfies x+y>z, so skip\n                continue\n\n    But note: we must consider that the pairs (x,y) are independent of z, so we can precompute the suffix array for F.\n\n 2. However, note: the total pairs (without condition) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). And we can also compute the condition x+y>z by:\n\n        pairs(x,y) such that x+y>z = total_pairs - pairs(x+y<=z)\n\n    But we are computing the condition via the positive side (x+y>z) by the suffix array.\n\n 3. But wait: what if z is very large? Then the condition x+y>z might not hold for any pair. Our method with F(t) and suffix array naturally handles that.\n\n 4. However, we must note: the minimum x+y is A+B, so if z >= A+B, then we can still have some pairs (if z < B+C). But if z >= B+C, then no pair (x,y) satisfies x+y>z (because the maximum x+y is B+C). \n\n    Actually, the condition for a fixed z is: x+y>z. The maximum x+y is B+C, so if z >= B+C, then no pair exists.\n\n 5. Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute the array F for t from L=A+B to R=B+C.\n\n        Let L0 = A+B, R0 = B+C.\n\n        We'll create an array `freq` of zeros with length (R0 - L0 + 2) (indexed from 0 to (R0-L0+1)).\n\n        Then for t from L0 to R0:\n            low_x = max(A, t - C)\n            high_x = min(B, t - B)\n\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                freq[t - L0] = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                freq[t - L0] = 0\n\n    Step 2: Build a suffix sum array `suffix` for `freq` from t=L0 to t=R0.\n\n        Let `suffix[i]` = sum_{j=i}^{R0-L0} freq[j]   (where j indexes from 0 to R0-L0, and i corresponds to t = i+L0)\n\n        Alternatively, we can define an array `F_arr` for t from L0 to R0, then compute the suffix sum for indices from L0 to R0.\n\n        Then, for a given z (from C to D), we want:\n\n            start_t = z+1\n            end_t = R0\n\n            If start_t > end_t, then the number of pairs is 0.\n\n            Otherwise, we need to sum F_arr for t from start_t to end_t.\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            suffix_sum[i] = F(i) + F(i+1) + ... + F(R0)\n\n        Then the number of pairs for a fixed z is:\n\n            if z+1 <= R0:\n                num_pairs = suffix_sum[z+1]   # but note: our F_arr is defined for t from L0 to R0, and we built the suffix array from L0 to R0.\n\n        However, note: our `freq` array is indexed by t-L0. So we need to map t to index.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build an array `suffix` for t from 0 to R0 (with zeros for t below L0 and above R0) but we don't need to.\n\n    Step 3: Iterate z from C to D (inclusive) and for each z:\n\n        if z+1 <= R0:\n            ans += suffix_sum[z+1]\n        else:\n            # nothing to add\n            pass\n\n    But note: we have to account for the fact that the pairs (x,y) must also satisfy the original ranges. We did that in F_arr.\n\n 6. However, note: the problem does not require that x,y,z are distinct? It says integer sides, so they can repeat. The triangle condition is just x+y>z.\n\n 7. But wait: what if the condition x+y>z is automatically satisfied for some z? \n\n    Example: In the first example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n    Then, we have x in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,4].\n\n    Pairs (x,y): \n        (1,2): 3\n        (1,3): 4\n        (2,2): 4\n        (2,3): 5\n\n    Then, for z=3: we require x+y>3 -> pairs (1,3):4>3, (2,2):4>3, (2,3):5>3 -> 3 pairs? But the example says 4 triangles.\n\n    Wait, the example output is 4. Let me list the triangles:\n\n        (1,3,3): 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> valid.\n        (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> valid.\n        (2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3 -> valid.\n        (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> valid.\n\n    So for z=3: 3 pairs (for z=3 we have 3 triangles: the first three) and for z=4: 1 triangle (the last one). Total 4.\n\n    In our method, for z=3: we count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>3. The pairs are (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) -> 3 pairs. Then for z=4: pairs (x,y) such that x+y>4 -> only (2,3) -> 1 pair. So total 4.\n\n    But wait: the example has two different z values: 3 and 4. \n\n    However, note: the example input is \"1 2 3 4\", and the output is 4.\n\n    So our method is:\n\n        Precompute F_arr for t from 3 to 5 (since A+B=1+2=3, B+C=2+3=5).\n\n        t=3: low_x = max(1,3-3)=max(1,0)=1, high_x=min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> F(3)=1 (the pair (1,2))\n        t=4: low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1, high_x=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> F(4)=2 (pairs (1,3) and (2,2))\n        t=5: low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, high_x=min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2 -> F(5)=1 (pair (2,3))\n\n        Then, we build the suffix sum for t from 3 to 5:\n\n            suffix_sum[3] = F(3)+F(4)+F(5) = 1+2+1 = 4\n            suffix_sum[4] = F(4)+F(5) = 3\n            suffix_sum[5] = F(5) = 1\n\n        Now, for z=3: we need t from 4 to 5 -> so we use suffix_sum[4] = 3? But wait, we defined suffix_sum[i] as the sum from t=i to R0.\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n\n            Let `suffix` be an array such that suffix[t] = sum_{i=t}^{R0} F(i)\n\n        Then for z, we want the sum for t from z+1 to R0.\n\n        So for z=3: t from 4 to 5 -> suffix[4] = F(4)+F(5)=3.\n        for z=4: t from 5 to 5 -> suffix[5]=1.\n\n        Then total = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n        But wait, in our F_arr, the pair (1,2) gives t=3, but we don't use t=3 for any z? Because z starts at 3 and we require t>z, so for z=3 we use t>=4.\n\n        So our method is correct.\n\n 8. However, note that the ranges for x and y are fixed, but the condition for x and y is independent of z. We are counting the same set of pairs (x,y) for each z.\n\n 9.

Also, A+B might be less than C? \n\n            Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4: T_min=3, and z starts at 3. Then for z=3, we use t from 4 to 5 (if 4 is between T_min and T_max).\n\n            However, we can simply do:\n\n                total_pairs = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)   # This is the total pairs (x,y) without condition.\n\n                But we don't need that.\n\n            We can build an array `suffix_sum` for t from T_min to T_max, and then for t not in [T_min, T_max] we return 0.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                Let `suffix` = [0]*(T_max-T_min+2)   # index from T_min to T_max, and we index by t.\n\n                We can create an array `arr` for t from T_min to T_max: arr[t-T_min] = F(t)\n\n                Then, we can compute:\n\n                    suffix[T_max] = arr[T_max-T_min]\n                    for t from T_max-1 down to T_min:\n                        suffix[t] = arr[t-T_min] + suffix[t+1]\n\n                Then, for a given z, we look at t0 = z+1.\n\n                Then, if t0 < T_min: use total_sum = suffix[T_min] (but we don't need to, because we can compute the entire array and then use the suffix array starting from T_min)\n\n            Actually, we can avoid building an array for every t from T_min to T_max by using:\n\n                Let `suffix` be an array of length (T_max-T_min+1) for t from T_min to T_max.\n\n                Then, for a given z, we need the sum from t=z+1 to T_max.\n\n                We can map t to an index: idx = t - T_min.\n\n                Then, if z+1 < T_min: then the entire sum is suffix[0] (which is the whole array).\n                if z+1 > T_max: then 0.\n                if T_min <= z+1 <= T_max: then we use the suffix array starting at index (z+1 - T_min) and go to the end.\n\n            However, we built the suffix array for t from T_min to T_max, so:\n\n                Let `suffix_arr` = [0]*(T_max-T_min+2)   # we'll index from 0 to T_max-T_min (the length is T_max-T_min+1)\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    # Build an array `F_vals` for t from T_min to T_max (length = T_max-T_min+1)\n                    F_vals = [0]*(T_max-T_min+1)\n                    for t_val in range(T_min, T_max+1):\n                        # compute F_vals[t_val - T_min] as above\n\n                    Then, build suffix_arr from the last element:\n\n                    suffix_arr[T_max-T_min] = F_vals[T_max-T_min]\n                    for i in range(T_max-T_min-1, T_min-1, -1):   # i from T_max-T_min-1 down to 0\n                        suffix_arr[i] = F_vals[i] + suffix_arr[i+1]\n\n                Then, for a given z:\n\n                    t0 = z+1\n\n                    if t0 < T_min:\n                        count_z = suffix_arr[0]   # because suffix_arr[0] is the entire sum from T_min to T_max\n                    elif t0 > T_max:\n                        count_z = 0\n                    else:\n                        idx = t0 - T_min\n                        count_z = suffix_arr[idx]   # because suffix_arr[idx] is the sum from t0 to T_max\n\n            But wait: our suffix_arr[i] is defined as the sum from F_vals[i] (which corresponds to t=T_min+i) to the end.\n\n            Actually, we built:\n\n                suffix_arr[i] = F_vals[i] + suffix_arr[i+1]   (for i from T_max-T_min-1 down to 0)\n\n            Then, the element at i is the sum from index i to the end (in F_vals). So that's correct.\n\n 10. However, note: the entire array F_vals is for t from T_min to T_max, and we are storing the frequency for each t.\n\n 11. But note: the range of t is from A+B to B+C, and we are iterating t from L0 to R0.\n\n 12. But there is a catch: the computation of F(t) for each t from L0 to R0 must be efficient. We are doing (R0-L0+1) iterations, and R0-L0+1 = (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1, which is up to 500000 (since A,B,C,D <=500000, then C-A can be up to 500000). So that's acceptable.\n\n 13. Code:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n        L0 = A+B\n        R0 = B+C\n\n        # If there are no pairs (x,y) then the entire calculation is 0.\n        if L0 > R0:\n            # Actually, this cannot happen because A<=B<=C, so A+B <= B+B <= B+C (since C>=B).

The minimum x+y is 1+2=3, so for z=2 (which is less than 3) we should count the entire F_vals (because x+y>=3>2 -> always true).

So that's correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the triangle also requires that the side z is at least C (which is 2).

The sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are constrained within specific ranges: \\(x\\) from \\([A, B]\\), \\(y\\) from \\([B, C]\\), and \\(z\\) from \\([C, D]\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each possible \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), we need to count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This can be rephrased as counting pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\geq z + 1\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: We first compute a frequency array `F_vals` where each entry `F_vals[t]` represents the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = t\\). This is done by iterating over all possible sums \\(t\\) from \\(A + B\\) (minimum sum) to \\(B + C\\) (maximum sum).\n   - **Suffix Sum Array**: Using the frequency array, we construct a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of frequencies from \\(i\\) to \\(B + C\\). This allows us to quickly compute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for any given \\(z\\) by summing frequencies from \\(z + 1\\) to \\(B + C\\).\n\n4. **Query Processing**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), we use the suffix sum array to determine the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs. If \\(z + 1\\) is beyond the maximum sum \\(B + C\\), no pairs exist; if \\(z + 1\\) is below the minimum sum \\(A + B\\), all pairs are valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    L0 = A + B\n    R0 = B + C\n    \n    if L0 > R0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n_t = R0 - L0 + 1\n    F_vals = [0] * n_t\n    \n    for t_val in range(L0, R0 + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, t_val - C)\n        high_x = min(B, t_val - B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            idx = t_val - L0\n            F_vals[idx] = high_x - low_x + 1\n            \n    suff = [0] * n_t\n    if n_t > 0:\n        suff[-1] = F_vals[-1]\n        for i in range(n_t - 2, -1, -1):\n            suff[i] = F_vals[i] + suff[i + 1]\n            \n    total_triangles = 0\n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        t_min_for_z = z_val + 1\n        if t_min_for_z > R0:\n            count_z = 0\n        elif t_min_for_z < L0:\n            count_z = suff[0]\n        else:\n            start_index = t_min_for_z - L0\n            if start_index >= n_t:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                count_z = suff[start_index]\n        total_triangles += count_z\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Initial Checks**: The minimum possible sum of sides \\(x + y\\) is \\(A + B\\), and the maximum is \\(B + C\\). If \\(A + B > B + C\\), there are no valid triangles, so the answer is 0.\n\n3. **Frequency Array Construction**: For each possible sum \\(t\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), compute how many pairs \\((x, y)\\) sum to \\(t\\). This involves checking the valid range for \\(x\\) (and thus \\(y = t - x\\)) within the given constraints.\n\n4. **Suffix Sum Array**: This array helps in quickly summing the number of valid pairs for any \\(z\\) by providing the cumulative count of pairs from a given sum to the maximum sum.\n\n5. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), determine the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs by checking the suffix sum starting from \\(z + 1\\). Sum these counts to get the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using mathematical insights and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
