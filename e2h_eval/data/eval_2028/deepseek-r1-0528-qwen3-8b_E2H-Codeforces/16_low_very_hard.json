Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road (a line). However, note that the movement condition: \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\" means we are allowed to cross an entire road (which is an infinite line) in one step. But note: two blocks that only meet at a single point (intersection) are not adjacent by a nonzero border.\n\n The problem then reduces to: how many roads must be crossed to get from home to university?\n\n However, note that the roads divide the plane. We can think of each road as a linear constraint. The entire plane is divided by n lines. The home and university are in some regions (blocks). We need to count the minimum number of roads that separate them? But note: we are allowed to cross one road at a time, and each crossing changes the region (block) we are in.\n\n Actually, the problem is equivalent to: consider the set of roads that separate home and university. Each road that separates them must be crossed. Moreover, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them? But wait, note the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0   -> y = 0 (the x-axis)\n      1 0 0   -> x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n   Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1) are in the same quadrant (first quadrant and third quadrant). To go from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must cross both the x-axis and the y-axis. However, note that they are separated by two lines. But the example output is 2.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that we can move from one block to another only if they share a nonzero border. So we cannot cross two roads at once (unless they intersect at a point, but then we would have to cross two borders? Actually, no: when two roads intersect, we can cross one at a time.\n\n   However, note that the two roads (x=0 and y=0) intersect at (0,0). The regions are the four quadrants. To go from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must leave the first quadrant. We can either go via the positive x-axis or the positive y-axis? Actually, no: we must cross two lines. But note: the problem says the step is defined by moving from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. The common borders are the segments of the roads. \n\n   How do we model this? We can consider that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie on opposite sides of a road if the sign of (aix1 + biy1 + ci) and (aix2 + biy2 + ci) are different. Then, to go from home to university, we must cross every road that separates them (i.e., for which the signs differ). And note: we can cross multiple roads at an intersection (so we don't have to worry about crossing two at the same time because the step definition is per road).\n\n   However, here's the catch: the problem does not require us to count the number of roads that separate the two points. Why? Because if two roads are crossed consecutively at an intersection, then we can consider that we did two steps (each crossing one road). But note: the minimal steps might be the number of separating roads? Because each step crosses one road.\n\n   But wait: what if two separating roads do not intersect? Actually, in a plane, two distinct lines either intersect or are parallel. If they are parallel, then we must cross each one separately. If they intersect, we can cross one and then the other at the same point (but still two steps). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not say that we have to cross the roads in any particular order, and we are allowed to cross one road at a time. So the answer should be the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Let me check with the second example:\n\n   Example 2:\n      Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0   -> x = 0\n        0 1 0   -> y = 0\n        1 1 -3  -> x + y - 3 = 0\n\n      Now, let's check the third road: x+y-3=0. \n        For (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n        For (-1,-1): -1-1-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such separating roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move between the two blocks.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, this road must be crossed at least once. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each road, evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(aix + biy + ci\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road is counted as a separator.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        \n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, the code checks the sign of the linear equation \\(aix + biy + ci\\) evaluated at both home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, it indicates that the road separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties of lines and point classification to determine the solution with optimal performance.",
