There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming with state (position, current height) but the restrictions might require knowing the maximum in intervals.\n\n However, note: There are up to 50 restrictions. Each restriction is a constraint on an interval [l_i, r_i] that the maximum height must be <= x_i.\n\n We cannot simply assign each house a value independently because of the constraints.\n\n Idea:\n 1. Preprocess the restrictions to find for each position i (from 1 to n) the minimum allowed maximum value in any interval that covers i.\n    Actually, we can define an array `min_constraint` for each position i: the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover i.\n\n    But note: It might be that there are multiple restrictions and we have to satisfy all. For a given position i, we must have the height <= the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include i.\n\n    However, wait: Consider two restrictions: \n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,4] with x=3\n    Then for position 2: the constraints from the two restrictions are 5 and 3 -> so the house at 2 must be <=3.\n\n    So for each position i, let `max_height[i]` = min{ x_j | for every restriction j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }\n\n    But note: if there is no restriction covering i, then the maximum height is just h (the global maximum).\n\n 2. Now, we have for each position i, a maximum allowed height: `allowed[i] = min(current_max, h)` where current_max is the minimum x from the restrictions that cover i, or if none, then h.\n\n 3. However, note: the restrictions are not independent. A restriction says \"the tallest house in the interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\". \n    This implies that in the entire interval, no house can exceed x_i. Therefore, the condition for a house at i is that it must be <= the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover i.\n\n    But also, even if we set the house at i to the maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover i, we must ensure that no other restriction is violated.\n\n    However, consider: if we set each house to the minimum allowed by the restrictions that cover it (or perhaps the maximum allowed value that doesn't break other constraints) then we might get a solution.\n\n    But note: the profit function is the square of the height. The square is a convex function, so we want to set each house as high as possible without violating the restrictions.\n\n 4. Therefore, for each position i, the maximum height we can assign is `allowed[i]` (which we defined above). However, wait: what if there is a restriction that does not cover i, but forces a lower maximum in an overlapping interval? \n\n    Actually, our `allowed[i]` is defined as the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover i. This is necessary because if there is a restriction that says the entire interval including i must be <= x_i, then we cannot exceed that. \n\n    But note: if two restrictions overlap, the more restrictive one (smaller x_i) will be taken.\n\n 5. However, there is a catch: the same house might be constrained by multiple restrictions, and the condition for a restriction is that the entire interval must have max <= x_i. Therefore, the house at i must be <= allowed[i] (as defined above). \n\n    But is that sufficient? Yes, because if we set every house to at most allowed[i], then for a given restriction j (covering [l_j, r_j]), the maximum height in that interval is at most the minimum x_i that applies to the interval (which is the minimum x_i over all restrictions that cover the interval, but note: the restrictions are independent). However, note that we defined `allowed[i]` for each i as the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover i. Then, in the interval [l_j, r_j], the maximum height will be at most the maximum of the `allowed[i]` for i in [l_j, r_j]. But wait, that might be higher than x_j.\n\n    Let me clarify: \n        Consider restriction j: [l_j, r_j] with x_j. We must have that the entire interval's max <= x_j. \n        But if we set each house i to allowed[i] (which is the minimum x_i of all restrictions covering i), then for the interval [l_j, r_j], the maximum allowed[i] for i in [l_j, r_j] must be <= x_j. \n\n    However, note: the restriction j requires that no house in [l_j, r_j] exceeds x_j. But if there is a house i in [l_j, r_j] that has a constraint (from some other restriction) that is less than x_j, then we set it to that lower value. But what if there is no other restriction that forces a lower value? Then we set it to x_j. \n\n    But note: our definition of allowed[i] for i in [l_j, r_j] is the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover i. This includes restriction j (since i is in [l_j, r_j]) so allowed[i] <= x_j. Therefore, the maximum height in the interval [l_j, r_j] would be at most the maximum allowed[i] for i in [l_j, r_j] and since each allowed[i] <= x_j, then the entire interval is <= x_j.\n\n    Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n 6. Then the problem reduces to: we have an array of maximum heights allowed at each position (each between 0 and h), and we can choose a nonnegative integer for each house (not exceeding the allowed maximum) and we wish to maximize the sum of squares.\n\n    This is separable and convex. The optimal for each house is to set it to the maximum allowed value (because the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers). \n\n    Therefore, the maximum profit is the sum over i from 1 to n of (allowed[i])**2.\n\n 7. But wait: let's check with the example:\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: n=3, h=3, m=3, restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        For position 1: only restriction [1,1,1] -> allowed[1] = 1.\n        For position 2: only restriction [2,2,3] -> allowed[2] = 3.\n        For position 3: only restriction [3,3,2] -> allowed[3] = 2.\n\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14. -> matches.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: n=4, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n        Position 1: no restriction -> allowed[1] = 10.\n        Position 2: covered by [2,3,8] -> allowed[2] = 8.\n        Position 3: covered by [2,3,8] and [3,4,7] -> allowed[3] = min(8,7)=7.\n        Position 4: covered by [3,4,7] -> allowed[4] = 7.\n\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. -> matches.\n\n 8. However, wait: what if there is a restriction that doesn't cover a particular house, but the house is still forced by another restriction to be low? Our method already takes the minimum of all restrictions that cover the house.\n\n 9. Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, h, m.\n    Step 2: Initialize an array `allowed` of length n (for indices 0 to n-1) with zeros, but note: initially, without any restrictions, the maximum is h. So set `allowed[i] = h` for all i.\n\n    Step 3: For each of the m restrictions (l, r, x):\n            For each index i from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) in the array (i.e., positions l to r), set \n                allowed[i] = min(allowed[i], x)\n\n    Step 4: Then the answer is the sum of (a**2) for a in allowed.\n\n 10. But wait: is that correct? Consider a house that is covered by multiple restrictions, we take the minimum x from those restrictions. And then we set the house to that minimum x (because we want the highest allowed by the most restrictive constraint). And then the square.\n\n 11. However, note: the problem says that the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_i. If we set each house to the minimum x_i that covers it, then indeed the tallest house in any interval is at most the maximum of these minimums. But note: the condition for the interval is that the tallest house in that interval must be <= x_i. In our setting, the house that is the tallest in the interval might be set to a value that is the minimum x_i from the restrictions that cover that house, and that minimum x_i might be lower than x_i (the current restriction). \n\n    However, we have already taken into account all restrictions. The condition for the restriction j (with value x_j) is automatically satisfied because the house in the interval [l_j, r_j] is set to at most x_j (because x_j is one of the values considered in the allowed[i] for i in [l_j, r_j]). \n\n    But note: the house might be set to a value lower than x_j, which is acceptable. \n\n 12. Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n However, wait again: the problem statement says that the maximum height per spot is h. Our `allowed[i]` is the minimum between h and the restrictions? Actually, we set initially to h and then take the minimum with x (which is between 0 and h). So we don't need an extra min.\n\n 13. Code accordingly.\n\n But wait, what if a restriction has x_i greater than h? Actually, the input says 0<=x_i<=h, so we are safe.\n\n 14. However, note: the problem says the maximum height in a spot is h. So if a restriction says x_i > h, that wouldn't matter because we cannot exceed h. But the input ensures x_i<=h.\n\n 15. Therefore, the code is:\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n    allowed = [h] * n   # n houses, each initially can be up to h\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < allowed[i]:\n                allowed[i] = x\n\n    total = 0\n    for a in allowed:\n        total += a*a\n\n    print(total)\n\n 16. Let me test with the examples:\n\n    Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        allowed = [3,3,3] initially.\n        After first restriction: [1,3,3]\n        After second: [1,3,3] -> then [1,3,3] becomes [1,3,3] (second house: min(3,3)=3)\n        After third: [1,3,2]\n\n        Sum: 1+9+4=14 -> correct.\n\n    Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        allowed = [10,10,10,10]\n        First restriction [2,3,8]: update positions 1 to 2 (0-indexed: indices 1 and 2) -> [10,8,8,10]\n        Second restriction [3,4,7]: update positions 2 to 3 (0-indexed: indices 2 and 3) -> [10,8,7,7]\n\n        Sum: 10*10 + 8*8 + 7*7 + 7*7 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> correct.\n\n 17. However, wait: the problem statement says \"There are n spots available... and the maximum height of a house is h\", meaning that even without any restriction, we cannot exceed h. Our initial setting is h, so that's correct.\n\n 18. But note: what if there are no restrictions? Then the array remains [h]*n, and the profit is n*h^2.\n\n 19. This solution is O(m*n) which is acceptable since n, m <= 50.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative scenario. What if the same house is covered by many restrictions? We are iterating each restriction and updating each house in the interval. Since n, m <=50, worst-case 50*50=2500 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n 20. Submit this?\n\n But wait: consider the following example:\n\n    Input: \n        3 10 2\n        1 3 5\n        1 3 7\n\n    According to our method, the allowed for each house is min(5,7)=5. Then profit = 3 * 25 = 75.\n\n    Is that correct? The first restriction says the entire street must have max<=5, and the second says max<=7. The stricter one is 5, so we set all houses to 5. Then the condition for the second restriction is satisfied (max=5<=7). Correct.\n\n Another example:\n\n    Input:\n        3 10 2\n        1 2 5\n        2 3 7\n\n    Then:\n        House0: covered by [1,2] -> allowed[0]=min(10,5)=5.\n        House1: covered by both -> allowed[1]=min(5,7)=5.\n        House2: covered by [2,3] -> allowed[2]=min(10,7)=7.\n\n        Profit = 5^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 25+25+49=99.\n\n    Check the restrictions:\n        Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(5,5)=5 <=5 -> ok.\n        Restriction2: [2,3] -> max(5,7)=7 <=7 -> ok.\n\n    But wait, what if we try to set house2 to 6? Then the second restriction would require that the entire [2,3] has max<=7, and 6<=7 is ok. And house1 is 5, so the first restriction is still ok. Then profit would be 5^2+5^2+6^2=25+25+36=86, which is less than 99. So 99 is better.\n\n    However, note: the square function is increasing, so we want the highest allowed value. The allowed value for house2 is 7, so we set it to 7. That gives 49, which is the maximum.\n\n    But wait: why is house1 set to 5? Because the first restriction says the entire [1,2] must be <=5, so house1 must be <=5. Then we set it to 5.\n\n    So the solution is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if the restrictions are not independent and we can sometimes set a house to a higher value than the minimum of the restrictions that cover it, as long as the overall interval conditions are satisfied? \n\n    Actually, the condition for a restriction is that the entire interval must have max <= x_i. The way we set the house at i is to the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover i. But note: the condition for the entire interval is automatically satisfied if every house is set to at most the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover it? \n\n    Let me think: \n        Suppose we have two restrictions: \n            R1: [1,3] x=5\n            R2: [2,4] x=7\n\n        Then for house1: only R1 -> allowed=5.\n        House2: both -> allowed=5.\n        House3: both -> allowed=5.\n        House4: only R2 -> allowed=7.\n\n        Now, if we set house4 to 7, then the entire interval for R2 is [2,4] with heights [5,5,5,7] -> the max is 7 which is <=7, so ok.\n\n        But note: the condition for R1 is that the entire [1,3] must be <=5. We set houses1,2,3 to 5, so that's ok.\n\n    Now, what if we set house4 to 6? Then the profit for house4 is 36, which is less than 49 (if set to 7). So we prefer 7.\n\n    But what if we set house3 to 6? Then the condition for R1: [1,3] has max=6 (since house3 is 6) which violates R1 (which requires <=5). So we cannot do that.\n\n    Therefore, the assignment we did is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we set a house to a value lower than the minimum x_i that covers it? Then the profit is lower. Since the square function is increasing, we always want to set the house to the maximum allowed, which is the minimum x_i that covers it.\n\n 21. Therefore, the code is:\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n    # Initialize allowed array with h for each house\n    allowed = [h] * n\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n        # Convert to 0-indexed: the interval [l, r] becomes [l-1, r-1]\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < allowed[i]:\n                allowed[i] = x\n\n    total_profit = 0\n    for a in allowed:\n        total_profit += a * a\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n 22. But wait, the example input format: \n        The first line: n, h, m\n        Then m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\n 23. However, the provided example input is given as a list of strings. But in the problem, the input is standard.\n\n 24. Let me run the provided example:\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        We read: n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Then three lines: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        Our code produces 14.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        Our code produces 262.\n\n 25. But wait, there is a problem: the above reasoning relies on the fact that the condition for each restriction is satisfied if we set each house to at most the minimum x_i that covers it. However, consider a different scenario:\n\n    Restriction: [1,3] with x=5, and another restriction: [1,2] with x=10.\n\n    Then for house1 and house2: the minimum x_i is min(5,10)=5.\n    For house3: only the first restriction, so 5.\n\n    Then we set all houses to 5. \n\n    Now, check the second restriction [1,2]: the maximum is 5<=10 -> ok.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n 26. Another scenario: two restrictions that are not nested:\n\n    Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n    Restriction2: [2,4] with x=10\n\n    Then:\n        house1: 5\n        house2: min(5,10)=5\n        house3: min(5,10)=5\n        house4: 10\n\n    Check restriction1: [1,3] -> max=5<=5 -> ok.\n    Check restriction2: [2,4] -> max(5,10)=10<=10 -> ok.\n\n 27. However, wait: what if the restrictions are conflicting in a way that the maximum value for a house is forced to be lower than the maximum of the allowed[i]? \n\n    Actually, the condition for a house is that it must be <= the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover it. So we are already taking the minimum. \n\n 28. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"The tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". \n\n    In our assignment, we set each house i to a value a_i (at most the minimum x_i that covers it). Then the tallest house in the interval [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of {a_j for j from l_i to r_i}. \n\n    However, note: for j in [l_i, r_i], we have a_j <= (the minimum x_k for k covering j) and note that the restriction i covers j (since j is in [l_i, r_i]) so the minimum x_k for k covering j is at most x_i. Therefore, a_j <= x_i for every j in [l_i, r_i]. So the tallest house is at most x_i.\n\n    Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n 29. Conclusion: the code is as above.\n\n However, wait: the problem states that the maximum height per spot is h. Our initial allowed[i] is h, and then we reduce by the restrictions. This is consistent.\n\n 30. But note: the problem says the height can be between 0 and h. We are setting each house to the minimum x_i (which is at least 0) and at most h. So we are within the bounds.\n\n 31. However, note: we are not considering the possibility that a house might be set to a value lower than the minimum x_i that covers it. But since the square function is increasing, we set to the maximum allowed, which is the minimum x_i.\n\n 32. One more edge: if a restriction has x_i=0, then the house must be 0. Then the profit is 0.\n\n 33. Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1: [1,1,0]\n        Then allowed[0]=0, profit=0.\n\n 34. Therefore, we output 0.\n\n 35. Code:\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n    allowed = [h] * n\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < allowed[i]:\n                allowed[i] = x\n\n    total = 0\n    for a in allowed:\n        total += a * a\n\n    print(total)\n\nLet me run the sample inputs.\n\nBut wait: the problem input is provided as a list of strings in the example, but the actual input is from stdin.\n\nWe'll write the code as above.\n\nHowever, note: the example input is given as a string, but when running the code we read from stdin.\n\nI'll submit the code.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the input format and the example input is given as a list of strings in the example. However, in competitive programming, we read from stdin.\n\nFinal code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is ensuring that all zoning restrictions are satisfied, which dictate that the tallest house in any specified interval must not exceed a given height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are met. Each restriction specifies that the maximum height in a particular interval must be at most a certain value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights, which encourages setting each house's height as high as possible without violating any restrictions.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is constrained by all restrictions that include that house. The most restrictive constraint (smallest maximum height) from all applicable restrictions determines the highest height the house can have. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an array `allowed` where each element is set to the global maximum height `h`.\n   - For each restriction, update the `allowed` array for all houses within the specified interval to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n   - The optimal height for each house is then the value stored in the `allowed` array, as this ensures compliance with all relevant restrictions while maximizing the profit due to the convex nature of the square function.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each house in its interval. With `m` restrictions and `n` houses, the complexity is O(m*n), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    allowed = [h] * n\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < allowed[i]:\n                allowed[i] = x\n    total = 0\n    for a in allowed:\n        total += a * a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the small constraints. The first three values are the number of spots `n`, the global maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `allowed` is initialized with each element set to `h`, representing the maximum height each house can have without any restrictions.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the `allowed` array for all houses within the specified interval `[l, r]` to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height `x`. This ensures that all restrictions are incorporated into the allowable heights.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the heights in the `allowed` array. The result is printed as the maximum achievable profit.\n\nThis approach efficiently incorporates all constraints and leverages the properties of the square function to maximize profit while adhering to the zoning restrictions.",
