For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Create a list or dictionary mapping each note to a semitone index.\n    Let's define the order: \n        C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5, F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11\n\n 2. But note: the problem says that the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. This is because after E (which is 4) we go to F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), then C (0). So the distance from E to C is (0 - 4) mod 12? Actually, we can calculate the circular distance.\n\n However, the problem states: the distance from E to C is 8. That means if we have two notes x and y, the distance from x to y (if going upward) is (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but if negative we add 12 and then take modulus.\n\n But note: the example says \"between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning when going from E to C (which is lower in the next octave) we count 8 semitones. In our mapping, E is 4 and C is 0. The direct difference (0-4) is -4, but if we consider the circle, we can go forward: from E to F(5) is 1, then F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), and then C(0) is the next one. So from E to C going forward: (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8.\n\n So we can define a function to compute the distance from note a to note b (in semitones) as:\n   dist(a, b) = (b_index - a_index) % 12\n But wait, if we do (b_index - a_index) % 12, then from E(4) to C(0): (0-4)%12 = -4 %12 = 8 (if we use modulo arithmetic that gives positive). Similarly, from C(0) to E(4): (4-0)%12=4.\n\n However, note that the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So for a major chord, we need to find an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n   (Y - X) % 12 = 4 and (Z - Y) % 12 = 3, and then (Z - X) % 12 should be 7 (which is 4+3).\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the starting note. We have three notes. We can try all permutations and check if any permutation satisfies either:\n   Option 1: (4, 3) -> major\n   Option 2: (3, 4) -> minor\n\n However, note: the entire chord has to be contained in the circle. Since the chord has three distinct notes? Actually, the problem doesn't say they are distinct. But typically a triad has distinct notes. Also, the example \"C E G\" has distinct notes.\n\n But what if there are duplicate notes? Then we cannot form a chord with three distinct notes. According to the problem, a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the input is three space separated notes. It might have duplicates? The problem says \"exactly three notes\", but it doesn't specify distinct. However, the examples are distinct.\n\n Let's read the problem: \"the triplet 'C# B F' is minor\". So we assume three distinct notes.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (0-11). We have to handle both sharps and naturals. Note: the note list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n 2. Since the input may have three distinct notes, we can check for duplicates. But the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so duplicates would break the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Semitones**: Each note is mapped to a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note musical scale (e.g., C=0, C#=1, ..., B=10, H=11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance between them is calculated as the difference in their semitone values, adjusted modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: We generate all permutations of the three input notes and check if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord:\n   - **Major Chord**: The distances between the notes should be 4 semitones and then 3 semitones (totaling 7 semitones).\n   - **Minor Chord**: The distances should be 3 semitones and then 4 semitones (totaling 7 semitones).\n4. **Result Determination**: If a valid permutation is found for either major or minor, the corresponding result is printed. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    mapping = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        a, b, c = data\n    except:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        x = mapping[a]\n        y = mapping[b]\n        z = mapping[c]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    if len({x, y, z}) < 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    def get_distance(n1, n2):\n        diff = (n2 - n1) % 12\n        return diff if diff <= 6 else 12 - diff\n        \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations([x, y, z]):\n        d1 = get_distance(perm[0], perm[1])\n        d2 = get_distance(perm[1], perm[2])\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by creating a dictionary that maps each note to its corresponding semitone value (0 to 11). This helps in converting the input notes into numerical values for distance calculations.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into three parts. The code checks if there are exactly three distinct notes; otherwise, it classifies the chord as \"strange\".\n3. **Distance Function**: The `get_distance` function calculates the shortest distance between two notes in semitones, considering the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of the three input notes and checks each permutation to see if it meets the criteria for a major or minor chord. A major chord requires a 4-semitone followed by a 3-semitone interval, while a minor chord requires a 3-semitone followed by a 4-semitone interval.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including duplicate notes or invalid inputs.",
