There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament is arranged under a constraint: two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they've already played is at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the constraint might force a structure that is not strictly by rounds.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players required for the winner to play at least k games.\n\n How do we build the tournament for the winner to have k games?\n - The first game: the winner plays one game, then has 1 win.\n - Then, to have a second game, there must be another player that has played at most 1 game (so either 0 or 1). But note: the winner has played 1, so the other must have played 0 or 1. Since the other hasn't played any game (because the winner is the only one with 1 game) then the other must have played 0. So we need two players: the winner and one opponent. Then the winner wins again.\n\n However, the constraint says that the two players must have numbers of games differing by at most one. So in the next game, the winner has 2 wins, then the next opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins. But wait, we haven't provided more than two players? Actually, we have:\n\n Consider building a bracket that allows the winner to have k games. We can model it as a full binary tree? Not exactly, because the constraint is on the number of games played.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recurrence:\n\n Let a_k be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\n How does the tournament progress?\n - To have the winner play k games, we can break down the last two games (the final and the one before) or consider the entire path.\n\n Another idea: \n In order for the winner to play k games, the tournament must have at least a certain structure. We can consider that the winner must defeat k opponents. But these opponents can themselves have won some games.\n\n Note: The rule allows two players to play if the difference in the number of games is at most one. This means that the tournament can be structured in a way that groups players by the number of wins they have.\n\n We can also think of the problem as: what is the maximum k such that the winner can have k wins and the entire tournament (with n players) can be arranged to accommodate this?\n\n We can define:\n   Let F(k) = the minimum number of players needed for the winner to have k wins.\n\n How to compute F(k)?\n - For k=0: 1 player (the winner doesn't play any game, but then he is the winner without playing? Actually, the problem states that the tournament is knockout and the winner must win all their games. So if there is only one player, then the winner hasn't played any game? But the problem says \"games the winner can take part in\", so 0 games? However, the input n>=2.\n\n But note: the example input n=2 gives output 1.\n\n Actually, the tournament starts with n>=2. The winner must play at least one game.\n\n Base case: \n   k=1: the winner must defeat one player. Therefore, we need at least two players. So F(1)=2.\n\n How about k=2?\n   The winner defeats two players. But wait, after defeating the first, how does he defeat the second?\n   Option 1: He could face the second player directly. Then the second player must have 0 or 1 game. Since the winner has 1, the second must have 0 or 1. But if the second player hasn't played, then we have two players (the winner and the second) and the winner wins. But then the winner would have two games: one against the first and one against the second. However, the first game: the winner plays the first, wins. Then the winner plays the second, wins. But the rule says: two players can play if the number of games differs by at most one. In the second game, the winner has 1 game and the second has 0 -> difference is 1, which is allowed.\n\n   However, we need to account for the first opponent: the first opponent must have been defeated without playing any other game? Then the entire structure is: the winner beats A and the winner beats B. But then we have two byes? Or is there a way to have the two opponents have played each other? \n\n   Actually, we can have a three-player tournament for the winner to get two wins? \n   But wait, with three players: \n        Game 1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (now Player1 has 1 win, Player2 has 0 wins, Player3 has 0 wins)\n        Then, Player1 vs Player3: the rule requires that the difference between Player1's 1 and Player3's 0 is <=1 -> allowed.\n\n   So with 3 players, the winner can play 2 games. But note: the problem says the winner must win all their games. In a three-player tournament, the winner must play two games. \n\n   However, what if we have two players? Then the winner plays one game. What if we have four players?\n        We want to know if the winner can play more than two games.\n\n   For k=3: \n        We need the winner to have 3 wins. \n        The structure: \n          First, the winner plays one game (against someone). Now the winner has 1 win, and the opponent has 0 wins (if we assume that the opponent hasn't played any other game).\n          Then, to get the second win, the winner must play someone who has at most 1 win. The only other players are the ones that haven't played. But now we have to consider that we might have two other players that have not played. However, the rule also applies to the matches between the other two? \n\n        Actually, we can arrange the tournament as follows for four players (to maximize the winner's games):\n\n        We can have two initial games: \n          Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (Player1:1, Player2:0, Player3:0, Player4:0)\n          Now, we cannot have two matches at the same time? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the scheduling, but the constraint is only on the number of games played so far.\n\n        However, the rule says: two players can play only if the number of games they've played differs by at most one.\n\n        So after the first game, we have:\n          Player1: 1 game\n          Players 2,3,4: 0 games.\n\n        Then, we can have a match between two of the zeros? \n          But then the winner of that match (say Player3) would have 1 game, and then the next match between Player1 (1 game) and Player3 (1 game) is allowed.\n\n        Then, the winner (Player1) has two wins. Then to get a third win, we need to play against the remaining player (Player4, 0 games). But then the difference between Player1 (2 wins) and Player4 (0 wins) is 2 -> not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can schedule the matches differently.\n\n        Another arrangement for four players to get the winner three games? \n        It turns out that with four players, the winner can have at most two wins. \n\n        Example from the problem: \n          Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n\n        So what is the pattern?\n\n        Let's try to generalize:\n\n        We can model the tournament as having two types of \"slots\" for the winner's path: \n        - The winner must beat k opponents.\n        - Additionally, to set up the conditions (that the opponents can play according to the rule), we need to have a structure that allows the winner to accumulate k wins.\n\n        Consider the following: \n          In the winner's first win, we need 1 opponent (so total 2 players).\n          In the second win, we need one more opponent. But to have that opponent available, we can have two possibilities:\n            Option A: The opponent has 0 wins (then we don't need to arrange anything else for him).\n            Option B: The opponent has 1 win (then that opponent must have won one game against someone else).\n\n        However, note the rule: the winner's second game must be against an opponent that has either 0 or 1 wins. \n\n        But if the opponent has 1 win, then that opponent must have beaten someone. That someone must have been eliminated. So the total number of players is at least: the winner + the two opponents (one for the second win and one for the first win of the second opponent) plus the one that lost to the second opponent? \n\n        Actually, let's break down for k=2:\n          Winner (W) needs to play 2 games.\n\n          Option 1: \n            W beats A (0 games) -> then W has 1 win.\n            Then W beats B (0 games) -> then W has 2 wins. Total players: 3.\n\n          Option 2:\n            W beats A (0 games) -> then W has 1 win.\n            Then we have a preliminary game: A vs B? But wait, we cannot have A and B play because A has 1 game and B has 0 -> allowed. Then A wins (so A has 1 win). Then W (with 1 win) can play A (with 1 win) -> allowed. Then W wins again. Total players: 4 (W, A, B, and the one who lost to A, say C). But wait, we didn't use C? Actually, the game between A and B: one of them (A) is the one that then faces W. Then the fourth player is the one that lost to A? Then we have 4 players.\n\n          However, the problem says for n=4 the answer is 2. So even though we have 4 players, the winner can only play 2 games. But note: the example says \"player 1 can't play against player 4\" because after two wins, the winner has 2 games and the other players (who haven't played) have 0, which is a difference of 2.\n\n        So the structure must be such that the winner's path is built with the minimal number of players.\n\n        Let me define:\n          Let a_k be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\n        Then:\n          k=0: 1 player (the winner doesn't play, but we don't count that)\n          k=1: 2 players (W and one opponent)\n\n        For k=2: \n          Option 1: 3 players (W, A, B) -> W beats A, then W beats B.\n          Option 2: 4 players (W, A, B, C) -> W beats A, then A beats B, then W beats A (but then we have two wins for W). However, note that in the second game, the rule says that the two players (W and A) must have at most one game difference. At that time, W has 1 and A has 1 (because A beat B) -> so that's allowed.\n\n        But wait, the problem says that the winner must win all their games. So the winner must be the one who wins the final. However, in the Option 2 for k=2, the winner only plays two games: the first and the third. The second game is between A and B. So the winner's record is two wins.\n\n        However, the total players is 4. But we can achieve k=2 with 3 players. So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3.\n\n        Now, what is the minimal number of players for k=3?\n          We need the winner to have 3 wins.\n\n          We can build upon k=2: \n          - After two wins, the winner has 2 wins and the opponent in the second win has at most 1 win (actually, in the minimal structure for k=2, the opponent had 0 wins). Now, to get the third win, the next opponent must have at most 2 wins? But wait, the rule: the difference must be at most one. So the opponent must have 1 or 2 wins.\n\n          How to get an opponent with 2 wins? \n          We can have two possibilities for the opponent's wins:\n\n          Possibility 1: The opponent has 2 wins (then we need to simulate the opponent's two wins). Then the opponent must have beaten two players. But those two players are distinct from the ones the winner has beaten. Also, the winner has beaten two players, and the opponent has beaten two players, so total at least 5 players? (Winner, the two that the winner beat, and the two that the opponent beat, and the opponent) -> 5 players.\n\n          Possibility 2: The opponent has 1 win. Then the opponent must have beaten one player. Then we have the winner beating the opponent, so the opponent's one win is against someone. Then the total players: Winner, the two that the winner beat, the one that the opponent beat, and the opponent -> 5 players.\n\n          But wait, we can also use the same two players that the winner beat to form the opponent's win? No, because the two players the winner beat are already eliminated.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different structure:\n\n          Step-by-step for k=3:\n\n          We start with the winner (W). We need to set up two wins for the opponent (if we go for the opponent having 2 wins) or one win for the opponent (if we go for the opponent having 1 win).\n\n          Let's do the opponent having 1 win (which is simpler):\n\n          - First, W plays against A (0 wins) -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n          - Then, we have two other players: B and C.\n          - We can have a game between B and C: say B wins (B:1, C:0)\n          - Then, we can have W play against A (but A is already 0) or against B (B has 1). The rule: W has 1, so the opponent must have 0 or 1. We can choose B (1) or A (0). But if we choose A, then the opponent has 0, so the difference is 1 -> allowed. Then W beats A again? But wait, A is already eliminated. Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          Actually, we need to arrange the tournament so that the winner gets to play three times.\n\n          Another structure:\n\n          Round 1: \n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B:1, C:0)\n\n          Round 2:\n            Game3: W (1) vs B (1) -> W wins (W:2, B:1) [now the winner has two wins]\n            Then, we have two players left: the loser of the first round (A) and the loser of the second (C). But wait, we have two players: A and C, both with 0 wins. Now, to get a third win, W must play someone. But the rule: W has 2 wins, so the opponent must have 1 or 2 wins. But A and C have 0 -> difference 2, not allowed.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          Round 1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B:1, C:0)\n\n          Then, we can have a third game between A and C? \n            Then: A vs C -> say A wins (A:1, C:0)\n          Then, Round 2: W (1) vs B (1) -> W wins (W:2, B:1)\n          Then, we have two players: A (1) and C (0). Now, to get the third win, W must play A (since A has 1, which is within one of W's 2). Then W beats A (third win). \n\n          Total players: W, A, B, C -> 4 players. But wait, we have 4 players and the winner has 3 wins? \n\n          However, the problem says for n=10 the answer is 4. So we are looking for the maximum k such that the tournament with n players can be arranged so that the winner plays k games.\n\n          But note: the minimal number of players for k=3 is 4? Then for n=4, the maximum k is 3? But the example input n=4 gives output 2.\n\n          Wait, the example input n=4 gives output 2. So the above structure for n=4 (with 4 players) giving the winner 3 wins is not allowed? Why?\n\n          Let me check the rule for the third win: \n            Before the third win, the winner has 2 wins (from beating B and then A in the second win? Actually, let me recount:\n\n          Proposed structure for 4 players (n=4) to get 3 wins for the winner:\n\n          Step-by-step:\n\n          Initially: W, A, B, C.\n\n          Game1: W vs A -> W wins. Now W has 1 win, A has 0, B and C have 0.\n          Game2: B vs C -> B wins. Now B has 1, C has 0.\n          Game3: W vs B -> W wins. Now W has 2 wins, B has 1, and C has 0.\n          Game4: Now we have two players: A (0 wins) and C (0 wins). We can have A vs C, then A wins. Now A has 1 win, C has 0.\n          Game5: Then W (2 wins) vs A (1 win) -> W wins. Now W has 3 wins.\n\n          But wait, the problem says the tournament is knockout. In a knockout tournament, the total number of games is n-1. For 4 players, we should have 3 games. But here we have 5 games? That's not possible.\n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify the exact format (single elimination or ...) but the rule is about the number of games played by each. However, note that the tournament is knockout: once you lose, you leave. The winner must win all his games, and the others must lose at some point.\n\n          In a standard single elimination, 4 players require 3 games. But our structure used 5 games? That is because we are not following a fixed bracket. The rule allows for scheduling as long as the condition holds. But note: the condition is on the number of games played, so we can interleave the games arbitrarily.\n\n          However, the condition must hold at the time of the game. \n\n          But in our structure, the game5 is the fifth game, but then we have 5 games and 5 matches? That's not a valid knockout tournament because the total number of games is n-1 = 3. \n\n          Therefore, we must have exactly n-1 games. The winner's wins are the number of games he plays, and the total wins by all players must equal n-1 (each game produces one win). \n\n          So the winner's wins (k) plus the wins of the other players must sum to n-1.\n\n          Also, the winner must be the only one with k wins, and the rest must have less than k wins (because they lost at least once).\n\n          How to relate k and n?\n\n          We can use a recursive (or mathematical) approach.\n\n          Let f(k) be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\n          How to build f(k)?\n\n          Consider that the winner's k wins must be achieved against opponents. Each of these opponents may have come from a subtree. However, the rule constrains the number of games the opponent has played.\n\n          We can think: \n          - The winner's first win: the opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. But to minimize the total players, we want to use as few as possible. So we can have the opponent with 0 wins (then the opponent didn't play any other game). Then the next win: the opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. But if we use an opponent with 0 wins again, then we are using two players for two wins. But wait, we can also use an opponent that has 1 win (then that opponent must have beaten someone). \n\n          Actually, we can model the minimal number of players for the winner to have k wins as:\n\n          Let a_0 = 1 (base: the winner with 0 wins, but we don't count the winner as a player that loses, so we start with the winner and then add players for the wins and for the opponents' wins)\n\n          Alternatively, note:\n\n          In the winner's k wins, we can break the tournament into two parts: \n          - The winner's own k games.\n          - The rest of the tournament: which includes the k opponents and the players that the opponents defeated.\n\n          However, the rule imposes that the opponents can have at most one less or one more win than the winner at the time of the match.\n\n          There is a known combinatorial approach for similar problems (like CodeForces problems) where the maximum wins the champion can have is found by solving a recurrence:\n\n          Let g(0) = 1\n          Then, the minimal number of players for k wins is defined by:\n            f(0) = 1\n            f(1) = 2\n            For k>=2, we can have two cases for the last win: \n              Case 1: The last opponent has k-1 wins (then we need to account for the entire subtree that built that opponent having k-1 wins, which requires f(k-1) players, but note: the opponent is one of the players and the winner is separate). However, wait, the opponent is one player and the subtree for the opponent's k-1 wins requires f(k-1) players (including the opponent and his defeated opponents). But then the total players would be: 1 (the winner) + f(k-1) (the opponent and his subtree) ... but wait, the opponent is included in f(k-1). And then we must account for the previous k-1 wins of the winner? Actually, no, because the previous wins of the winner are independent.\n\n          Actually, we can use the following recurrence for the minimal number of players:\n\n          f(0) = 1\n          f(1) = 2\n          For k>=2, the minimal number of players is the sum of the minimal numbers for two subtrees: \n            One subtree for the last win (which requires f(k-1)) and one subtree for the wins that lead to the condition that the last opponent has at most k wins (actually, the rule says the last opponent must have k-1 or k wins, but we are minimizing the total players so we choose the minimal requirement).\n\n          However, note that the winner's k-th win must be against an opponent that has either k-1 or k-2 wins? Actually, the rule says the difference must be at most 1. So the last opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins (because the winner has k-1 wins at that moment). \n\n          Therefore, to minimize the total players, we can consider:\n\n          Option 1: The last opponent has k-1 wins. Then the opponent must have been built from a subtree of size f(k-1). Then the total players is: 1 (the winner) + f(k-1) (for the last opponent's subtree) + ... but wait, the winner's previous k-1 wins must be arranged with the remaining players. However, the entire tournament must have at least the players from the last opponent's subtree and the players from the winner's previous wins.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the recurrence:\n\n          f(k) = 1 + f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n\n          Why?\n          - The winner (1) \n          - The last win: we need an opponent that has k-1 wins, which requires a subtree of size f(k-1) (which includes the opponent and his defeated players). \n          - But wait, the winner's previous k-1 wins must be arranged in a way that the remaining players (excluding the last opponent's subtree) are enough to provide the conditions. Actually, the minimal structure for the winner to have k wins is to have two subtrees: one for the last win (opponent with k-1 wins) and one for the rest (the winner's previous wins). However, the entire structure is built by combining two tournaments: one that gives the opponent with k-1 wins and one that gives the winner's previous k-2 wins? \n\n          Let me check with k=2:\n            f(2) = 1 + f(1) + f(0) = 1+2+1 = 4.\n\n          But we know that k=2 can be done with 3 players. So that recurrence is too big.\n\n          Alternatively, consider:\n\n          The minimal number of players for the winner to have k wins is the smallest n such that we can represent the tournament as:\n\n          n = 1 + T, where T is the total number of players that are not the winner.\n\n          And the T players must be distributed in two groups:\n\n          Group1: the opponents that the winner beats (k opponents) and the players that are beaten by those opponents.\n\n          But the rule: when the winner beats an opponent, that opponent must have a certain number of wins.\n\n          We can also consider that the tournament can be broken down as:\n\n          - The winner must beat k opponents.\n          - Each opponent i must have a number of wins w_i (the number of games they won before losing to the winner) such that |w_i - (i-1)| <= 1, but actually the condition is applied at the time of the match.\n\n          However, a better known solution for similar problems (like CodeForces Round #FF, \"Tennis Championship\") uses:\n\n          Let f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, and then f(k) = 2 * f(k-1) + 1.\n\n          But wait, let me recall: \n\n          There is a problem (CodeForces) where the tournament is arranged so that the winner can have at most floor(log2(n)) wins? But the examples:\n\n          n=2 -> 1\n          n=3 -> 2\n          n=4 -> 2\n          n=10 -> 4\n\n          Let's see:\n\n          k=1: n=2 -> 1\n          k=2: n=3 or 4 -> 2\n          k=3: n=5,6,7,8 -> 3? But the example n=10 gives 4, so k=4.\n\n          How many players are required for the winner to have 4 wins?\n\n          We can use the recurrence: \n          f(0)=1, f(1)=2, then for k>=2, f(k)=f(k-1)+f(k-2)\n\n          Then:\n            f(0)=1\n            f(1)=2\n            f(2)=f(1)+f(0)=2+1=3\n            f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=3+2=5\n            f(4)=f(3)+f(2)=5+3=8\n            f(5)=8+5=13\n\n          Then, for k=1, we need 2 players -> n>=2\n          for k=2, we need 3 players -> n>=3\n          for k=3, we need 5 players -> n>=5\n          for k=4, we need 8 players -> n>=8\n\n          Now, the example: \n            n=2 -> k=1\n            n=3 -> k=2 (because 3>=3, so the minimal n for k=2 is 3, so n=3 gives k=2)\n            n=4 -> k=2 (because 4>=3, so k=2 is achievable, but k=3 requires 5, so maximum k for n=4 is 2)\n            n=10 -> k=4 (because 10>=8, so k=4 is achievable, and k=5 requires 13, so maximum k is 4)\n\n          This matches the examples: \n            Input 2 -> 1\n            Input 3 -> 2\n            Input 4 -> 2\n            Input 10 -> 4\n\n          So the recurrence is: \n            Let f(0)=1, f(1)=2, and for k>=2, f(k)=f(k-1)+f(k-2)\n\n          Then, the answer for n is the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          We are given n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10**18). We need to find the maximum k for which f(k) <= n.\n\n          But note: our recurrence f(k) is defined for k>=0, and we want the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n          However, note that the minimal number of players for k wins is f(k). Then the winner can play k games if and only if n >= f(k).\n\n          Then, the answer is the maximum k (starting from 0) such that f(k) <= n.\n\n          But note: k=0 -> f(0)=1, which is <= n (since n>=2). But the winner must play at least one game, so k>=1. However, the problem says the tournament has n>=2, so the minimal k is 1.\n\n          We can generate the sequence until we exceed n, and then the last k for which f(k)<=n is the answer.\n\n          However, n can be up to 10^18, so we cannot iterate until k is very large (but note the Fibonacci-like sequence grows exponentially: f(k) ~ phi^k / sqrt(5) (golden ratio), so k will be at most around 100.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Let k=0, a0=1, a1=2.\n          Then for k>=2, a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}\n\n          We want the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n          But note: the sequence:\n            k0: 1\n            k1: 2\n            k2: 3\n            k3: 5\n            k4: 8\n            k5: 13\n            k6: 21\n            k7: 34\n            k8: 55\n            k9: 89\n            k10: 144\n            ... until we exceed 10**18.\n\n          Since the growth is exponential, we can iterate k from 0 to about 100.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the winner can play k games, and the minimal number of players for k games is a_k. Then the maximum k is the largest integer such that a_k <= n.\n\n          But wait: the example n=2: \n            k0: 1<=2 -> yes\n            k1: 2<=2 -> yes\n            k2: 3<=2 -> no -> then maximum k is 1.\n\n          Example n=3:\n            k0: 1<=3 -> yes\n            k1: 2<=3 -> yes\n            k2: 3<=3 -> yes\n            k3: 5<=3 -> no -> maximum k is 2.\n\n          Example n=4:\n            k0: 1<=4 -> yes\n            k1: 2<=4 -> yes\n            k2: 3<=4 -> yes\n            k3: 5<=4 -> no -> maximum k is 2.\n\n          Example n=10:\n            k0: 1<=10 -> yes\n            k1: 2<=10 -> yes\n            k2: 3<=10 -> yes\n            k3: 5<=10 -> yes\n            k4: 8<=10 -> yes\n            k5: 13<=10 -> no -> maximum k is 4.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is k.\n\n          However, note: the problem states that the winner must win all their games, and the tournament is knockout. The minimal number of players for k wins is a_k, so if we have n>=a_k, then we can arrange the tournament so that the winner plays k games.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n          Initialize:\n            a0 = 1\n            a1 = 2\n            k = 0\n            We'll iterate k from 0 upwards until a_k > n.\n\n          But note: we are given n (a single integer). We want the maximum k (starting from 0) such that a_k <= n.\n\n          However, k=0 is always true (since n>=2, and a0=1<=2). But the problem says the tournament has n>=2, so the winner must play at least one game. But note: k=0 is the base case (no wins) and k=1 is the first win.\n\n          We are counting k as the number of wins (games the winner plays). So we want the maximum k (number of wins) that is allowed.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Read n.\n\n          If n==1: then answer 0 (but n>=2, so skip)\n          Else:\n            a0 = 1\n            a1 = 2\n            k = 1   # because k=0 is always allowed, but we are going to iterate and count the number of wins (k) from 1 upwards.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let k = 0\n          Let a_prev0 = 1   # a0\n          Let a_prev1 = 2   # a1\n\n          Then we want to find the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n          But note: we have two starting values. We can store the sequence in a list until the value exceeds n.\n\n          However, we only need the last two terms.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          k = 0: a0 = 1 -> valid, then k=1: a1=2 -> valid, then k=2: a2=3, k=3:5, etc.\n\n          We want to count the maximum k (which is the index in the sequence) such that a_k<=n.\n\n          But note: our sequence index k starts at 0.\n\n          However, the problem's k (wins) is the same as our index? \n          Our sequence: \n            index0: 1 -> corresponds to 0 wins? \n            But wait, the winner with 0 wins requires 1 player. However, the problem states that the tournament has at least 2 players. \n\n          But the question is: the winner's wins. The minimal tournament for the winner to have 0 wins is 1 player, but we have at least 2. \n\n          However, the problem says: \"two players can play only if ...\" and the tournament hasn't started. \n\n          We are interested in the maximum wins the winner can have. \n\n          The recurrence we built was for the minimal number of players to have the winner play k wins. \n\n          So the answer is the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n          But note: the example n=2: k=1 (wins) is allowed (f(1)=2<=2) and k=2 (f(2)=3>2) -> so answer=1.\n\n          However, the sequence we built:\n\n            k=0: 1\n            k=1: 2\n            k=2: 3\n            k=3: 5\n\n          And we want to return k (the number of wins) for the maximum k such that f(k)<=n.\n\n          But note: the problem says the winner's wins. The sequence k=0 corresponds to 0 wins, but that is not the winner we are talking about (the tournament hasn't started). \n\n          However, the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in. \n\n          In our recurrence, k=0: 0 wins, k=1: 1 win, k=2: 2 wins, etc.\n\n          So the answer is the k (the index) we found.\n\n          But wait, the example n=2: we found k=1 (wins) -> output 1, which is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we can iterate:\n\n          Let a0 = 1, a1 = 2.\n          Let k = 0 (meaning 0 wins) -> but we are going to count the wins.\n\n          Actually, we want to count the wins (k) from 0 upwards. However, the problem's examples:\n\n            n=2 -> k=1 (win)\n            n=3 -> k=2 (wins)\n            n=4 -> k=2 (wins)\n\n          So the answer is the k (the index) we found, but note: the index k in our sequence is the number of wins.\n\n          However, wait: \n            Our sequence:\n                k=0: 0 wins -> minimal players 1\n                k=1: 1 win -> minimal players 2\n                k=2: 2 wins -> minimal players 3\n                k=3: 3 wins -> minimal players 5\n\n          Then, for n=2, we allow k=0 and k=1. The maximum k is 1 -> output 1.\n\n          But note: the problem says the tournament has n>=2, so the minimal",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their number of games played is at most one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the winner must win all their games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for `k` wins is given by the recurrence relation:\n   - \\( f(0) = 1 \\)\n   - \\( f(1) = 2 \\)\n   - For \\( k \\geq 2 \\), \\( f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) \\)\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem reduces to finding the largest integer `k` such that \\( f(k) \\leq n \\). This is because the sequence grows exponentially, ensuring that even for very large `n` (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)), the solution can be found efficiently by iterating through the sequence until the value exceeds `n`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate the sequence values iteratively, starting from the base cases, and count how many terms (wins) can be accommodated within `n` players. The last valid term before the sequence exceeds `n` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The sequence grows exponentially (similar to the Fibonacci sequence), so the number of iterations required is logarithmic in `n`. For \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), the loop runs approximately 90 times, making the solution efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a0 = 1\n    a1 = 2\n    count = 0\n    \n    if n >= a0:\n        count += 1\n    if n >= a1:\n        count += 1\n        \n    while True:\n        next_val = a0 + a1\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        count += 1\n        a0 = a1\n        a1 = next_val\n        \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the output is 0 since a tournament requires at least 2 players.\n3. **Sequence Generation**: The code initializes the first two terms of the sequence (`a0 = 1` for 0 wins, `a1 = 2` for 1 win). It then checks how many terms of the sequence are less than or equal to `n`.\n4. **Iteration**: Using a loop, the code generates each subsequent term by summing the previous two terms. For each valid term (i.e., where the term does not exceed `n`), it increments the count of wins.\n5. **Output**: The loop exits when the next term would exceed `n`, and the count of wins (stored in `count`) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the exponential growth of the sequence to determine the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
