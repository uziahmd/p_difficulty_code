He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b (each between 2 and 25) or one integer and then an 'R' for the second part.\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a. The length of this string is at most 1000, but the number might be very large (if base is small and there are many digits) so we have to be careful.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the second token is 'R', then we need to convert the given base-a number to an integer (in base 10), then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    - But note: the input number in base a may contain leading zeros and its length can be up to 1000. However, if it's Roman, the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 and not zero.\n 2. Otherwise, we convert the base-a number to base-b.\n\n However, note that the base-b representation must omit leading zeros.\n\n Important: The base conversion from base a to base b (both between 2 and 25) and from base a to base 10 (for Roman) must handle very large numbers because the base-a string can be long (up to 1000 digits) and base a can be as low as 2. This means the number might be huge (like 2^1000 which is too big for direct conversion with integers). So we need to do the conversion in a smarter way.\n\n But note: the problem says that in any case other than Roman, the number won't be greater than 10^15^10? Actually, wait: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that seems like a typo. Let me check the problem statement: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". So actually, for non-Roman cases, the decimal value of the number is at most 101510? That doesn't make sense because the base can be as low as 2 and the string can be 1000 digits. \n\n Wait, let me read again: \n   \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n Actually, wait the example input includes: '2 2\\n1111001' — that's base 2 to base 2, and the number is 1111001 in base2 which is 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 243 (decimal). But also note the example '12 13\\nA' — which is base12 to base13, and A is 10 in base12, so 10 in base12 is 10 in decimal, then base13 would represent 10 as 'A'.\n\n But the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" — meaning that the decimal value is bounded by 101510? Then we don't have to worry about very large numbers for non-Roman? \n\n Actually, wait: the input says \"a non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103\". And then the guarantee is: \n   - If Roman: the number (decimal) is <= 300010 and not zero.\n   - Otherwise: the number (decimal) is <= 101510.\n\n So actually, we can convert the entire string to an integer in base a, but note: the base a is between 2 and 25, and the string length is at most 1000, but the decimal value is bounded by 101510 (which is 100000+510) only in the non-Roman cases.\n\n However, wait: 101510 is the decimal value? Then if base a is 2, then the maximum decimal value we can get from a string of 1000 digits is 2^1000 - 1, which is way bigger than 101510. But the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". \n\n Let me parse the guarantee: \n   \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n This means that when we are not in the Roman case, the decimal value of the number is at most 101510. So we can safely convert the base-a string to an integer (in base10) without worrying about the exponent being too large? Because 101510 is about 10^5, which is manageable.\n\n But wait: what if the base is 3 and the string has 1000 digits? Then the decimal value could be astronomically large. However, the problem states that in non-Roman cases, the number is <= 101510. Therefore, the input string, though having up to 1000 digits, must represent a decimal number <= 101510. \n\n So, for non-Roman cases, the decimal value is small (<= 101510). Therefore, we can convert the base-a string to a decimal integer by processing each digit and doing the conversion with arithmetic, but we must consider that the base a can be up to 25 and the string can be up to 1000 characters. However, the decimal value is bounded, so even if we use a loop over 1000 digits, the total decimal value will be at most 101510, so the intermediate values will be small.\n\n However, there's a catch: the input string might have leading zeros. But that doesn't change the decimal value.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the first line and split into tokens. Let tokens = [x, y] where x is base a (integer) and y is base b (either integer or 'R').\n\n 2. Read the next line: the string s representing the number in base a.\n\n 3. If y == 'R':\n      Convert the base-a string s to a decimal integer. Since the decimal integer is guaranteed to be <= 300010 (and not zero) OR in the other case (non-Roman) <= 101510, but here we are in Roman so we know the decimal is <=300010 and non-zero.\n      Then convert that decimal integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n 4. Else:\n      Convert the base-a string s to a decimal integer (again, the decimal integer is <= 101510, so safe).\n      Then convert that decimal integer to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25).\n\n But wait: what if the base-a string is \"0\"? Then the decimal integer is 0. However, note the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a ... It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So for Roman, we are guaranteed non-zero and <=300010. For non-Roman, the decimal value is <=101510, but note: the problem does not say the number is non-zero for non-Roman. So we must consider the possibility of zero.\n\n However, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" -> meaning it can be 0? Because 0<=101510. But then the Roman case excludes 0. So for non-Roman, 0 is allowed.\n\n How to handle zero?\n   In base conversion: \n     If the decimal is 0, then we output \"0\".\n\n However, note the example: the input might have leading zeros, but the output must omit leading zeros.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n For base a to base b (non-Roman):\n   Step 1: Convert base-a string to decimal integer (if the string is empty, then 0; but the problem says non-negative and the string length doesn't exceed 1000, but note: if the string is all zeros, then decimal=0).\n\n   Step 2: Convert the decimal integer to base b.\n\n   Special case: if decimal is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n   How to convert base a string to decimal?\n        We can do:\n            num = 0\n            for each char in s:\n                digit_value = int(char) if char is digit else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n                But wait: the base a is between 2 and 25. The digits in base a can be from 0 to a-1. However, the string may contain digits that are represented by digits and letters. The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\"\n\n        But note: the input string is in base a. The digits used must be in the range [0, a-1]. However, the problem says the string may contain leading zeros, and the length is up to 1000.\n\n        However, the problem also says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n        So we can assume the input string is valid for base a.\n\n        But note: the string might contain letters only if base a is greater than 10. And the letters are from 'A' to the letter representing (a-1). For example, if base a=11, then digits are 0-9 and 'A' (which is 10). Similarly, base 12: 0-9, 'A','B'.\n\n        How to map the string to a digit value?\n          We can create a mapping: \n            For each character c in the string:\n              if c is a digit, then d = int(c)\n              else: d = 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A'))\n\n        Then, the decimal value is computed as:\n          num = 0\n          for each digit in the string (from left to right, which is most significant first):\n             num = num * a + d\n\n        However, note: the string might have leading zeros, but that doesn't matter.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the string may contain leading zeros. Our method handles that because multiplying by a and adding 0 doesn't change the value.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the base a is given, and the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. The problem guarantees the input is valid.\n\n        Example: base 16, the string \"0\" is valid, but base 16 cannot have the digit 'G' (since G is 6th letter after F, and F is 15, so base16 uses 0-9 and A-F). The input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\". So the digits are valid.\n\n        However, the decimal value is bounded (<=101510 for non-Roman and <=300010 for Roman) so we can use this conversion.\n\n        But wait: the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and the string length is at most 1000, but the decimal value is bounded by 101510. So even if we do 1000 digits, the total value is bounded, so we can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            # Map char to digit value d\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n            # Check if d >= a? But the problem says the input is valid, so skip this check.\n\n            num = num * a + d\n\n        Then, if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 ones, then num would be (2^1000 - 1) which is huge, but wait: the problem says that in non-Roman cases, the decimal value is <= 101510. So the input string, even though it has 1000 digits, must represent a decimal value <=101510. Therefore, the above loop might break if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 ones? Because 2^1000 is huge.\n\n        However, note: the problem guarantee says that in non-Roman cases, the number (decimal) is <=101510. So the input string must be such that when interpreted in base a, the decimal value is <=101510. \n\n        Therefore, we can safely compute the decimal value by the above method because the intermediate result (num) is bounded by 101510. But wait: the base a is at least 2, and the string length is up to 1000, but the decimal value is bounded. \n\n        Actually, the guarantee is on the decimal value, so we don't have to worry about the intermediate steps being too large because the final value is bounded by 101510 (or 300010). However, the intermediate steps might be larger? \n\n        Example: base a=2, and the string is \"1\" repeated 50 times. Then the decimal value is 2^50 - 1, which is about 1e15, but wait: 101510 is only 10^5. So the guarantee says the number (decimal) is <=101510. Therefore, the string cannot have more than, say, 15 digits in base2 to reach 32768 (which is 2^15) and 300010 is about 2^19 (since 2^19=524288). \n\n        So the input string must be such that the entire number (base a) is <=101510 (non-Roman) or <=300010 (Roman). Therefore, the length of the string in base a is limited by the logarithm base a of 300010. \n\n        Example: base a=2 -> max length is floor(log2(300010)) + 1, which is about 18 or 19.\n\n        So the input string length is at most 1000, but the actual number of digits that contribute to the value is much smaller (because the rest are zeros, but the problem says may contain leading zeros). \n\n        However, we must consider that the entire string might be zeros except the last few digits. But the problem says the decimal value is bounded. \n\n        Therefore, we can safely convert the entire string to a decimal integer, because the decimal integer is bounded by 300010 or 101510, so the intermediate values (even if we do 1000 digits) are bounded by 300010 * a^(1000) ??? \n\n        Wait, no: we are processing from left to right. The first digit is multiplied by a^(n-1) and so on. But the entire number is bounded by 300010, so even if we do 1000 digits, the value is at most 300010. \n\n        However, the problem says the input is in base a, and the digits are valid. The decimal value is bounded, so we can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            d = ... (as above)\n            num = num * a + d\n\n        But if the base a is 2 and the string has 1000 digits, then we are doing 1000 multiplications by 2 and additions. The intermediate value num might become very large (exponentially) even though the final value is bounded by 300010? \n\n        Example: base2, string of 1000 digits. Even if the entire string is zeros, then num remains 0. But if the first digit is 1 and the rest zeros, then after the first digit num becomes 1, then the rest zeros: so we get 1. \n\n        But if the string is \"1\" followed by 999 zeros, then the decimal value is 1, which is <=300010. But the intermediate calculation would be:\n\n          Start: 0\n          After first digit: 0*2 + 1 = 1\n          Then for the next 999 zeros: 1*2 + 0 = 2, then 2*2+0=4, ... until 2^999.\n\n        This is a problem because 2^999 is a number with about 300 digits, which is too big to represent as an integer in Python? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the number of digits is 300, which is acceptable? But the problem says the decimal value is bounded by 300010, so the entire number is at most 300010. \n\n        However, our method for converting from base a to decimal is:\n\n          num = 0\n          for each digit d_i (from left to right):\n              num = num * a + d_i\n\n        This is correct, but the intermediate num might become very large (exponentially in the length of the string) even if the final value is small. \n\n        We must avoid this. Alternative: process the string from right to left? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          num = 0\n          power = 1\n          for i from last character to first:\n              d = ... (same as above)\n              num += d * power\n              power *= a\n\n        But then the same problem: power becomes a^(n) which is huge (like a^1000) and we cannot compute that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the decimal value is bounded (<=300010 or <=101510). We can break early if the current value is already too large? But the problem says the entire number is bounded, so we don't have to break early because the input is valid. However, the intermediate value might be huge.\n\n        We need a better way: we can use the boundedness to limit the computation. But note: the boundedness is on the entire number, not the intermediate. However, the intermediate value (using the left-to-right method) can be huge even if the final value is small because the first digits are multiplied by a^(n-1). \n\n        Example: base 2, string \"1000...0\" (one '1' and 999 zeros). The decimal value is 1, but the intermediate value after processing the first digit is 1, then after the second digit: 1*2+0=2, then 2*2+0=4, ... until 2^999. \n\n        We cannot do 1000 multiplications by 2 if we are going to get a number with 300 digits (which is 2^1000 ~ 1e300, which is too big to store and compare with 300010). \n\n        We need to avoid the exponential growth of the intermediate value. \n\n        Alternative: we can convert the string to decimal by processing the digits and keeping the value as small as possible? But the base a is variable.\n\n        Another idea: since the decimal value is bounded by 300010 or 101510, we can break the conversion if the current value exceeds the bound? But wait, the entire number is bounded, so we can stop if the current value is already > bound and the remaining digits are zeros? \n\n        However, the problem states the entire number is bounded, so we don't have to check for overflow. But the issue is that the intermediate value becomes too large. \n\n        How about using a different algorithm? \n\n        We can use the Horner's method but with a modulus? Or we can use the fact that the base a is small (at most 25) and the maximum decimal value is 300010, so we can set a limit and if during the conversion the current value is already > 300010 (for Roman) or 101510 (otherwise) then we can break early, but note: the entire number is bounded, so the intermediate value might be larger than the bound but then the remaining digits are zeros? \n\n        Actually, the entire number is bounded, so we don't have to break early because the input is valid. But the intermediate value might be too big for the computer to handle. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: convert the string from base a to decimal without building a huge intermediate value by processing the digits in chunks? \n\n        However, note: the problem says the decimal value is bounded by 300010 or 101510, so we can simply convert the entire string to decimal without worrying about the intermediate steps because the maximum intermediate step is at most (bound) * a^(length) but that is not true. \n\n        Actually, the intermediate value in the left-to-right method is the number formed by the first k digits. The maximum k-digit number in base a is (a^k - 1) / (a-1) if a>1. And we require that the entire number (with n digits) is <= bound. But the intermediate value (after k digits) is the value of the first k digits, which can be as large as (a^k - 1) / (a-1). And k can be up to 1000, and a can be up to 25, so a^k is astronomical.\n\n        This is a problem.\n\n        We need to avoid computing the entire decimal value if the base a is small and the string is long, because the intermediate value might be too big.\n\n        But wait: the problem states that the entire number (decimal) is bounded by 300010 or 101510. Therefore, the first k digits (for k large) must be zeros. \n\n        So we can skip leading zeros! \n\n        Example: the string might have many leading zeros. Then the first k digits are zeros, and the intermediate value remains 0 until we hit the first non-zero digit.\n\n        Steps for base a to decimal without building huge numbers:\n\n          We can remove leading zeros? But note: the string might be \"0000\", then the decimal value is 0.\n\n          However, the problem says the string may contain leading zeros.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          s = s.lstrip('0')\n          if s == '':\n              num = 0\n          else:\n              # Now s has no leading zeros, but note: the base a might be 1? No, base a>=2.\n              num = 0\n              for char in s:\n                  d = ... (as before)\n                  num = num * a + d\n\n          But wait: the entire number is bounded by 300010, so the length of s (without leading zeros) is at most floor(log_a(300010)) + 1. \n\n          For base a=2: log2(300010) is about 18, so the string without leading zeros has at most 18 digits.\n\n          For base a=25: log25(300010) is about 3 (because 25^3=15625, 25^4=625*25=156250, 25^5=390625, so 4 digits).\n\n          Therefore, the length of the string (without leading zeros) is at most around 19 for base2 and 5 for base25. \n\n          So we can safely remove leading zeros and then do the conversion. \n\n          However, the problem says the string length is at most 1000, so we can remove the leading zeros and then the inner loop runs at most 19 times (for base2) or 5 times (for base25). \n\n        So the plan:\n\n          Step 1: Read a, b and the string s.\n\n          Step 2: Remove leading zeros from s, unless the string is all zeros then we leave one zero.\n\n          Step 3: Convert the resulting string (without leading zeros) to decimal by the left-to-right method. Since the length is now small, the decimal value is at most 300010 (or 101510) and the intermediate value is built in steps of at most 19 (or 5) digits.\n\n        Example: base2, string \"0001010\" -> remove leading zeros -> \"1010\", then convert to decimal: 8.\n\n        This is efficient.\n\n        But note: the problem says the string may contain leading zeros, so we must remove them. However, if the string is empty, then we output 0.\n\n        Steps for non-Roman:\n\n          s_clean = s.lstrip('0')\n          if s_clean == '':\n              num = 0\n          else:\n              num = 0\n              for char in s_clean:\n                  if char in '0123456789':\n                      d = int(char)\n                  else:\n                      d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                  # Since the base a is given, we must ensure d < a? The problem says the input is valid, so we assume d < a.\n                  num = num * a + d\n\n          Then, convert num to base b (if num==0 then output \"0\", else convert)\n\n        Steps for Roman:\n\n          Same as above, but then we convert num (which is <=300010) to Roman.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that in Roman case, the number is not zero, so we don't have to handle zero in Roman.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\" — meaning non-Roman, so for Roman we have a separate guarantee (<=300010 and not zero). \n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if b == 'R':\n              num = 0\n              s_clean = s.lstrip('0')\n              if s_clean == '':\n                  num = 0\n              else:\n                  for char in s_clean:\n                      if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                          d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                      else:\n                          d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                      num = num * a + d\n              # Now, we know num is between 1 and 300010 (inclusive) and we need to convert to Roman.\n\n          else:\n              # similar for num, but then convert to base b.\n\n        But note: the input base a and base b are given as integers (except when b is 'R'). \n\n        Now, how to convert a decimal integer (num) to base b (if non-Roman)?\n\n        Steps:\n\n          if num == 0:\n              print(\"0\")\n          else:\n              digits = []\n              while num:\n                  r = num % b\n                  digits.append(r)\n                  num = num // b\n\n              Then, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first). Then we map each digit to a character:\n\n              For digits in base b (integer between 2 and 25):\n\n                For digit d (0 <= d < b):\n                  if d < 10:\n                      char = str(d)\n                  else:\n                      char = chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n              Then reverse the list and output.\n\n        However, note: the example input '12 13\\nA' — base12 string \"A\" is 10 in base12, then convert 10 to base13: 10 // 13 = 0 remainder 10 -> so we output 'A'. \n\n        But wait: the example input: \n          Input: ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n        Expected Output: ['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n        Let's check:\n\n          First: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10 to base2: 1 in base10 is 1 in base2 -> '1'\n\n          Second: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base16 to Roman: 5 in base16 is 5 (decimal) -> Roman numeral for 5 is 'V'\n\n          Third: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base5 to Roman: 4 in base5 is 4 (decimal) -> Roman numeral for 4 is 'IV'\n\n          Fourth: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2 to base2: 1111001 in base2 is 1111001 (but wait, we remove leading zeros: but there are none) -> output the same string? Actually, the base2 representation of 1111001 (base2) is the same string? But the problem says: \"write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\" So we must output the string without leading zeros. But the input string is \"1111001\", and we removed leading zeros (none) so we output \"1111001\". However, the example output is \"1111001\".\n\n          Fifth: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12 string \"A\" is 10, then base13: 10 -> 'A'\n\n        So the code for non-Roman:\n\n          s_clean = s.lstrip('0')\n          if s_clean == '':\n              num = 0\n          else:\n              num = 0\n              for char in s_clean:\n                  if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                      d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                  else:\n                      d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                  # But wait: the base a is given, and the digits must be less than a. We assume the input is valid.\n                  num = num * a + d\n\n          if num == 0:\n              print(\"0\")\n          else:\n              digits = []\n              n = num\n              while n:\n                  r = n % b_int   # Here, b_int is the integer base (from the input)\n                  digits.append(r)\n                  n //= b_int\n\n              # Now, convert each digit to character\n              s_base_b = ''\n              for d in reversed(digits):\n                  if d < 10:\n                      s_base_b += str(d)\n                  else:\n                      s_base_b += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n              print(s_base_b)\n\n        But wait, what if the base b is 1? The problem says base b is between 2 and 25 (if not 'R'), so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        We are guaranteed that the decimal value is between 1 and 300010.\n\n        We need a function to convert an integer in the range [1, 300010] to a Roman numeral.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n          We can use a list of tuples for the Roman numerals, from highest to lowest.\n\n          Standard Roman numerals: \n            M = 1000, CM = 900, D = 500, CD = 400, C = 100, XC = 90, L = 50, XL = 40, X = 10, IX = 9, V = 5, IV = 4, I = 1.\n\n          But note: the problem says the subtractive principle: IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM.\n\n          We can define:\n\n          roman_numerals = [\n              (1000, \"M\"),\n              (900, \"CM\"),\n              (500, \"D\"),\n              (400, \"CD\"),\n              (100, \"C\"),\n              (90, \"XC\"),\n              (50, \"L\"),\n              (40, \"XL\"),\n              (10, \"X\"),\n              (9, \"IX\"),\n              (5, \"V\"),\n              (4, \"IV\"),\n              (1, \"I\")\n          ]\n\n          Then:\n\n          def to_roman(n):\n              res = ''\n              for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                  while n >= value:\n                      res += symbol\n                      n -= value\n              return res\n\n          But note: the number is at most 300010, which is 300 thousand and ten. \n\n          The highest Roman numeral we have is M (1000). 300010 is 300000 + 10. \n\n          However, 300000 is not a standard Roman numeral. The problem says the number is at most 300010, and the example includes 300010.\n\n          Standard Roman numerals did not have a standard for numbers beyond 3999. But the problem states that the number is up to 300010.\n\n          We can extend the system by using bars or other notations? But the problem does not specify. However, the examples are small (like 5,4) and the guarantee is up to 300010.\n\n          According to the problem statement, the subtractive principle is used, but there is no defined symbol for 10000, 100000, etc. \n\n          But note: the problem says \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\". This refers to the standard subtractive principle for multiples (like IV, IX, etc.). \n\n          However, the example output for 300010 is not provided. But the problem says the number is <=300010 and not zero.\n\n          How to represent 300010?\n\n          We can break it down:\n\n          300010 = 300000 + 10\n\n          But 300000: we can use 300000 = 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the additive principle for thousands: 300000 = MMM... (300 thousands) but that would be 300 'M's, which is not practical.\n\n          However, the problem says \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that was for the base representation, not for Roman.\n\n          And the example numbers are small. The problem says the number is at most 300010, so we must represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n          But wait, the problem statement also says: \"Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: ...\", and then the subtractive principle. There is no mention of additional symbols for higher places.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010\".\n\n          We have to decide on a representation for numbers beyond 3999. One common way is to put a bar over a numeral to multiply by 10, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the standard additive method and just repeat the 'M' up to 3000 times. But 300000 is 3000 M's? That's acceptable for the problem? The output is a string, and the problem says the example outputs are small. \n\n          But 300000 would be \"MM...M\" (300000/1000 = 300 times M). Then add \"X\" for 10.\n\n          However, the example input '16 R\\n5' gives 'V', so the output is a string. \n\n          But the problem does not specify an alternative for large numbers. \n\n          Let me check the example: the example inputs for Roman are 5 and 4, which are small.\n\n          Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, we can use:\n\n          We'll break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones, but for thousands we can use",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, possibly including Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a decimal (base-10) representation, and then converting that decimal number to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values which include the source base `a`, the target base `b` (which might be 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number string in base `a`.\n2. **Leading Zero Handling**: Remove any leading zeros from the input number string to simplify the conversion process.\n3. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the cleaned number string from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by multiplying the current total by the base and adding the digit's value.\n4. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols.\n   - **Standard Base**: If the target base is a standard integer base, convert the decimal number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their respective digits (including letters for values greater than 9).\n5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero by directly outputting \"0\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    s = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except Exception:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n\n    s_clean = s.lstrip('0')\n    if s_clean == '':\n        num = 0\n    else:\n        num = 0\n        for char in s_clean:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            if d >= a:\n                print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                return\n            num = num * a + d\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, \"M\"),\n                (900, \"CM\"),\n                (500, \"D\"),\n                (400, \"CD\"),\n                (100, \"C\"),\n                (90, \"XC\"),\n                (50, \"L\"),\n                (40, \"XL\"),\n                (10, \"X\"),\n                (9, \"IX\"),\n                (5, \"V\"),\n                (4, \"IV\"),\n                (1, \"I\")\n            ]\n            roman_str = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while num >= value:\n                    roman_str += symbol\n                    num -= value\n            print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        b_int = b\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = num\n            while n:\n                r = n % b_int\n                digits.append(r)\n                n //= b_int\n            s_base_b = ''\n            for d in reversed(digits):\n                if d < 10:\n                    s_base_b += str(d)\n                else:\n                    s_base_b += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            print(s_base_b)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input lines, parsing the source and target bases along with the number string.\n2. **Leading Zero Removal**: The input number string is stripped of leading zeros to ensure accurate conversion.\n3. **Decimal Conversion**: The cleaned number string is converted to a decimal integer by processing each digit, converting it from its symbolic representation (digits or letters) to its numerical value, and accumulating the total.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.\n5. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard bases, the decimal number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected and mapped to digits (0-9 or A-Z for values above 9).
