Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We want to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n 3. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, note that we are looking for the longest such substring.\n\n Approach:\n Since the maximum length of the string is 100, we can try from the longest possible substring (which is floor(n/2) because two copies must be present, but note: they can overlap so we might have a substring that is longer than n/2? Actually, no: if we have two occurrences, even if they overlap, the total length of two occurrences is 2 * L, but the entire string is n. The condition is that the two occurrences must lie within the string. However, note that overlapping is allowed, so the substring can appear more than twice and we are just looking for at least two.\n\n But note: the two occurrences must be contiguous and non-overlapping in the sense of being separate? Actually, the problem says \"occurrences can overlap\". So, for example, \"aaa\" has substring \"aa\" appearing starting at index0 and index1.\n\n However, the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n We can do:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   We'll start by checking for the longest possible substring that repeats. The maximum length of a repeating substring cannot exceed floor(n/2) if we require two non-overlapping? But wait, the problem allows overlapping. However, if we have two occurrences that are identical and they can overlap, then the maximum length is still bounded by the entire string. Actually, the two occurrences don't have to cover the whole string, but they must be two distinct starting positions.\n\n Example: \"ababa\" -> the substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2, so length 3.\n\n How to check?\n   We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the entire string might not be repeated, but we are only concerned with the substring.\n\n However, we can also use a dictionary to record every substring and its starting indices. Then, we look for the longest substring that has at least two occurrences.\n\n Steps:\n   Option 1: \n     For length L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (but actually, the maximum L we need to consider is n//2? Not exactly: if the string is \"abcabc\", then we have two occurrences of \"abc\" (non-overlapping) and the length is 3, which is 6//2. But what about \"aaa\": \n        s = \"aaa\": \n          substring \"a\" appears at indices 0,1,2 -> valid, but also \"aa\" appears at indices 0 and 1. And \"aaa\" appears only once as a contiguous substring? Actually, in \"aaa\", the substring \"aaa\" starts at index0 only. But wait, if we take two occurrences: \n          The substring \"a\" is the same and appears multiple times, and \"aa\" also appears twice (at index0 and index1). However, the problem asks for the longest.\n\n   But note: the two occurrences must be two distinct starting indices. For \"aaa\":\n        length 3: substring \"aaa\" appears only once (at index0) -> not valid.\n        length 2: substring \"aa\" appears at index0 and index1 -> valid. So answer is 2.\n\n   However, note that the substring \"a\" (length 1) also appears three times, but we are looking for the longest.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n     Let n = len(s)\n     Let max_len = 0\n\n     We can iterate over all starting indices and then over substring lengths, but that would be O(n^2) and then checking duplicates for each substring might be O(n^2) again, leading to O(n^4). But n is at most 100, so worst-case 100^4 = 100000000 which is acceptable in Pyton in many cases, but let me think: we can do better.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a set or dictionary for each length.\n\n   Better approach:\n\n     We can iterate over lengths from min(n, ...) but we want the longest. So we start from the maximum possible length (which is floor(n/2) because if we have two identical substrings, the maximum length is when they are adjacent and non-overlapping? Actually, no: if we have \"aaaa\", then the maximum length is 3: because \"aaa\" appears at index0 and index1. So the maximum length L must satisfy:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring appears more than once. The key observation here is that the longest such substring will be the largest in length where at least two distinct starting positions yield the same substring.\n2. **Intuition**: We can leverage a dictionary to keep track of substrings and their occurrence counts. By iterating over all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest, we can efficiently find the first substring that meets the criteria (appearing at least twice), ensuring optimality.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible starting indices of the string.\n   - For each starting index, expand the substring length from 1 up to the remaining characters in the string.\n   - Use a dictionary to record each substring and its starting positions. If a substring is encountered more than once, note its length.\n   - Since we are checking from longer to shorter substrings, the first valid length found will be the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible substrings, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    seen = {}\n    max_len = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n            substr = s[i:j]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n                if seen[substr] >= 2 and len(substr) > max_len:\n                    max_len = len(substr)\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n                \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: A dictionary `seen` is used to keep track of substrings and their occurrence counts. `max_len` is initialized to 0 to store the length of the longest repeating substring found.\n3. **Nested Loops**: The outer loop iterates over each character in the string as the starting index of a substring. The inner loop extends the substring from the current starting index to the end of the string.\n4. **Substring Check**: For each generated substring, the code checks if it has been seen before. If it has, the count is incremented, and if the count reaches 2 and the substring length is greater than the current `max_len`, `max_len` is updated.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all possible substrings, the maximum length found is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible substrings in a systematic manner, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
