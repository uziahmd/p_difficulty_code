    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners we double-counted? Actually, the border of an a x b grid has 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, wait: the example input '3 3 1' gives 8. \n        For a 3x3 grid: \n          2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n But for the next example: '7 9 1'\n        Using the same formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Then for the third example: '7 9 2'\n        First ring (k=1): uses the outer 7x9 -> 28 cells.\n        Second ring: i=2, so we consider the inner rectangle: (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4 = 3, and (9-4)=5 -> 3x5.\n        Then the second ring is the border of the 3x5 rectangle: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n However, note: the problem says there should be k rings, but we must check the condition on k: \n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n Why? Because the inner rectangle for the i-th ring must have positive dimensions. For the i-th ring, the dimensions are:\n        width = w - 4*(i-1)\n        height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n We require both to be at least 1 (so that the ring exists). But note: the ring is defined by the border of an inner rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have at least 2x2 to have a border (because the border is the outer layer, then the inner part is one cell less in each dimension? Actually, no: the ring is the outer layer of the inner rectangle. So the inner rectangle must have at least 2x2 to have a border? \n\n Let me clarify with the example: \n   First ring: requires w>=2 and h>=2? Actually, the problem states that the first ring goes along the edge, so the entire grid must be at least 3x3 (as given). \n\n But note: the condition in the input says: \n        k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4)\n\n Why divided by 4? Because each ring reduces the grid by 4 on each side (so after i rings, we have reduced by 4*(i) from the original? Actually, for the i-th ring, we use an inner rectangle that is (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n The condition ensures that we don't ask for more rings than the grid can support. \n\n However, note: the ring i requires that the inner rectangle has non-negative dimensions and also that it has at least 2x2 (so that we can form a border). Actually, the border of a 1x1 would be 1 cell (but that doesn't make sense for a ring of width 1 because the border is the outer layer and then the inner part would be 0). \n\n But the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) means that the largest i we can have is when the inner rectangle has at least 1 cell in each dimension? Actually, the condition is given as:\n\n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n However, note: \n        The smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is min(w, h) - 4*(i-1). We require that this is at least 1 (so that the rectangle exists). \n\n But the problem says: the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)), so we must have w-4*(i-1) >= 1 and h-4*(i-1) >= 1. \n\n Then the maximum i is the maximum integer such that:\n        i-1 <= (min(w,h)-1)/4   => i <= (min(w,h)-1)//4 + 1\n\n However, note: the condition is given as k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n Let's test with w=h=3: \n        floor((3+1)/4) = floor(4/4)=1 -> k<=1, which is correct.\n\n With w=h=7: \n        floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> k<=2, which is correct because two rings: \n            first: 7x7 -> border: 2*7+2*7-4 = 28-4=24? Wait, wait: \n            Actually, the first ring: 7x7 -> border: 2*7+2*7-4 = 28-4=24? But wait, our example was 7x9, not 7x7.\n\n But wait, the example input is 7,9,2. Here min(7,9)=7 -> floor((7+1)/4)=2 -> so k=2 is allowed.\n\n Now, how do we compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n\n For the i-th ring (with i starting from 1):\n        Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        The ring is the border of the n_i x m_i rectangle. How many cells?\n        The border has: \n            top and bottom: each has n_i cells, but then subtract the two corners (because they are included in the sides) or not? Actually, we count the entire border.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n            total cells in the rectangle = n_i * m_i\n            the inner rectangle (without the border) is (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) [if n_i>=2 and m_i>=2] \n            Then the border = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n\n        Expanding: \n            = n_i*m_i - [n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4]\n            = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n        This is the same as the formula we used earlier.\n\n        But note: if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2, then the border formula doesn't hold (we cannot form a border). However, the condition on k ensures that for each ring i (from 1 to k) we have:\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1) >= 1\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1) >= 1\n\n        But for the border to exist, we actually need n_i>=2 and m_i>=2? Not exactly: if the rectangle is 1x something, then the border is the entire rectangle (since the border is the outer layer and the inner part is 0). Similarly, for 1x1, the border is the single cell.\n\n        However, the problem says the ring has width 1, so for a 1x1 we get 1 cell. For a 1x2: we get 2 cells (both ends). For a 1x3: we get 4 cells? Actually, no: the border of a 1x3: \n            It's a single row of 3 cells. The border is the entire row? But wait, the problem says \"all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\", meaning the outer layer. In a 1x3, the entire thing is the border. So the border is 3.\n\n        But our formula: 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4 = 2*1 + 2*3 - 4 = 2+6-4 = 4, which does not match 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the area method: \n            For a rectangle of a x b, the border (if we take the outer layer) is:\n                If a==1 and b==1: 1\n                If a==1 and b>1: b (because the entire row is the border)\n                If a>=2 and b>=2: 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But note: the problem says the ring has width 1. So the ring is the outer layer, and then the next ring would be the next outer layer. \n\n        Actually, the problem defines the i-th ring by the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)), and the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n        However, the border of a rectangle of size a x b (with a>=1, b>=1) is:\n            If a==1 and b==1: 1\n            If a==1 and b>1: b\n            If a>1 and b==1: a\n            If a>=2 and b>=2: 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But wait, let's check with a=1, b=3: \n            We have 3 cells. The border is the entire thing, so 3.\n\n        However, the problem's example only gave k up to floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For a 3x3, k<=1. For a 1x3, k<= floor((min(1,3)+1)/4)=floor(2/4)=0. So k=1 is not allowed. But our input condition says w,h>=3, so we don't have to worry about 1x3.\n\n        Since w, h >= 3, the first ring requires at least 3x3. Then for the next ring, the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). And since w,h>=3, then w-4 and h-4 might be negative? \n\n        Actually, the condition on k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has non-negative dimensions. But note: for k=1, we have w-0 and h-0, which are >=3 (so positive). For k=2, we require w>=4 and h>=4? \n\n        The condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) implies that the smallest dimension must be at least 4*(k-1)+1. \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> k=1 is allowed.\n\n        w=4, h=4, k=1: \n            floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1 -> k=1 allowed. \n            Then for k=2: floor((4+1)/4)=1, so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        But wait, for a 4x4 grid, the first ring: \n            border: 2*4+2*4-4 = 8+8-4=12\n            Then the second ring would use the inner rectangle 0x0 (because 4-4=0) -> which is invalid. So indeed k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions (w-4*(i-1)) and (h-4*(i-1)) are at least 1 (nonnegative) and the condition ensures that we don't go below 1.\n\n        However, the formula for the border must handle the case when the rectangle has one row or one column.\n\n        But note: the input condition w, h >= 3, and k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        What is the minimum value for the inner rectangle for the i-th ring?\n            After i rings, the dimensions are w - 4*(i-1) and h - 4*(i-1). The condition ensures that even for the last ring (i=k) the dimensions are at least 1.\n\n        Now, how to compute the border for a rectangle of a x b (a,b>=1)?\n\n        We can use:\n            If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n            Else if a == 1: b   (because the entire row is the border)\n            Else if b == 1: a\n            Else: 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        However, note: the problem's definition of the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n        But wait, the problem says the ring has width 1. In the case of a rectangle that is more than 1x1, the border is the outer layer. \n\n        However, the above formula for the border is standard for a grid.\n\n        But note: the example input 3x3 gives 8. Using the formula: \n            a=3, b=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: 4x4 -> first ring: 2*4+2*4-4= 8+8-4=12.\n\n        Now, what if the rectangle is 2x2? \n            According to the formula: 2*2+2*2-4 = 4+4-4=4 -> which is correct (each cell is adjacent to the border? Actually, in a 2x2, the border is the entire grid, so 4 cells.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the ring has width 1. In a 2x2, the ring is the entire grid because there's no inner part. So 4 cells is correct.\n\n        Now, if the rectangle is 1x1: 1 cell (correct).\n\n        However, the condition of the input says w, h>=3, and k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we might not encounter a 1x1 in the middle ring? Actually, we might: if k is large enough to reduce the grid to 1x1, then we have to account for that.\n\n        Example: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. So k=1 only.\n\n        But wait, the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) and also k>=1.\n\n        How about w=5, h=5, k=2? \n            Condition: floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        Now, consider w=5, h=5, k=1: \n            The border: 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n        But what if we have a grid that becomes 1x1 in one dimension? For example, w=5, h=6, k=2?\n            Condition: floor((min(5,6)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        Actually, the condition is computed from the minimum dimension. \n\n        So, we can write a function to compute the border for a given (a, b):\n\n        def border_cells(a, b):\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                return 0\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                return 1\n            if a == 1:\n                return b\n            if b == 1:\n                return a\n            return 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        However, note: the condition of the input ensures that we never get negative dimensions and that the rings are defined until the inner rectangle is at least 1x1 (so the above function is safe).\n\n        Then the total gilded cells is the sum for i from 1 to k of border_cells(w-4*(i-1), h-4*(i-1))\n\n        But wait, the problem says the first ring is the outer edge, the second is 2 cells away, etc.\n\n        However, note: the example 7x9, k=2: \n            i=1: a=7, b=9 -> border_cells(7,9)= 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28\n            i=2: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> border_cells(3,5)= 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12\n            Total=28+12=40.\n\n        But wait, what if the grid is reduced in both dimensions? The reduction is symmetric: we subtract 4*(i-1) from both w and h.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n        Read w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            # Compute the border for a x b\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # Shouldn't happen by the condition, but break if negative.\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        Print(total)\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: 3 3 1 -> \n            i=1: a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4=8 -> total=8.\n\n        Example 2: 7 9 1 -> \n            i=1: a=7, b=9 -> else: 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28 -> total=28.\n\n        Example 3: 7 9 2 -> \n            i=1: 28\n            i=2: a=3, b=5 -> else: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total=40.\n\n        But wait, the example input was provided as:\n            Input: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n            Output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't need to worry about having negative dimensions in the loop, because the condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has dimensions at least 1x1.\n\n        But note: what if w and h are different? \n        Example: w=10, h=3, k= floor((min(10,3)+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1.\n            Then only one ring: \n                a=10, b=3 -> since b==3 (which is >1) and a=10>1, so we use the else branch: 2*10+2*3-4=20+6-4=22.\n\n        Let's verify: a 10x3 grid: \n            The border: top and bottom rows: 10 cells each, and the two vertical sides: 3-2=1 cell in the middle (because the top and bottom already covered the two ends). \n            Actually, the border: \n                Top: 10\n                Bottom: 10\n                Middle row: the two sides (excluding the top and bottom ends) -> 10-2 = 8? No, wait: the grid is 10 columns and 3 rows.\n\n            Actually, the border should be: \n                The entire outer frame. The top and bottom rows are 10 each. The two middle sides (the left and right columns) are the two cells in the middle row (since the top and bottom are already taken). So the border is: 10 (top) + 10 (bottom) + 2 (left and right in the middle row) = 22.\n\n        So the formula works.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n        However, note: the condition in the problem also says that k is at least 1 and at most the given bound. So we don't need to check for k being too large, because the input ensures that.\n\n        But what if the input k is 0? The problem says k>=1, so we don't have to handle k=0.\n\n        Code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, then the second 2 cells away, etc. So we are always starting from the outermost and going inward.\n\n        We are using the same formula for each ring.\n\n        Let me test with a square of 5x5 and k= floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> only one ring.\n\n        One ring: 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n        Then, a 5x5 grid: the border is the outer 5x5: \n            Top:5, bottom:5, left:5-2=3, right:5-2=3 -> but wait, the left and right include the top and bottom, so actually: \n            Top:5, bottom:5, and the middle three rows: the left and right columns (without the top and bottom) -> 3 rows * 2 = 6 -> total 5+5+6=16 -> correct.\n\n        Another test: 5x5, k=2? \n            Condition: floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed. So we don't need to compute.\n\n        However, if we try to compute for k=2 (even though the condition says it's not allowed) then we would get:\n            i=1: 16\n            i=2: a=5-4=1, b=5-4=1 -> then we use the 1x1 case: 1 cell.\n            Total=17.\n\n        But the condition in the input ensures k is at most the given bound, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Read the input, split and convert to integers.\n\n        Then, iterate from i=0 to i=k-1 (or i from 1 to k) and for each ring i (starting at 1) compute the dimensions and then the border.\n\n        Print the total.\n\n        However, note: the problem's example input is given as a list of strings, but the problem says the input is one line with three integers.\n\n        We'll read one line and split.\n\n        Example: \n            data = input().split()\n            w = int(data[0])\n            h = int(data[1])\n            k = int(data[2])\n\n        Then proceed.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say w, h between 3 and 100, and k from 1 to floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        This code should be efficient because k is at most around min(w,h)/4, and min(w,h)<=100, so k<=25, which is small.\n\n        I think we are good.\n\n        However, we can also derive a closed-form formula to avoid looping, but since k is small, it's not necessary.\n\n        Let's stick to the loop.\n\n        Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. The challenge is to compute the total number of cells covered by these rings efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. Each ring is the border of an inner rectangle that shrinks by 4 cells in both dimensions (2 cells on each side) for each subsequent ring. The key insight is that each ring's cell count can be derived from the dimensions of its corresponding inner rectangle.\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the number of cells is the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus the cells that would be part of the next inner ring (if it existed). However, since the rings are defined by their borders, we can compute the cell count for each ring using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each ring from 1 to k, adjusting the dimensions of the plate for each iteration, and then applying the border calculation formula. The border cells for a rectangle of size a x b are:\n   - If a or b is 1, the border is simply the length of the other dimension.\n   - Otherwise, the border is `2*a + 2*b - 4` (accounting for the four corners being counted twice).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of rings. Given that k is bounded by floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4) and w, h are at most 100, this approach is efficient with a maximum of about 25 iterations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    w = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2])\n    \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            total += 1\n        elif a == 1:\n            total += b\n        elif b == 1:\n            total += a\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n            \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and number of rings (k) of the plate.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to zero to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Adjust Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are calculated by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both the original width and height (since each ring reduces the plate by 2 cells on each side).\n   - **Border Calculation**: Depending on the dimensions of the inner rectangle, the number of border cells is computed:\n     - If both dimensions are 1, the border is 1 cell.\n     - If one dimension is 1, the border is the length of the other dimension.\n     - For larger dimensions, the border is `2*a + 2*b - 4` to account for the perimeter without double-counting corners.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
