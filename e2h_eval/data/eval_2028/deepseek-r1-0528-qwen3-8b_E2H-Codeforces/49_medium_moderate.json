They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n (number of lawns) and m (number of roads). Then m lines, each with four numbers: a, b, gcd, lcm (the two lawns connected and the gcd and lcm for the two numbers on those lawns).\n\n We know that for two numbers x and y (on the two lawns), we have:\n   gcd(x, y) = g, lcm(x, y) = l.\n And it is known that: x * y = g^2 * (x/g) * (y/g) = g^2 * (x//g) * (y//g) = g^2 * (lcm(x,y) / g) ??? Actually, note that:\n   x * y = gcd(x, y) * lcm(x, y)\n\n But wait: actually, we have the identity: gcd(x, y) * lcm(x, y) = x * y.\n\n Therefore, for an edge (a, b, g, l), the two numbers x and y must satisfy:\n   x * y = g * l\n\n Also, note that x and y must be multiples of g (since g is the gcd). So we can write:\n   x = g * x', y = g * y'\n Then, the equation becomes: g^2 * x' * y' = g * l  =>  g * x' * y' = l.\n\n Moreover, the condition that the gcd of x and y is g is equivalent to gcd(x', y') = 1.\n\n So for each edge, the two numbers are determined by factors of (l // g) that are coprime. However, note that the same lawn might appear in multiple edges, so we have to assign a number to each lawn such that for every edge (a, b) with given gcd and lcm, the two numbers assigned to a and b satisfy the above conditions.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge gives constraints on the two nodes.\n\n 2. For an edge (u, v, g, l):\n      Let L = l // g. Then the two numbers for u and v must be of the form g * d and g * (L // d) where d divides L and gcd(d, L//d)==1.\n\n 3. However, note that the same node must have the same number throughout the graph.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can try to assign a value to each node. But note: the constraints are multiplicative and involve the product (g*l) for each edge.\n\n    Observation:\n        Let the number for node i be x_i.\n        Then for an edge between i and j: \n            gcd(x_i, x_j) = g, and lcm(x_i, x_j) = l, and also x_i * x_j = g * l.\n\n        Also, note that the gcd condition implies that x_i and x_j must be multiples of g, and then the quotient must be coprime.\n\n    However, we have multiple edges. We can use a union-find or DFS/BFS to propagate the constraints.\n\n    But note: the product condition must hold for every edge. Also, the gcd condition must hold.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think about the prime factorizations. The entire system must be consistent.\n\n    Another idea: Since we have the product for every edge, we can consider the entire graph and the product of all numbers? Actually, note that if the graph is connected, then we can set up equations.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require unique solution, just one.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    a. Check consistency for each edge: \n        For an edge (u, v, g, l), we must have g*g <= g*l (which is true because l>=g) and also g*l must be divisible by g (so l divisible by g) and then we can define L = l//g.\n\n        Moreover, we can let x_i = g_i * ... but wait, the gcd for different edges might impose different g's on the same node. \n\n    Alternatively, we can set up:\n\n        Let x_i be the number for node i.\n\n        For each edge (u, v, g, l): \n            Condition 1: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n            Condition 2: gcd(x_u, x_v) = g.\n\n        Also, from condition 2, we have that g divides both x_u and x_v.\n\n        How to assign?\n\n        We can start by assuming that the entire graph is connected. If not, we have to handle each connected component separately.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify connectivity.\n\n    Another approach:\n\n        Since the product condition is multiplicative, we can take logarithms? But then we have integer factors.\n\n    Insight:\n\n        Consider that for an edge (u, v, g, l), the two numbers must be divisors of (g * l) and must be multiples of g. Moreover, they must be such that their gcd is exactly g.\n\n        However, note: the same node must satisfy all edges incident to it.\n\n        We can try to assign a base value for each node. Notice that the entire graph must satisfy that for every edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n            Let A = x_u, B = x_v, then A*B = g*l, and gcd(A, B) = g.\n\n        Also, note that if we define for each node i, let d_i be the gcd of all the edges incident to i? Not exactly.\n\n    Alternate Insight:\n\n        Let x_i = g_i * k_i, but then the gcd condition for an edge (i, j) would require that g_i and g_j are at least the common divisor, and the k_i and k_j must be coprime.\n\n        However, note that the gcd of the two numbers (g_i * k_i and g_j * k_j) must be g. This implies that g must divide both, so g must be a common divisor. Also, the gcd of (k_i, k_j) must be 1 and the gcd of (g_i, g_j) must be g? Actually, no.\n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have an edge (u, v) with g=6, and let x_u=12, x_v=18. Then gcd(12,18)=6, and 12*18=216 = 6*36. Then we can write:\n                x_u = 6 * 2, x_v = 6 * 3, and gcd(2,3)=1.\n\n        But what if there are multiple edges incident to u? Then the same node u must have the same number for all edges.\n\n        So the challenge is: for each node, we must assign a number x_i that satisfies all the edges incident to it.\n\n        Conditions for an edge (u, v) with (g, l):\n            x_u * x_v = g * l, and gcd(x_u, x_v)=g.\n\n        We can break down the constraints by prime factors. However, note that g and l are given and might be large (up to 10^6).\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: For each edge, check that g divides l. If not, output \"NO\". Also, we must have g <= min(x_u, x_v) and g<=min(l) in some sense? Actually, the gcd cannot exceed the numbers, and the lcm must be at least max(x_u, x_v) and at most x_u*x_v/g (but we have the product condition).\n\n        Actually, the product condition and gcd condition are necessary and sufficient for the existence of two numbers (if we ignore the graph constraints). However, the graph constraints require consistency across multiple edges.\n\n        Step 2: We can try to assign a candidate value for each node. One idea is to set:\n\n            Let the entire graph be connected. Then we can fix one node (say node 0) arbitrarily. But note: the product condition is multiplicative and the gcd condition is additive in exponents.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            For each edge (u, v, g, l), we know that x_u and x_v must multiply to g*l. Moreover, the gcd is g. \n\n            Consider the ratio: x_u / g and x_v / g must be coprime and their product is l//g.\n\n            So we can factorize l//g and then choose two coprime factors (d, l//g // d) for the two nodes.\n\n        However, we have to assign the same number to a node from all its incident edges.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let x_i be the number for node i.\n\n            Then for each edge (i, j, g, l):\n                x_i * x_j = g * l.\n\n            This is a system of equations. But note: the graph might be disconnected, then we have independent components.\n\n        But wait: the equation x_i * x_j = g*l for an edge is very strong. It says that the product of the two numbers is fixed. However, the entire graph must have the same assignment for each node.\n\n        We can try to solve the system by assigning one variable arbitrarily and then propagating, but the equations are multiplicative and we have integer constraints.\n\n        However, note: the product condition must hold for every edge. Then, if we fix one node, say node 0, to a value x0, then for any neighbor j of node 0, we have:\n            x0 * x_j = g0 * l0   => x_j = (g0 * l0) / x0.\n\n        Then, for an edge (j, k) with gcd g1 and lcm l1, we have:\n            x_j * x_k = g1 * l1   => x_k = (g1 * l1) / x_j.\n\n        But note: x_j is already fixed by the first edge, so x_k is fixed. Then we must check that the gcd condition holds for the edge (j, k): gcd(x_j, x_k) must be g1.\n\n        However, this propagation is only possible if the division is exact (i.e., x0 divides g0*l0, then x_j must be integer, etc.). \n\n        But wait: the problem states that the initial map had numbers between 1 and 10^6. However, the restored numbers must be integers. But the input constraints say that the gcd and lcm are at least 1 and at most 10^6, and the product g*l might be up to 10^12, which is acceptable for Python integers.\n\n        However, the issue: the assignment must be integers. So we must ensure that the divisions are exact.\n\n        Steps for connected graph:\n\n            - Start by assigning an arbitrary value to node 0. But what value? We don't know the range. However, note that from the product condition, the value must be a divisor of the product of all the edges? Actually, we can set the value for node 0 to be 1? But wait: then for an edge (0, j) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n                    x0 * x_j = g * l  => 1 * x_j = g*l, so x_j = g*l.\n\n                Then for an edge (j, k) with gcd g1 and lcm l1, we have:\n                    x_j * x_k = g1 * l1  => (g*l) * x_k = g1 * l1  => x_k = (g1 * l1) / (g*l)\n\n                Then we must check that (g*l) divides (g1*l1) and that the gcd condition holds.\n\n            But is that necessarily the case? The value for node 0 is fixed arbitrarily to 1. Then the entire assignment is fixed. However, is this assignment valid for all edges? \n\n            However, note: the gcd condition for the edge (0, j) is: gcd(1, g*l) = 1. But the input specifies that the gcd is g. So unless g==1, this fails.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily set node0 to 1. \n\n        Let's reframe:\n\n            For an edge (u, v, g, l), the two numbers must be (g * a) and (g * b) with a*b = l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n            Then the entire graph must be consistent with such representations.\n\n        Another idea: factorize the product condition and the gcd condition. But the numbers can be as large as 10^6, so factoring each edge's l//g might be heavy if done repeatedly.\n\n        Instead, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: For each edge, check that g divides l. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n            Step 2: For each edge, compute L = l // g. Then, we need to assign two numbers (x, y) such that:\n                    x = g * a, y = g * b, with a*b = L and gcd(a,b)==1.\n\n            Then, the entire graph must assign to each node a number that is a multiple of the gcd of all edges incident to it? Not exactly.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            Let the number for node i be x_i.\n\n            Then for each edge (i, j, g, l):\n                x_i * x_j = g * l.\n\n            This is a linear system in the log space? But we require integer solutions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following theorem:\n\n            In a graph, if we have for each edge (i, j): x_i * x_j = c_{ij}, then the graph must be bipartite? Actually, no, but the condition is multiplicative and the product must be consistent. \n\n            Example: triangle (three edges) with products p1, p2, p3. Then we have:\n                x1*x2 = p12\n                x2*x3 = p23\n                x1*x3 = p13\n\n            Then, x1 = sqrt(p12 * p13 / p23) must be an integer.\n\n        But our condition is even stronger: we have an additional gcd condition.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be connected, so we can solve each connected component independently.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Let's define for each node i, we will store the candidate value.\n\n            We traverse the graph (each connected component) and do:\n\n                Let comp = [list of nodes in the component]\n\n                We will set one node (say the first) to a candidate value. What candidate value?\n\n                    We need to satisfy the product condition for each edge. Notice that the product of all edges in a cycle must be consistent.\n\n                Actually, we can set the first node to a value that is the product of the gcds of the edges? Not directly.\n\n            Instead, we can use the following:\n\n                Since the product condition is multiplicative, we can set the value for a node by the product of the gcds along a spanning tree? No.\n\n            Another idea: since the product condition is fixed, we can set the entire assignment by choosing a spanning tree and then fixing the values for the non-tree edges.\n\n            However, note: the product condition for an edge (u, v) is fixed: x_u * x_v = g*l. Then if we fix the value for one node, the rest are determined by the product. But we must check the gcd condition for every edge.\n\n            Algorithm for a connected component:\n\n                Step 1: Choose a root node r, and assign an arbitrary value to it. But what arbitrary value?\n\n                    We want the value to be a divisor of the product of the edge conditions. However, we don't know the primes.\n\n                Insight: the entire assignment must satisfy that for every edge (u, v): x_u * x_v = g*l. \n\n                Then, the entire assignment is determined by the ratios. But note: if we set the root to a value x_r, then for any node i, we can express x_i as (product of the reciprocals of the products of the edges along the path from the root to i) times x_r? Actually, no, because the product condition is multiplicative and the edges are bidirectional.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    Let the graph be undirected. Then, we can do a BFS/DFS and for each edge (u, v) we set:\n\n                        x_v = (g_uv * l_uv) / x_u.\n\n                But we must have that the value for v is an integer and satisfies all the gcd conditions.\n\n                However, the same node v might be reached by two different paths. Then we must ensure that the value computed by the two paths is the same.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Let's assign an array x[1..n] for the n nodes.\n\n                    We start by setting x[r] arbitrarily. But what value?\n\n                    We know that for an edge (u, v, g, l), the value of x_u must be a divisor of (g*l) (since x_v = (g*l)/x_u must be integer). But we don't know the primes.\n\n                Alternatively, we can set x[r] to a value that is the product of the gcds of all edges incident to r? No.\n\n            Another idea: notice that the product condition and the gcd condition together imply that the numbers must be divisors of the product of all the g's and l's? \n\n            However, there is a simpler way: \n\n                We know that the entire assignment must satisfy that for each edge (u, v): x_u divides (g_uv * l_uv) and x_v divides (g_uv * l_uv). But that is always true if x_u divides (g_uv * l_uv) and x_v = (g_uv * l_uv) / x_u.\n\n            But the problem is that we have multiple edges. We can set the root arbitrarily, but then the entire assignment is fixed. Then we must check:\n\n                1. For every edge, (g_uv * l_uv) is divisible by the assigned x_u (and x_v) and that the gcd(x_u, x_v) is g_uv.\n\n            However, we are free to choose the root's value. We can choose a value that is common to all the edges. \n\n            Note: the product of all edges in a cycle must be consistent. In fact, if we traverse a cycle, the product of the edge conditions (x_i * x_j) for the edges in the cycle must be such that the product of the x_i's raised to the power of the cycle's incidence (in a cycle of length k, each node appears once, so the product is the product of the x_i's for the nodes in the cycle) is the product of the edge products. But if we fix the root, then the entire assignment is fixed. The consistency condition for cycles is automatically satisfied if we use the product condition? \n\n            Actually, no: consider a cycle of three nodes (a-b-c-d-a) with edges (a,b), (b,c), (c,d), (d,a). Then the product condition for the cycle is:\n\n                (x_a * x_b) * (x_b * x_c) * (x_c * x_d) * (x_d * x_a) = (g1*l1)*(g2*l2)*(g3*l3)*(g4*l4)\n\n                and the left side is (x_a)^2 * (x_b)^2 * (x_c)^2 * (x_d)^2.\n\n                But we have no direct constraint on the individual nodes from the cycle? Actually, the assignment is fixed by the tree, so the cycle condition is redundant? \n\n            However, the problem is that the gcd condition is not captured by the product condition alone.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Build the graph.\n\n                Step 2: For each connected component, pick a root and assign a value. But what value?\n\n                    We can set the root's value to the product of the gcds of all edges? Or maybe to 1? But then the gcd condition fails.\n\n                Let's think: for an edge (u, v) with (g, l), the two numbers must be (g*a, g*b) with a*b=l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n                Then, the entire graph must have numbers that are multiples of the gcd of the edges incident to them? Not necessarily: the gcd of the entire assignment for a node might be the gcd of the gcds of the edges? \n\n                Actually, let the number for node i be x_i. Then for each edge (i, j): \n                    x_i must be divisible by g_ij, and x_j must be divisible by g_ij.\n\n                Therefore, x_i must be divisible by the gcd of all the g's of the edges incident to i? Not exactly: the gcd condition for each edge requires that g_ij divides x_i. Therefore, x_i must be divisible by the least common multiple of all the g's of the edges incident to i? Actually, no: the condition is per edge. But note: the gcd of two numbers must divide both. However, if we have two edges (i,j) and (i,k) with g1 and g2, then x_i must be divisible by both g1 and g2. Therefore, x_i must be divisible by the gcd(g1, g2)? Actually, no: it must be divisible by both g1 and g2, so by the least common multiple? Wait, no: being divisible by two numbers means divisible by their least common multiple? Actually, yes: the set of numbers divisible by g1 and g2 is the set of numbers divisible by lcm(g1, g2). But wait, no: the condition is that x_i must be divisible by g1 and by g2. The set of numbers divisible by g1 and g2 is the set of numbers divisible by lcm(g1, g2). \n\n                However, note: the gcd condition for an edge (i,j) is that the gcd(x_i, x_j)=g1. This does not require that x_i is divisible by g2 (from another edge) but it is required by the edge (i,j). But the same x_i must be divisible by every g_ij for every edge (i,j). Therefore, x_i must be divisible by the least common multiple (lcm) of all the g's of the edges incident to i? \n\n                Let me clarify: \n                    For edge (i,j): x_i must be divisible by g_ij.\n                    For edge (i,k): x_i must be divisible by g_ik.\n\n                Therefore, x_i must be divisible by the greatest common divisor? No, by the least common multiple of the set {g_ij for every edge (i,j)}. Because the set of numbers divisible by g_ij for all j is the set of numbers divisible by lcm_{j} (g_ij). \n\n                However, wait: the divisibility by g_ij for every incident edge: the condition is that x_i must be divisible by each g_ij. The set of numbers divisible by several numbers is the set of numbers divisible by the least common multiple of these numbers. \n\n                Therefore, let L_i = lcm{ g_ij for every edge (i,j) }.\n\n                Then x_i must be divisible by L_i.\n\n                Then, we can set the root's value to be the product of the L_i for the root? Or something else.\n\n            However, this is still complex.\n\n        Given the complexity, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute for each node i, the set of g's from the edges incident to i. Then, let L_i = lcm(all the g's for node i). If there are no edges, then we can set x_i arbitrarily (like 1).\n\n            Step 2: Then, for each edge (i, j, g, l), we require that L_i divides x_i and L_j divides x_j, and also x_i * x_j = g * l, and gcd(x_i, x_j)=g.\n\n            But note: the product condition and the divisibility condition are independent.\n\n            However, we can set the root's value to be the L_i for the root? Or maybe a multiple of L_i.\n\n        Actually, let's try to assign the root a value that is divisible by L_r (the lcm of the g's of the edges incident to the root). Then, the rest of the nodes will be determined by the product condition, and we must check:\n\n            - The product condition: x_j = (g*l) / x_i must be an integer and divisible by L_j (the lcm of the g's for node j).\n\n            But wait, we don't know the entire graph's constraints for node j until we assign it. However, we know L_j (from the edges incident to j). So we must have that (g*l) / x_i is divisible by L_j.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We assign the root a value that is the product of all the g's for the edges incident to the root? No.\n\n        Another idea: use the fact that the product condition and the gcd condition must hold. We can set the root to a value that is the gcd of all the edges incident to the root? No, because then the product condition might fail.\n\n        After careful thought, here's a plan:\n\n            We are going to do a BFS/DFS on the graph. We'll maintain an array x[1..n] for the candidate values.\n\n            We'll also maintain an array of divisors for each node? Or we'll check the conditions as we go.\n\n            Steps for a connected component:\n\n                Let the component have k nodes.\n\n                Let S = the set of edges in the component.\n\n                We'll pick an arbitrary node r.\n\n                We set x[r] to a value that is divisible by all the g's of the edges incident to r. But note: we don't know the entire graph, but we know the edges incident to r.\n\n                We can set x[r] to the LCM of all the g's of the edges incident to r. But wait, if there are multiple edges, then we require x[r] divisible by each g, so we can set x[r] to the LCM of all the g's. However, we also have to satisfy the product condition for each edge: for an edge (r, v) with (g, l), we have x[r] * x[v] = g * l.\n\n                Then, x[v] = (g * l) / x[r]. We must check that this is an integer and that x[v] is divisible by the LCM of the g's for node v (from the other edges incident to v).\n\n                Then, we proceed to assign the neighbors.\n\n            However, what if the root has multiple edges? Then the same x[r] must work for all edges. \n\n            Example: root r connected to v1 and v2.\n\n                For edge (r, v1): x[r] * x[v1] = g1 * l1.\n                For edge (r, v2): x[r] * x[v2] = g2 * l2.\n\n                Then, x[v1] = (g1*l1)/x[r], x[v2] = (g2*l2)/x[r].\n\n            But then, if there is an edge (v1, v2) with (g3, l3), we require:\n                x[v1] * x[v2] = g3 * l3, and gcd(x[v1], x[v2]) = g3.\n\n            But note: x[v1] and x[v2] are determined by x[r]. Then we must check that (g1*l1)*(g2*l2) = g3*l3 * (x[r]^2) ? \n\n            Actually, we don't know the edge (v1, v2) until we assign both. But we can check the product condition for the edge (v1, v2) when we assign both.\n\n            However, the problem is that the root's value must be chosen such that all divisions are exact and the gcd conditions hold.\n\n            But note: we set the root's value to L = LCM(all g's incident to r). Then, for each edge (r, v) with gcd g, we require that g divides L (because L is the LCM of the g's, so it includes g). Then, we require that (g*l) is divisible by L. But is that always true? \n\n                We know that g divides l (from the input condition). Then l = g * k, so g*l = g^2 * k.\n\n                Then, we require that L divides g^2 * k. Since L is divisible by g, we can write L = g * t. Then we require that g*t divides g^2 * k, i.e., t divides g*k.\n\n            But t is the LCM of the other g's (from the edges incident to r). There is no guarantee that t divides g*k.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily choose the root's value.\n\n        After further thought, we can do:\n\n            Since the product condition is x_i * x_j = g*l, and the gcd condition is gcd(x_i, x_j)=g, we can represent the two numbers as:\n\n                x_i = g * a, x_j = g * b, with a and b coprime and a*b = (l // g)\n\n            Then, the entire graph must be such that for each node i, the number x_i must be represented as g_i * a_i, where g_i is the gcd that we get from the edges? Actually, no: the gcd condition is per edge.\n\n            However, note: the gcd condition for an edge (i, j) is g, so the gcd of the two numbers (g_i * a_i and g_j * a_j) must be g. But wait, how did we get the representation? Actually, we don't know the global gcd for the node i. \n\n        Another approach: use the prime factorization.\n\n            For each node i, let F_i be the set of prime factors with exponents. Then, for an edge (i, j, g, l):\n\n                The product of the numbers is g*l.\n\n                The gcd is g.\n\n                Then, for each prime factor p:\n\n                    Let the exponent of p in g be e_g, in x_i be e_i, in x_j be e_j, and in l be e_l.\n\n                We know that the gcd condition: min(e_i, e_j) = e_g.\n\n                The product condition: e_i + e_j = e_l.\n\n                Then, we have:\n                    e_i >= e_g, e_j >= e_g, and min(e_i, e_j)=e_g, and e_i+e_j = e_l.\n\n                Then, without loss of generality, assume e_i <= e_j, then e_i = e_g and e_j = e_l - e_g.\n\n                But note: the gcd condition says the minimum is e_g, so one of them is e_g and the other is at least e_g. Then the sum is e_g + e_j = e_l, so e_j = e_l - e_g.\n\n                But also, we must have e_j >= e_g -> e_l - e_g >= e_g -> e_l >= 2*e_g.\n\n                And for the prime factor p, the exponent in the product g*l is: e_g + e_l = e_g + (e_i+e_j) = e_g + (e_g + e_j) = 2*e_g + e_j? Actually, wait: the product g*l = g * (g * (l/g)) but the prime factorization of g*l is the product of the prime factorizations of g and l.\n\n                Actually, the exponent of p in g*l is e_g + e_l.\n\n                But we also have from the two numbers: e_i + e_j = e_l.\n\n                And we have e_i = e_g, e_j = e_l - e_g.\n\n                Then, the exponent in g*l is e_g + e_l = e_g + (e_i+e_j) = e_g + (e_g + e_j) = 2*e_g + e_j, but that is not matching.\n\n                Let me recast: \n\n                    The two numbers are x_i and x_j, and their product is g*l.\n\n                    The gcd is g, so the common part is g.\n\n                    Then, we can write: \n                        x_i = g * a, x_j = g * b, with gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n                    Then, the product x_i*x_j = g^2 * a * b = g * l  => g * a * b = l.\n\n                    Therefore, a * b = l // g.\n\n                    Now, in terms of prime factorization for a prime p:\n\n                    Let the exponent in g be e_g, in l be e_l.\n\n                    Then, in g^2 * a * b, the exponent for p is 2*e_g + (exponent in a) + (exponent in b).\n\n                    But also, the product is g*l, so the exponent is e_g + e_l.\n\n                    Therefore: 2*e_g + (exponent in a) + (exponent in b) = e_g + e_l  => e_g + (exponent in a) + (exponent in b) = e_l.\n\n                    But we also have that a and b are coprime, so for prime p, either a has exponent 0 or b has exponent 0.\n\n                    Now, the gcd condition: the exponent in x_i and x_j for p is e_g + (exponent in a) for x_i and e_g + (exponent in b) for x_j.\n\n                    The gcd takes the minimum of the two exponents, which should be e_g.\n\n                    So for x_i and x_j, the exponent for p is (e_g + a_exp) and (e_g + b_exp). The minimum is e_g + min(a_exp, b_exp). But we require that to be e_g, so min(a_exp, b_exp) must be 0.\n\n                    That is: for the prime p, either a has exponent 0 or b has exponent 0.\n\n                    And from the product condition for the exponents: a_exp + b_exp = e_l - e_g.\n\n                    And from the gcd condition: one of a_exp or b_exp is 0.\n\n                    Therefore, we must have: either a_exp = 0 and b_exp = e_l - e_g, or a_exp = e_l - e_g and b_exp = 0.\n\n                    But wait, the condition is that a and b are coprime, so for each prime p, only one of a or b can have a positive exponent. \n\n            Therefore, the entire assignment for the graph is determined by the prime factorizations.\n\n            But the problem is to find any assignment.\n\n            Steps for a connected component:\n\n                We can factorize the product of all the g's and l's? But the product might be huge.\n\n            Given the complexity and constraints (n, m up to 10^5, and g, l up to 10^6), we cannot factorize everything.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again, note that the numbers on the roads were no less than 1 and did not exceed 10^6.\n\n        We can try to use a different approach: \n\n            For each edge, we know that the two numbers must be divisors of (g*l) and their gcd is g. \n\n            We can precompute for each edge the set of candidates for the two nodes. But the number of divisors of g*l can be large (up to around 10^5 or more) and we have up to 10^5 edges, which is too many.\n\n        I think the intended solution is to use the product condition and the gcd condition to derive the necessary conditions and then check consistency.\n\n        Here's a simpler idea:\n\n            From the product condition: x_i * x_j = g*l for an edge (i, j).\n\n            From the gcd condition: gcd(x_i, x_j) = g.\n\n            Then, we can write: \n                x_i = g * a, x_j = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = l//g.\n\n            Now, consider two adjacent edges (i, j) and (i, k). Then for edge (i, j): a1 * b1 = l1//g1, and for (i, k): a2 * b2 = l2//g2.\n\n            And x_i = g1 * a1 = g2 * a2.\n\n            Then, we have: g1 * a1 = g2 * a2.\n\n            And a1 and a2 must be chosen from the factors of l1//g1 and l2//g2 respectively, and be coprime with their corresponding b.\n\n            But note: the entire assignment must be consistent.\n\n        Given the time constraints, I decide to use the following method:\n\n            We'll treat the graph as a system of equations in the logs? But that doesn't give integers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let the entire graph be connected. Then, the assignment is determined by the product condition up to a scalar multiple. But note: the gcd condition fixes the scale.\n\n            Specifically, if we fix the value for one node, the others are fixed by the product condition. Then, we can try to set the value for the root to a specific value and then check all the gcd conditions.\n\n            But what value to set for the root? We can set it to the product of the gcds of the edges incident to the root? No.\n\n            We can set the root's value to 1, and then see if we can adjust the entire assignment by a common factor. But then the gcd condition might not hold.\n\n        However, note: the product condition is multiplicative, and the gcd condition is also multiplicative. If we find an assignment (x_i) that satisfies the product condition and the gcd condition for all edges, then multiplying all the numbers by a constant k would change the product condition: the new product would be k^2 * (old product) and the gcd would be k * (old gcd). So the conditions would not hold unless k=1.\n\n        Therefore, the assignment is essentially unique up to the product condition and gcd condition.\n\n        But wait: the product condition and the gcd condition might",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (vertex) in a graph based on the given roads (edges), where each edge specifies the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. The solution involves verifying the consistency of these conditions across all edges and assigning values to each vertex if feasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to assign integer values to each vertex such that for every edge connecting two vertices, the product of their values equals the product of the GCD and LCM provided for that edge, and their GCD matches the specified value. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For any edge with GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the product of the two connected vertex values must be `g * l`. Additionally, the GCD of these two values must be exactly `g`. This implies that the values can be expressed as `g * a` and `g * b`, where `a` and `b` are coprime integers whose product is `l / g`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Graph Traversal**: We use BFS or DFS to traverse the graph, assigning values to vertices based on the constraints from adjacent edges.\n   - **Consistency Check**: For each edge, after assigning values to its vertices, verify that their product is `g * l` and their GCD is `g`.\n   - **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: The graph may consist of multiple connected components, each handled independently.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves traversing each edge and vertex once, making the time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.
