Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap in the middle is (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be lit. The idea is to compute the maximum of the necessary coverage in each segment.\n\n But wait: the lanterns can have a radius d that lights from (a_i - d) to (a_i + d). Therefore, to cover the entire street, we need:\n\n   d must be at least (max( a[0] - 0, l - a[-1] )) / 2\n\n However, what about the gaps between lanterns? In the gap between two lanterns, the worst-case point is the midpoint. The distance from the midpoint to the nearest lantern (either one) is (gap)/2. So we require d to be at least (gap)/2 for every gap. \n\n Actually, we can break the problem into:\n   Let the sorted lanterns be a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}\n\n   Condition 1: The leftmost segment [0, a0]: the farthest unlit point from the first lantern is 0, so we need d >= a0/2 to light 0.\n   Condition 2: The rightmost segment [a_{n-1}, l]: the farthest unlit point is l, so we need d >= (l - a_{n-1})/2.\n\n   Condition 3: For the gaps between consecutive lanterns: for i from 0 to n-2, the gap between a_i and a_{i+1} is (a_{i+1} - a_i). The maximum gap that must be covered by a single lantern is half of that gap? Actually, if we have two lanterns, then the entire gap is covered if d is at least (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2? But note: if we set d to be (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2, then the left lantern covers up to a_i + d = a_i + (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d = a_{i+1} - (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2. The point between is covered because the left lantern goes to the midpoint and the right lantern starts from the other side? Actually, the condition is that the two lanterns together must cover the entire gap. The requirement is that the two lanterns' coverage must meet or overlap. The minimum d needed for the gap is (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2. However, note that we don't necessarily have to use both for the entire gap: actually, the entire gap is from a_i to a_{i+1}. The left lantern must cover up to at least a_{i+1} or the right lantern must cover from at least a_i, but they are independent. The minimal d such that the entire gap is covered is (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2. Because if we set d to that, then the left lantern extends to a_i + (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2 and the right lantern extends to a_{i+1} - (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2, and these two meet at the midpoint.\n\n However, note that the lanterns can also extend beyond their neighbors. But the key is: the entire street must be covered. So the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n\n   candidate1 = a0 / 2.0   (to cover from 0 to a0)\n   candidate2 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0   (to cover from a[-1] to l)\n\n   candidate3 = max(0, (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0) for all i from 0 to n-2, but note: if two lanterns are adjacent, then the gap is 0, so no problem.\n\n However, wait: is that correct? Consider two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The entire segment [x, y] must be covered. The left lantern covers from x-d to x+d, and the right lantern from y-d to y+d. To have no gap, we require x+d >= y-d, which implies d >= (y-x)/2. And also, we must have d >= (x - 0)/2 (if x is the first) and d >= (l-y)/2 (if y is the last). But note: the same d must be used for all lanterns.\n\n So the answer is the maximum of:\n   candidate1 = a0 / 2.0\n   candidate2 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0\n   candidate3 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 ) for i in range(n-1)\n\n However, consider an example: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   Then: \n        candidate1 = 2/2 = 1.0\n        candidate2 = (5-5)/2 = 0\n        candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n   Then the maximum is 1.5, but the expected output is 2.0.\n\n Why 2.0? Let me explain: \n   With d=1.5, the first lantern at 2 covers [0.5, 3.5] and the second at 5 covers [3.5, 6.5]. The entire street [0,5] is covered? Wait, 0 to 5: \n        From 0 to 0.5: not covered by the first lantern (since 0.5 is the start of the first lantern's coverage) but wait, the first lantern is at 2 with d=1.5: it goes from 2-1.5=0.5 to 2+1.5=3.5. Then from 0 to 0.5 is not covered. \n\n But wait, the problem says: the lantern lights all points at distance at most d. So the first lantern at 2 with d=1.5 does not cover 0. So we need d>= (2-0)/2 = 1.0 for the left, but also the gap between 2 and 5 requires d>= (5-2)/2=1.5. However, with d=1.5, the left part (from 0 to 0.5) is still not covered. \n\n Actually, the condition for the left part is that the first lantern must cover 0. That requires 2 - d <= 0 -> d>=2. Similarly, for the right part, the last lantern must cover l (which is 5): 5 + d >= 5 -> d>=0, but wait, the last lantern is at 5, so to cover the end (point 5) we require d>=0. However, the entire street must be covered. The issue is the left end.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire street as being covered by the union of intervals. The leftmost interval must extend from 0 to at least the first lantern's coverage, so the first lantern must have d >= (first lantern position) to cover the start? Not exactly: the first lantern at position a0 covers from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. But wait, that would be too strong: because if d is set to a0, then the leftmost point 0 is covered. However, we can set d to be a0/2 and then the coverage of the first lantern is from 0 to a0+a0/2. But wait, if d = a0/2, then the left edge is at a0-d = a0/2, so 0 is not covered.\n\n Correction: To cover 0, the first lantern must have d at least a0 (so that the left edge is 0). Or wait, no: the condition is that the left edge of the first lantern's coverage is a0-d. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. Similarly, for the last lantern, we require d >= l - a_{n-1}. \n\n But wait, that would give:\n   Example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        candidate1 = 2 (because d>=2 to cover 0)\n        candidate2 = 0 (because d>=0 to cover 5)\n        candidate3 = 1.5\n\n Then the answer would be 2.0, which matches the sample.\n\n However, let's test the first sample: \n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n        First, sort: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n        candidate1: d >= 0 (because the first lantern is at 0, so to cover 0 we need d>=0) -> 0\n        candidate2: d >= 15-15 = 0 -> 0\n        candidate3: the gaps: \n            3-0 = 3 -> 1.5\n            5-3 = 2 -> 1.0\n            7-5 = 2 -> 1.0\n            9-7 = 2 -> 1.0\n            14-9 = 5 -> 2.5\n            15-14 = 1 -> 0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        The expected output is 2.5, so that matches.\n\n But wait, why did the initial reasoning for the left and right use division by 2? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n In the corrected view:\n   To cover the left end (0), the first lantern at a0 must have d at least a0 (so that the left edge a0-d <= 0). \n   Similarly, the last lantern at a_{n-1} must have d at least (l - a_{n-1]) (so that the right edge a_{n-1]+d >= l).\n\n   Now, what about the gaps between lanterns? Consider two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}. The entire gap between them must be covered. The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which gives 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i -> d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n However, note: if we set d to be the maximum of:\n        d1 = a0   [to cover the left end]\n        d2 = (l - a_{n-1])\n        d3 = (max_gap_between_lanterns) / 2\n\n Then the answer would be max(d1, d2, d3). \n\n But wait: in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", \n        d1 = 2 (from the first lantern to cover 0: we require d>=2 so that 2-d<=0 -> d>=2)\n        d2 = 0 (from the last lantern: 5 is at the end, so no extra needed on the right)\n        d3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n Then the answer is 2.0.\n\n However, is d=2 sufficient?\n        First lantern at 2: covers [0,4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n        Second lantern at 5: covers [3,7] (5-2=3, 5+2=7)\n\n        The entire street is [0,5]. The point 4.5 is not covered by the first lantern (only up to 4) and the second lantern starts at 3 (so 4.5 is covered by the second lantern). But wait, the first lantern's coverage goes to 4, so 4.5 is beyond 4. However, the second lantern starts at 3, so from 3 to 7, so 4.5 is covered. \n\n        But what about the point 5? The second lantern's coverage is 5-2=3 to 5+2=7, so 5 is covered.\n\n        However, the entire street is from 0 to 5. We have:\n          [0,4] from the first lantern, and [3,7] from the second. The union is [0,7] which covers [0,5]. \n\n        But note: the condition for the gap between 2 and 5 is that the two lanterns must meet. The first lantern covers up to 4, the second starts at 3. So there's an overlap from 3 to 4, and the entire street is covered.\n\n        But wait, the requirement for the gap is that the two lanterns must meet or overlap. The condition for meeting is that the left lantern's right end (a_i+d) must be at least the right lantern's left end (a_{i+1}-d). In our case: 2+2=4 and 5-2=3 -> 4>=3, so yes.\n\n        However, note that the condition for the left end was d>=2, and the condition for the gap was d>=1.5, so the overall d must be at least 2.\n\n        Now, let's check with the first sample: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15] and d=2.5.\n\n        Left end: first lantern at 0, so 0-d = -2.5, which is less than 0 -> covers 0.\n        Last lantern at 15: 15+2.5=17.5 >=15 -> covers the end.\n\n        Now the gaps:\n          Gap from 0 to 3: first lantern at 0 covers up to 0+2.5=2.5, and the next lantern at 3: 3-2.5=0.5. So the gap from 0 to 3 is covered? \n          The first lantern covers [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5] and the next lantern covers [0.5, 5.5]. The entire street from 0 to 3 is covered because from 0 to 2.5 by the first and from 2.5 to 3 by the second? Actually, the second lantern starts at 0.5, so from 0.5 to 3 is covered by the second, but what about 2.5 to 0.5? The first lantern only goes to 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 0.5. The point 2.6 is not covered by the first (because 2.6>2.5) and not by the second (because 2.6<3-2.5=0.5? No, wait: the second lantern is at 3, so its coverage is [3-2.5, 3+2.5] = [0.5,5.5]. So 2.6 is in [0.5,5.5] -> covered.\n\n        But wait, the gap between 0 and 3 is from 0 to 3. The first lantern covers up to 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 0.5. The entire gap is covered because the first lantern covers [0,2.5] and the second covers [0.5,5.5] so together [0,5.5] covers [0,3]. \n\n        However, the critical gap is between 9 and 14: \n          The gap length is 5, so we require d>=5/2=2.5. So we set d=2.5, then the left lantern at 9 covers up to 9+2.5=11.5, and the right lantern at 14 covers from 14-2.5=11.5. So they meet exactly at 11.5.\n\n        Therefore, the conditions are:\n          d must be at least the maximum of:\n            a0 (to cover the left end)\n            l - a_{n-1} (to cover the right end)\n            (max_gap_between_consecutive_lanterns)/2 (to cover the gaps between lanterns)\n\n        But wait: in the left end, we require d>=a0. However, consider if we have a lantern at 0, then we don't need to cover the left end beyond 0. Similarly, if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition for the left end is 0 (since 0-d<=0 for any d>=0). \n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. The first lantern is at a0. The coverage is [a0-d, a0+d]. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. But if a0==0, then d>=0, which is always true. \n\n        Similarly, for the right end: d>= (l - a_{n-1]).\n\n        And for the gaps: d>= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of these three values.\n\n        However, let me test with the example: \"1 5\\n3\" (one lantern at 3 in a street of length 5)\n\n        Conditions:\n          left: d>=3 (to cover 0: 3-d<=0 -> d>=3)\n          right: d>=5-3=2 (to cover 5: 3+d>=5 -> d>=2)\n          gaps: none (n=1)\n\n        Then d = max(3,2) = 3.\n\n        Now, with d=3, the lantern at 3 covers [0,6] which covers [0,5]. Correct.\n\n        Another example: \"3 10\\n2 5 8\"\n\n        Conditions:\n          left: d>=2\n          right: d>=10-8=2\n          gaps: \n            gap1: (5-2)=3 -> d>=1.5\n            gap2: (8-5)=3 -> d>=1.5\n\n        Then d = max(2,2,1.5)=2.\n\n        Check: \n          Lantern at 2: [0,4] (since 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n          Lantern at 5: [3,7]\n          Lantern at 8: [6,10]\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n          [0,4] from first, [3,7] from second, [6,10] from third.\n          The gaps: from 4 to 3? Actually, from 4 to 3 doesn't exist. The first lantern ends at 4, the second starts at 3 (so 3 to 4 is covered by the second). Then from 4 to 6: the second lantern goes to 7, so [3,7] covers [4,7] and the third starts at 6 (which is within [4,7]). So yes.\n\n        But wait, the second lantern covers [3,7] and the third lantern covers [6,10]. The gap between the second and third is from 7 to 6? Actually, the second lantern goes to 7, and the third starts at 6. So the entire street is covered.\n\n        However, note that the condition for the gap between 5 and 8: we required d>=1.5, and we set d=2 (which is >=1.5). \n\n        But wait, the condition for the left end was d>=2, and the condition for the right end was d>=2. \n\n        This approach seems to work.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is d>=a0, but what if we have multiple lanterns? Actually, the condition for the left end is only the first lantern. Similarly for the right end.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and l.\n        Step 2: Read the list of lantern positions and sort it.\n        Step 3: \n            d_left = arr[0]   # because the first lantern must cover from 0 to arr[0], so d>=arr[0]\n            d_right = l - arr[-1]   # because the last lantern must cover from arr[-1] to l, so d>= (l - arr[-1])\n\n        Step 4: For the gaps between consecutive lanterns, we compute the maximum gap (a[i+1]-a[i]), and then the required d for that gap is (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        Step 5: Then the answer is the maximum of d_left, d_right, and the maximum gap/2.\n\n        However, wait: is the condition for the left end really d>=arr[0]? Let me reexamine:\n\n        The first lantern is at arr[0]. The coverage is [arr[0]-d, arr[0]+d]. To cover the left end (0), we require arr[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=arr[0]. \n\n        Similarly, the last lantern is at arr[-1], and to cover the right end (l), we require arr[-1]+d >= l -> d>=l-arr[-1].\n\n        But note: the entire street is from 0 to l. We must cover 0 and l.\n\n        However, what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then d>=0, which is fine.\n\n        Also, what if there are multiple lanterns? The condition for the left end is independent of the rest.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we have to cover the entire street from 0 to l with one lantern.\n        # Then the lantern must be placed such that it covers both ends. But wait, the problem allows multiple lanterns, but in the case of one lantern, we have only one.\n\n        # Conditions:\n        d_left = a[0]   # to cover from 0 to the first lantern\n        d_right = l - a[-1]  # to cover from the last lantern to l\n\n        # Now, the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        max_gap_half = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n            if gap/2.0 > max_gap_half:\n                max_gap_half = gap/2.0\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, max_gap_half)\n\n        Print ans with formatting to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, wait: what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then d_left is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly for the last.\n\n        But note: what if the first lantern is at position x (x>0)? Then we require d>=x. Similarly, if the last lantern is at y (y<l), then d>=l-y.\n\n        Example: n=0? The problem states n>=1.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d_left=0, and the condition is satisfied for any d>=0.\n\n        However, we must consider the entire street. The above method considers the left end and the right end separately and the gaps in between.\n\n        However, let me test with a different example: \n          Input: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n\n          Conditions:\n            d_left = 0\n            d_right = 0\n            gaps: \n                gap1: 5-0=5 -> 2.5\n                gap2: 10-5=5 -> 2.5\n\n            Then ans = 2.5\n\n            Check: \n                Lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so 0 to 2.5 is covered.\n                Lantern at 5: covers [2.5, 7.5]\n                Lantern at 10: covers [7.5, 12.5]\n\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        Another example: \n          Input: \"3 10\\n1 2 9\"\n\n          Conditions:\n            d_left = 1\n            d_right = 1\n            gaps: \n                gap1: 2-1=1 -> 0.5\n                gap2: 9-2=7 -> 3.5\n\n            Then ans = 3.5\n\n            Check: \n                First lantern at 1: covers [1-3.5, 1+3.5] = [-2.5,4.5] -> covers [0,4.5] (since 0>=-2.5)\n                Second lantern at 2: covers [2-3.5, 2+3.5] = [-1.5,5.5] -> covers [0,5.5]\n                Third lantern at 9: covers [9-3.5,9+3.5]=[5.5,12.5] -> covers [5.5,10]\n\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But wait, is 3.5 the minimal? \n            Without the first lantern, the gap from 1 to 2 requires d>=0.5, but the gap from 2 to 9 requires d>= (9-2)/2 = 3.5. Also, the left end requires d>=1. The right end requires d>=1. So 3.5 is the maximum.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is d>=1, and the gap condition for the largest gap is 3.5, so the minimal d is 3.5.\n\n        But wait, what if we set d=3.5? Then the first lantern covers [1-3.5, 1+3.5]=[-2.5,4.5] and the second lantern [2-3.5,2+3.5]=[-1.5,5.5] and the third [5.5,12.5]. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But is there a way to use a smaller d? Suppose d=3.4, then the third lantern covers [5.6,12.4] and the second lantern covers [2-3.4,2+3.4]=[-1.4,5.4]. Then the third lantern does not cover 5.4 to 5.6? Actually, the second lantern's coverage goes to 5.4, and the third lantern starts at 5.6. The point 5.5 is not covered. So 3.4 is insufficient.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is 3.5.\n\n        However, note that the above reasoning for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. With d=3.5, the first lantern covers from -2.5 to 4.5, so 0 is covered. Similarly, the right end is covered by the third lantern.\n\n        But wait, the condition for the left end was d>=1, but 3.5 is more than 1, so that's okay.\n\n        However, what if we set d=3.5, then the first lantern is covering from -2.5 to 4.5, but the entire street is [0,10]. The first lantern is at 1, so we don't need to cover the negative part. But the condition d>=1 is just the minimal to cover the left end (0). \n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          # If there's only one lantern, then we have to cover the entire street from 0 to l with one lantern.\n          # But note: the lantern might not be at the center. Then we require d>= max(a[0], l-a[-1])\n\n          # However, the above conditions still hold.\n\n          d_left = a[0]  # to cover from 0 to the first lantern\n          d_right = l - a[-1]  # to cover from the last lantern to l\n\n          # Now, for the gaps, we consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n          max_mid_gap = 0.0\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n              # The minimal d for this gap is gap/2.0. But note: if we set d to gap/2.0, then the two lanterns will meet at the midpoint.\n              # However, we are taking the maximum over these gaps, so we need the maximum of gap/2.0 for all gaps.\n              if gap > 0:   # avoid zero gap, but even if gap==0, it's 0 so doesn't matter\n                  mid_gap = gap / 2.0\n                  if mid_gap > max_mid_gap:\n                      max_mid_gap = mid_gap\n\n          # But wait, what if the street has no gaps? Then max_mid_gap remains 0.0.\n\n          ans = max(d_left, d_right, max_mid_gap)\n\n        However, wait: what if the first lantern is at 0, then d_left=0. Then the condition for the left end is 0, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the condition for the gaps is independent. \n\n        However, I just realized: the condition for the gaps is that the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. But note: the entire street must be covered. The gaps between lanterns are automatically covered if the lanterns are spaced appropriately. The condition for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is that the two lanterns together must cover the entire segment [a_i, a_{i+1}]. The minimal d that satisfies that gap is (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2. \n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is d>=a0, which is the same as saying the first lantern must extend to the left to 0. Similarly, the condition for the right end is d>=l-a_{n-1}. \n\n        But wait, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street by themselves? For example, if we have two lanterns at 0 and 10 for a street of length 10, then d_left=0, d_right=0, and the gap is 10, so d>=5. Then the entire street is covered because the first lantern covers [-5,5] and the second [5,15] so they meet at 5.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the gap is (10-0)/2=5, so d>=5.\n\n        But wait, the condition for the left end is d>=0, which is satisfied by 5.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the maximum of these three.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a lantern that is not at the beginning or end, and the gaps are large, but the ends are not too bad? Then the gaps might require a larger d.\n\n        However, we must cover the entire street. The above conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\n        But wait: what if the first lantern is not at 0 and the gap from 0 to the first lantern is large, but the gaps between lanterns are small? Then the left end condition (d>=a0) might be the biggest.\n\n        Example: \n          n=2, l=10, lanterns at [3,7]\n          Conditions:\n            d_left = 3\n            d_right = 10-7=3\n            gap = 7-3=4 -> gap/2=2\n            Then ans = 3.\n\n        Check: \n          First lantern: [3-3,3+3] = [0,6] -> covers 0 to 6.\n          Second lantern: [7-3,7+3] = [4,10] -> covers 4 to 10.\n          The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        However, is 3 the minimal? \n          What if d=2.9? \n          First lantern: [0.1,5.9] -> does not cover 0 (because 0.1>0) -> fails.\n\n        So 3 is indeed the minimal.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Edge case: if n==0, but n>=1 per problem.\n\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        max_mid = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The gap is the distance between consecutive lanterns. The minimal d to cover this gap is gap/2.0.\n            # But note: if we set d to gap/2.0, then the left lantern covers from a[i-1] to a[i-1]+gap/2.0, and the right lantern from a[i]-gap/2.0 to a[i]. We require a[i-1]+gap/2.0 >= a[i]-gap/2.0 -> which is gap/2.0*2 = gap, so condition holds.\n            # However, we are going to take the maximum of all these, so we just need the maximum gap/2.0.\n            if gap % 2 != 0:\n                # It's float anyway, but we can do integer or float without problem.\n                pass\n            mid_val = gap / 2.0\n            if mid_val > max_mid:\n                max_mid = mid_val\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, max_mid)\n\n        But wait, there's a catch: what if the entire street is covered by the lanterns without needing to extend beyond the first or last? \n\n        However, the above conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\n        However, note: the above conditions are derived from the necessary conditions for the ends and the gaps. \n\n        But wait, the condition for the left end: d>=a0. Is that correct? \n            The first lantern is at a0. The leftmost point is 0. The lantern covers from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n        Similarly, for the right end: d>=l-a_{n-1}.\n\n        And for the gaps: d must be at least (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for every consecutive pair.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the maximum of these.\n\n        However, wait: what if the first lantern is not the only one to cover the left end? Actually, the entire street must be covered. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least its own coverage. But note, if we have multiple lanterns, the first lantern might not be the only one that covers the left end? Actually, the left end is 0, and the first lantern is the one closest to 0. Any lantern to the right of the first won't help in covering 0. So the first lantern must cover 0.\n\n        Similarly, the last lantern must cover l.\n\n        Therefore, the conditions are correct.\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n          d_left = 0\n          d_right = 15-15=0\n          gaps: \n            3-0=3 -> 1.5\n            5-3=2 -> 1.0\n            7-5=2 -> 1.0\n            9-7=2 -> 1.0\n            14-9=5 -> 2.5\n            15-14=1 -> 0.5\n          Then max_mid = 2.5\n          ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n          Sorted: [2,5]\n          d_left=2, d_right=0, gaps= (5-2)=3 -> 1.5\n          ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2 -> matches.\n\n        But wait, the example output was '2.5000000000' for the first and '2.0000000000' for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, and each lantern at position `a_i` lights all points within a distance `d` from it. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check End Conditions**: The leftmost point (0) must be covered by the first lantern, which requires `d` to be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (`a[0]`). Similarly, the rightmost point (`l`) must be covered by the last lantern, requiring `d` to be at least the distance from the end of the street to the last lantern (`l - a[-1]`).\n3. **Check Gap Conditions**: For the segments between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between any two adjacent lanterns dictates the minimal `d` needed to ensure these segments are fully covered. Specifically, for a gap between two lanterns at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, the minimal `d` required is `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.\n4. **Determine the Minimal `d`**: The overall minimal `d` is the maximum value among the three conditions mentioned above—coverage of the left end, coverage of the right end, and coverage of the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    d_left = a[0]\n    d_right = l - a[-1]\n    max_mid = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        mid_val = gap / 2.0\n        if mid_val > max_mid:\n            max_mid = mid_val\n            \n    ans = max(d_left, d_right, max_mid)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order from left to right.\n3. **Left and Right Coverage**: The minimal `d` required to cover the left end (0) is the position of the first lantern (`a[0]`), and the minimal `d` to cover the right end (`l`) is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l - a[-1]`).\n4. **Gap Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the midpoint between them is calculated. The minimal `d` needed to cover the segment between them is half the distance between them. The largest such value across all gaps is stored in `max_mid`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value among `d_left`, `d_right`, and `max_mid`, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine the minimal light radius required, ensuring the entire street is covered by the lanterns' illumination.",
