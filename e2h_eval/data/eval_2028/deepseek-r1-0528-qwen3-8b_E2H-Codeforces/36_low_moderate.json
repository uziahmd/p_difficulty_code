The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000) and we have n+2 towns: 0, 1, ..., n+1.\n We build a tower in each town i (from 1 to n) with probability 1/2, independently.\n\n Conditions for the signal powers:\n   - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n   - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one tower.\n\n Note: The signal from a tower at town i with power p reaches all cities c such that |c-i| < p.\n\n Observation:\n   Let S be the set of towns (from 1 to n) where a tower is built.\n\n   For a town j (in {1,...,n}) to get exactly one signal, note that the signal must come from a tower at some town i (which is built) such that:\n        |j - i| < p   (with p being the signal power of the tower at i)\n\n   But note: the problem also requires that towns 0 and n+1 do not get any signal. This imposes conditions on the towers.\n\n   Moreover, we can choose the signal powers arbitrarily (each independently from 1 to n) for the built towers.\n\n   The key is: we must assign a signal power to each built tower such that:\n        Each town j in [1, n] is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n   How can we cover the towns? Note that the coverage condition is:\n\n        For a built tower at i, it covers an interval (i-p, i+p). But note: the condition is strict: |c-i| < p, so the interval is open.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not require the same signal power for all towers. We are free to choose.\n\n   But we must also ensure that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n   Conditions for town 0: \n        It should not be covered by any tower i (built or not). So for every built tower i, we must have: p_i <= i (since |0-i| = i, so we need i < p_i to cover town 0, but then we must avoid that). Actually, to not cover town 0, we must have that the left side of the tower's coverage does not extend to 0: i - p_i + 1 > 0? Actually, the condition is |0-i| >= p_i, i.e., i >= p_i (because i is positive). Similarly, for town n+1: we require that for every built tower i, |n+1 - i| >= p_i, i.e., n+1 - i >= p_i.\n\n   However, note: the problem allows us to choose the signal powers arbitrarily (from 1 to n). So for a fixed set S, we must check if there exists an assignment of powers (one per tower) such that:\n\n        1. For each town j in [1, n]: there is exactly one tower i in S (possibly multiple candidates) such that |j-i| < p_i.\n        2. For every built tower i: p_i <= i (so that town 0 is not reached) and p_i <= n+1-i (so that town n+1 is not reached).\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the same tower cannot cover two different towns? Actually, condition is that each town gets exactly one. So we require that the coverage of the towers (with chosen powers) forms a partition of the set {1,2,...,n}.\n\n   Also note: the coverage of a tower at i is the interval (i-p_i, i+p_i) intersected with integers. Since the condition is |c-i| < p_i, then the coverage of tower i is the set of integers from floor(i-p_i+1) to ceil(i+p_i-1)? Actually, we are working on integer coordinates.\n\n        Condition for a town j to be covered by tower i: |j-i| < p_i   <=>   j is in (i-p_i, i+p_i) (as real numbers) and then we take the integer points inside.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"signal power from 1 to n\", so p_i is at least 1 and at most n.\n\n   Now, what are the constraints on p_i?\n\n        For a tower at i, we must have p_i <= i (to avoid covering 0) and p_i <= n+1-i (to avoid covering n+1). Therefore, the maximum allowed power for a tower at i is min(i, n+1-i).\n\n   But note: we are free to choose any integer from 1 to n, but if we choose a power greater than min(i, n+1-i), then we would cover either town 0 or",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, we can assign signal powers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Towns Coverage**: A tower at position `i` with power `p` covers towns `c` where `|c - i| < p`. This means the coverage interval for the tower is `(i - p, i + p)`.\n   - **Constraints**: \n     - Towns 0 and `n+1` must not be covered by any tower. This implies that for any tower at position `i`, its power `p` must satisfy `p ≤ i` (to avoid covering town 0) and `p ≤ n+1 - i` (to avoid covering town `n+1`). Thus, the maximum allowable power for a tower at `i` is `min(i, n+1 - i)`.\n     - Each town from 1 to `n` must be covered by exactly one tower. This requires that the coverage intervals of the towers do not overlap in a way that any town is covered by more than one tower or left uncovered.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The problem reduces to selecting a subset of towns (from 1 to `n`) where each selected town `i` must have a power `p_i` such that `1 ≤ p_i ≤ min(i, n+1 - i)`. Additionally, the union of the coverage intervals of these towers must exactly cover towns 1 through `n` without overlapping.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid subsets of towns. The DP state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to cover towns up to position `i` using towers from positions 1 to `i`.\n   - The recurrence relation considers two cases for each town `i`:\n     - **Not Building a Tower**: The coverage up to `i` remains the same as up to `i-1`.\n     - **Building a Tower**: If we build a tower at `i`, we must ensure that it does not cover towns beyond `i` (due to the constraint `p_i ≤ min(i, n+1 - i)`). The coverage starts from `i - p_i + 1` to `i + p_i - 1`. The DP transition involves finding the leftmost town that needs to be covered by this tower.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The total number of valid subsets is given by `dp[n+1]`. Since each town is built with probability 1/2, the probability is `(dp[n+1] * pow(2, -(n+1), 998244353)) % 998244353`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 2):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        if i > 1:\n            max_p = min(i - 1, n + 1 - i)\n            if max_p == 0:\n                continue\n            j = i - 1\n            while j >= 1 and dp[j - 1] == 0:\n                j -= 1\n            if j >= 1:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD\n    \n    total_subsets = dp[n + 1]\n    inv_two = pow(2, n + 1, MOD)\n    inv_total = pow(inv_two, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    ans = (total_subsets * inv_total) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` to handle the base case where no towns are considered initially.\n2. **DP Transition**: For each town `i` from 1 to `n+1`, the DP value is updated by considering both building and not building a tower at `i`. If a tower is built, the maximum allowable power is `min(i-1, n+1-i)`, and the coverage starts from `j` (determined by the leftmost town needing coverage).\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The total number of valid subsets is found in `dp[n+1]`. The probability is computed by multiplying this count by the modular inverse of `2^(n+1)` modulo `998244353`, ensuring the result is within the required modulus.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations using dynamic programming and computes the probability by leveraging modular arithmetic for large numbers.",
