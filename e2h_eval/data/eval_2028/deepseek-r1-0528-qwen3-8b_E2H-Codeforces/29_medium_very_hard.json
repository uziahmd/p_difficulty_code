Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with a problem that requires processing up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 characters.\n The challenge: We have to replace every occurrence of a digit (from '0' to '9') with a string (which can be empty) in a sequence of queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order, but if we do naive replacement (like replacing all '2' in \"123123\" with \"00\", then the next query replaces '3' with \"\"), we might need to consider that after replacing '2', the resulting string now has digits that were originally from other digits? But wait: the problem says that the queries are performed in order. \n\n Important: The problem does not say that the replacements are done simultaneously. They are sequential. However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\"\n   Output: \"10031003\"\n\n Then the next example: \n   Input: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n   Output: \"1212\"\n\n But then the third sample:\n   Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n   Output: \"777\"\n\n How to process?\n   If we do the first query: \"2->0\", then the string \"222\" becomes \"000\". Then the second query: \"0->7\", so we replace every '0' in \"000\" by \"7\", so we get \"777\".\n\n However, if we do the replacements sequentially, we must note that the same digit might appear again after a replacement? Actually, the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\".\n\n But note: the queries are independent and the replacements are done for each digit at the time of the query. However, the problem states that the queries are performed in the order given, and each query operates on the current string.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: what if a replacement introduces a digit that was the subject of a previous query? For example, the third sample: \n   Start with \"222\"\n   Query1: replace '2' with '0' -> \"000\"\n   Query2: replace '0' with '7' -> \"777\"\n\n So the replacement in the first query produces zeros, and then the second query replaces zeros. \n\n However, the problem is that the total length of the string can grow exponentially? Because if we replace a digit with a string of length L, then the entire string gets longer. And we have up to 10^5 queries and the sum of lengths of ti is 10^5, but note: the same digit might be replaced multiple times (in different queries) and also the replacement in one query might affect the next.\n\n But note: the input constraint says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, the intermediate strings can become very long. We cannot build the entire string because the length might be astronomical.\n\n Alternative approach: We are only interested in the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n Also note: the problem says to ignore leading zeros when representing as a decimal number, but note: the example outputs do not remove the leading zeros during the representation? Actually, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero\".\n\n However, note: the example output for the first sample is \"10031003\", which has leading zeros? Actually, no: the example input \"123123\" becomes \"10031003\" after replacing '2' with '00'. But note: the first character is '1', so no leading zeros. However, consider if we had a string that starts with zeros. For example, if we start with \"000\" and then do a replacement that removes zeros, we get an empty string which is considered 0.\n\n But wait: the problem says that when representing s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. However, the entire string is being built and then interpreted as a decimal number. \n\n However, the catch: if we have a very long string, we cannot build the entire string. We must compute the number modulo 1000000007 without building the entire string.\n\n How?\n\n Observation: The operations are sequential. Each operation replaces every occurrence of a digit d with a string t. But note: we are going to apply the queries in order, so the last query will be the most recent transformation.\n\n But the problem: the queries are applied from first to last. However, the later queries can refer to digits that were introduced by earlier replacements. This suggests that we might need to process the queries backwards? \n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire transformation as a function that maps the original string to the final string. However, the exponential growth in length is too much.\n\n Another idea: we are only interested in the numeric value mod 1000000007. Also, note that the numeric value is computed from the string as:\n\n   num = 0\n   for char in s:\n        num = (num * 10 + int(char)) % mod\n\n But if we transform the string, we break this down. However, the transformation may insert multiple digits in place of one.\n\n Let's denote the transformation as a series of steps. Suppose we have a list of transformations. We cannot apply them one by one because the string becomes too long.\n\n Insight: We can use dynamic programming or state machines that keep track of the value and the length of the string, but the state would be the entire string and that is too expensive.\n\n Alternate Insight: Reverse the order of transformations. \n\n Consider: The final string is built from the initial string by applying n transformations. Each transformation is: replace every occurrence of a digit d_i by t_i.\n\n Since the transformations are applied in order, the last transformation is the one that is applied to the entire string. However, the last transformation might depend on digits that were introduced by previous transformations.\n\n But note: each transformation only replaces one specific digit (d_i) by a string (t_i). And the digits in t_i can be from '0' to '9'. \n\n We can precompute the effect of each transformation on the entire process by working backwards. However, we are to compute the final number.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire process is a composition of functions. Each function f_i: string -> string, defined by replacing d_i by t_i.\n\n We want to compute the final number mod 1000000007.\n\n However, the length of the string can be huge (up to 10^5 * (max expansion per query) but the expansion is bounded by the fact that the total length of all t_i is 10^5, but note: we are doing sequential replacements, and the same digit might be expanded multiple times.\n\n But note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the total length of all the replacement strings. However, the intermediate strings can be long because one replacement might produce a string that is then subject to further replacements.\n\n Example: \n   s0 = \"0\"\n   Query1: \"0->12\"\n   Query2: \"1->34\", \"2->56\"\n\n Then s1 = \"12\", then s2 = \"3456\", then s3 = \"3456\" (if no more queries) but then if we do Query3: \"3->7\", \"4->8\", \"5->9\", then we get a very long string.\n\n However, note: the total length of all ti is 10^5, but the intermediate string can be built from many small expansions. But the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti (the replacement strings) is 10^5, but the initial string is 10^5, and the replacements can lead to exponential growth? \n\n Actually, worst-case: if we have a query that replaces a digit by a string containing that same digit, then we can get infinite recursion? But the problem says: the queries are applied in order, and each query replaces one digit. But note: the queries are given in the order, and each query specifies one digit to replace. The replacements are independent and don't specify dependencies.\n\n However, the problem does not say that a query cannot refer to a digit that will be replaced in a later query. And that is exactly what happens in the third sample: first replace '2' by '0', then replace '0' by '7'.\n\n So we must account for the possibility that a replacement in an early query might introduce a digit that is then replaced by a later query.\n\n But note: the queries are applied sequentially. We cannot avoid building the entire string if we try to simulate step by step, because the length might be too large.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Idea: Instead of simulating the entire string, we can process the queries backwards and keep a mapping from each digit to its final transformation. However, the problem is that the transformations are sequential and each transformation is applied to the entire current string.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the concept of \"transformation composition\". But note: the transformation for a digit d_i in the i-th query is to replace d_i by t_i. Then, after the i-th query, the string is transformed. Then the (i+1)-th query will operate on the transformed string.\n\n But note: the queries are independent and each one specifies one digit. However, the same digit might be replaced multiple times. But in the forward direction, we do:\n\n   s0 = initial string\n   s1 = s0 after first query (replace all occurrences of d1 by t1)\n   s2 = s1 after second query (replace all occurrences of d2 by t2)\n\n But the catch: in s1, the digit d2 might appear because t1 contains d2. Similarly, in s2, the digit d3 (from a third query) might appear because t2 contains d3.\n\n However, we are given the queries in order, and we have to do them in order.\n\n But the constraints: the total length of all t_i is 10^5, but the intermediate strings can be very long.\n\n We must use a method that does not explicitly build the string.\n\n Insight: Instead of building the string, we can compute the value of the final number by processing the string and the transformations.\n\n We can consider the following: \n\n   The entire transformation is a function F that maps the initial string to the final string. We wish to compute the number represented by F(s0) mod 1000000007.\n\n How to compute without building the string?\n\n We can use a technique similar to evaluating expressions with variables, but here we have digit replacements.\n\n Let's denote that at the end of all queries, each digit d (from '0' to '9') has been replaced by some string. But note: the queries are in order and the last transformation for a digit d is the one that appears last in the list of queries that targets d. However, there might be multiple queries targeting the same digit d, but they are applied in increasing order of the query index.\n\n Actually, the queries are applied in the given order. So if we have two queries for the same digit, the first one is applied first and then the second one. But note: the second query for the same digit will replace the digit d with t_j (from the second query), but the first query already replaced d with t_i, and then the second query will replace the d's that were introduced by the first query? \n\n However, wait: the second query is defined as \"d->t_j\", and it is applied to the entire string after the first query. The entire string after the first query has the digit d only if the first query did not remove d (or if the first query replaced d by something else, then the string no longer has d). \n\n Actually, let me clarify: the first query replaces all occurrences of d by t_i. Then the second query replaces all occurrences of d by t_j. But note: in the string after the first query, the digit d has been replaced by t_i. Now, the second query will look for the digit d (the same character) and replace it. But the first query removed d from the positions where it occurred, but if t_i contains the digit d, then the second query will replace those d's.\n\n Example: \n   s0 = \"123\"\n   Query1: \"2->2\"   [this is a no-op, but let's say we have two queries for digit '2':]\n   Query2: \"2->3\"\n\n   After Query1: the string is still \"123\".\n   After Query2: we replace every '2' by '3', so we get \"133\".\n\n But note: if the first query replaces a digit d by a string that contains d, then the second query (for the same d) will replace the d's that were inserted by the first query.\n\n Therefore, the order matters.\n\n How to handle without building the string?\n\n We can process the queries from last to first, and for each digit, we can define a transformation that is the composition of all the queries that target that digit, but we have to account for the fact that the later queries (in the original order) are applied first in reverse.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let f_i(d) = \n        if d == d_i: then the replacement string t_i, but then we must apply the transformations from the subsequent queries (i.e., from i+1 to n) to t_i, because the subsequent queries have already been applied to the entire string.\n\n   However, note: the queries are applied in order from first to last. In reverse, we must apply the transformations from last to first, but the transformation for a digit d at step i is defined by the query at step i, and then we have to apply the transformations for all subsequent queries (which are the ones that occur after i) to the result.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each digit the final transformation (after all queries) by processing the queries in reverse order, but updating the transformation for a digit as:\n\n   Let T(d) be the final string that the digit d is replaced by.\n\n   We start with T(d) = d for each digit d.\n\n   Then, we process the queries from last to first. For a query (d_i, t_i) at step i, we want to update the transformation for d_i: because after step i, the digit d_i is replaced by t_i, but then from step i+1 to n, the string t_i is further transformed by the subsequent queries.\n\n   However, the subsequent queries might change the meaning of the digits in t_i. Specifically, in the final transformation, the string t_i is transformed by replacing each digit x in t_i by T(x) (which we have computed for steps i+1 to n).\n\n   Then, we set T(d_i) = the transformation of the string t_i under the subsequent queries.\n\n   But note: the query at step i is applied to the entire string, and then the subsequent queries are applied to the entire string (including the part that was inserted by step i). So the replacement for d_i is effectively: replace d_i by the string obtained by taking t_i and applying the transformations from step i+1 to n.\n\n   However, we are processing backwards, so we know T(x) for all digits x from the subsequent queries (from i+1 to n) already.\n\n   Then, we set T(d_i) = transform(t_i, T)  [where transform(s, T) means: for each char c in s, replace c by T(c)]\n\n   But note: T(c) is a string (which might be long, but the total length of all t_i is bounded by 10^5, and we are storing for each digit d a pointer to a string? Actually, we can store for each digit d the string T(d) (the final transformation for d). However, the length of T(d) might become large? But note: the total length of all the replacement strings in the queries is 10^5, and we are composing the transformations.\n\n   However, the composition might lead to exponential growth in the length of the stored strings. But note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. But the composed strings might be long. However, we are only storing 10 strings (for digits '0' to '9'). But the transformation for a digit d is a string that is built by replacing each character in the original t_i (from the last query that targets d) by the current T(x) for each x.\n\n   But wait: the queries are given, and we are processing from last to first. The initial T(d) for each digit d is the digit itself (a string of length 1). Then, when we process a query (d_i, t_i) (from last to first), we set:\n\n        T(d_i) = transform(t_i, T)   [meaning: for each char c in t_i, we take T(c)]\n\n   However, the transformation of t_i: we break t_i into its characters, and for each character c, we replace it by the current T(c). But note: the current T(c) is the transformation that we have computed for c from the subsequent queries (which are the ones we've already processed). \n\n   But then, the length of T(d_i) could be very large. However, the problem says that the sum of the lengths of the ti (the original replacement strings) is <= 10^5. But note: the composed transformation for a digit d might be built from many replacement strings.\n\n   However, we must remember: the entire transformation is applied to the initial string. The initial string is up to 10^5, but the composed transformations for the digits are built from the queries. The total length of the composed transformation for all digits might be huge, but we don't store the entire composed transformation for each digit if the length is too big? \n\n   But note: the problem constraints on the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is 10^5, but the composed transformation for a digit might be built from multiple queries. However, the composition is defined by the last query that targets that digit and the subsequent ones. \n\n   However, we are storing for each digit d a string (the entire composed transformation). The length of these strings might be large, but note: the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the composition might lead to exponential growth? \n\n   Example: \n        Query n-1: \"2->34\"\n        Query n: \"3->34\", \"4->34\"\n\n        Then for digit '2': \n            First, we process the last query: \n                For '3': T('3') = transform(\"34\", T) = T('3') + T('4') = (transform(\"34\", T)) = ... \n            Actually, we process backwards: \n                Start with T(d)=d for all d.\n\n                Process query n (last): \n                    For '3': T('3') = transform(\"34\", current T) -> but at this point, we haven't processed query n-1, so we don't know T('3') and T('4') from the subsequent queries? \n\n        Actually, we process the queries from the last to the first. So the last query is the last one in the input.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step n (last): \n            For each digit d that appears in the last query, we update T(d) by replacing each digit in t_n by the current T (which is the identity at the beginning, because we haven't processed any subsequent queries? Actually, no: the last query has no subsequent queries, so T(d) for d not in the last query remains the identity, and for d in the last query, we set T(d) = transform(t_n, T_initial) = t_n.\n\n          Then we process the second last query.\n\n        But note: the last query is the last one, so we start with T(d)=d for all d.\n\n        Then we process the last query (query n): \n            For each digit d that is the key of the last query, we set T(d) = the string obtained by replacing each char in t_n by the current T (which is the identity). So T(d) = t_n.\n\n        Then we process the second last query (query n-1): \n            For the key d_{n-1}, we set T(d_{n-1}) = transform(t_{n-1}, T) = for each char c in t_{n-1}: T(c)\n\n        But T(c) is the transformation we have computed for c from the subsequent queries (which includes query n). \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, queries: \n                Query1: \"2->34\"\n                Query2: \"3->56\", \"4->78\"\n\n            Process last query (query2): \n                T('3') = transform(\"56\", T_initial) = \"56\"\n                T('4') = transform(\"78\", T_initial) = \"78\"\n                Other digits remain as themselves.\n\n            Then process query1: \n                T('2') = transform(\"34\", T) = T('3') + T('4') = \"5678\"\n\n            Then the initial string s is transformed by: \n                Replace each digit d by T(d). \n\n            Example: s = \"2\", then result is \"5678\".\n\n        However, let's simulate forward:\n\n            Start: \"2\"\n            Query1: replace '2' by \"34\" -> \"34\"\n            Query2: replace '3' by \"56\", replace '4' by \"78\": \n                \"34\" becomes \"5678\"\n\n            So it matches.\n\n        But now consider: \n            Query1: \"2->34\"\n            Query2: \"3->2\"\n\n            Then, processing backwards:\n\n                Query2 (last): \n                    T('3') = transform(\"2\", T_initial) = \"2\"\n                Query1:\n                    T('2') = transform(\"34\", T) = T('3') + T('4') = \"2\" + \"4\" = \"24\"\n\n            Then the initial string \"2\" becomes \"24\".\n\n            Forward simulation:\n                Start: \"2\"\n                Query1: \"2\" -> \"34\"\n                Query2: replace '3' by \"2\", so \"34\" becomes \"24\"\n\n            So it works.\n\n        However, the problem: the length of T(d) might become very large. The total length of the composed transformations for all digits might be huge. But note: the problem constraints say that the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) is 10^5. However, the composed transformation for a digit d is built by recursively replacing each digit in the replacement string by its own transformation. \n\n        The total length of T(d) might be exponential in the number of queries that target the digits. But note: the depth is at most 10 (digits 0-9) and the number of queries is 10^5, but we are storing the transformation for each digit independently.\n\n        However, the total length of the composed transformation for a digit d is the product of the expansions? \n\n        Example: \n            Query1: \"2->22\"\n            Query2: \"2->22\"\n\n            Then, processing backwards:\n\n                Query2: T('2') = transform(\"22\", T_initial) = \"22\"\n                Query1: T('2') = transform(\"22\", T_after_query2) = \"22\" (from query2) + \"22\" = \"2222\"\n\n            Then the initial string \"2\" becomes \"2222\", and if we do two queries, we get \"22222222\", etc.\n\n        But the problem: the length can be exponential. The total length of the composed transformation for a digit might be very large (exceeding the limits of storage and computation).\n\n        However, note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti (the original replacement strings) is <= 10^5. But the composed transformation for a digit is built by expanding each character in the replacement string by the current transformation. The expansion factor for a character c is the length of T(c). \n\n        The length of T(d) for a digit d is:\n\n            L(d) = (if d is the key of a query) then the expansion of the replacement string t_i (from the last query that targets d) by the current transformations.\n\n        But the current transformations for the characters in t_i are the ones we have computed from subsequent queries.\n\n        The total length of the composed transformation for a digit d might be huge. However, we are not storing the entire string if the length is too big. We must find a way to compute the value without building the entire string.\n\n        We are only interested in the numeric value mod 1000000007.\n\n        We can store for each digit d two things:\n\n            val(d): the numeric value of the string T(d) mod 1000000007.\n            len(d): the length of the string T(d) (so that we know the power of 10 to use when appending)\n\n        Then, when we compose two transformations, we can compute:\n\n            For a transformation for a digit d: \n                T(d) = s (a string)\n\n            Then, the value of T(d) is the number represented by s mod 1000000007.\n\n            But note: the entire transformation is applied to the initial string. The initial string is transformed by replacing each digit by T(d). Then the entire number is the concatenation of the transformations for each digit in the initial string.\n\n        However, the initial string is transformed by replacing each digit by the entire string T(d). Then the final number is the concatenation of T(d) for each digit d in the initial string.\n\n        But wait: the initial string is a string of digits. Then we replace each digit d by the string T(d). Then the entire string is the concatenation of T(d_i) for each digit d_i in the initial string.\n\n        Then, the value of the final number is:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each digit d in the initial string:\n                value = (value * (10^(len(T(d)))) + val(T(d))) % mod\n\n        However, we must account for the fact that the transformation T(d) is the entire composed transformation for d.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n                val[d] = 0   # the numeric value mod 1000000007 of the final transformation for d\n                len[d] = 0   # the length (number of digits) of the final transformation for d\n\n            Initially, for each digit d (as a character from '0' to '9'):\n                val[d] = d   (converted to int) % mod, but note: if the string is \"0\", then the value is 0, but if the string is \"00\", then the value is 0, but note: the entire transformation for a digit might be the empty string.\n\n            However, we must account for the empty string: \n                If T(d) is the empty string, then the length is 0 and the value is 0.\n\n            Then, we process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For a query (d_i, t_i):\n\n                We need to update the transformation for d_i.\n\n                The new transformation for d_i is the string obtained by replacing each character c in t_i by T(c) (the current transformation for c).\n\n                Then, we can compute the value and length for d_i's transformation from the parts.\n\n                But note: the transformation for d_i is the concatenation of the transformations for each character in t_i.\n\n                How to compute the value and length for the new transformation?\n\n                Let the current transformation for d_i be represented by (val_i, len_i). We don't store the entire string.\n\n                We know for each character c in t_i: \n                    Let (v_c, l_c) = (val[c], len[c])\n\n                Then, the transformation for t_i is:\n\n                    value = 0\n                    for each char c in t_i:\n                        value = (value * (10^(l_c)) + v_c) % mod\n\n                And the total length is the sum of the lengths: L = sum_{c in t_i} l_c\n\n                Then, we set:\n                    val[d_i] = value\n                    len[d_i] = L\n\n            Then, after processing all queries, we transform the initial string s0:\n\n                result = 0\n                for each char c in s0:\n                    v = val[c]\n                    l = len[c]\n                    result = (result * pow(10, l, mod) + v) % mod\n\n            But wait: the initial string s0 is transformed by replacing each digit c by T(c). So the entire string is the concatenation of T(c) for each c.\n\n            However, we must consider: the transformation for a digit c is stored as (val[c], len[c]), so the entire string is built by concatenating these.\n\n            Example: \n                s0 = \"12\"\n                Query1: \"1->3\", \"2->4\"\n\n                Then, we process queries in reverse order (only one query, so we process \"1->3\" and \"2->4\" in reverse? Actually, we have two queries? No, the example has two queries: one for '1' and one for '2'. \n\n                But wait, the input format: the next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\". There can be multiple queries for the same digit? \n\n                However, the problem says: the queries are given in the order. \n\n                In our reverse processing, we must consider: the last query is the one that is applied last. So if we have two queries, we process the last one first.\n\n            Steps for two queries (example with two queries):\n\n                Input: \n                    s0 = \"12\"\n                    n = 2\n                    Query1: \"1->34\"\n                    Query2: \"3->56\", \"4->78\"\n\n                Actually, wait: the queries are given as separate lines. The example input format: \n                    The second line is the integer n, then n lines, each is \"di->ti\"\n\n                But note: each query is specified by one line. So we have two queries, and the first query is \"1->34\", the second query is \"3->56\" and \"4->78\"? No, wait: the example input format is:\n\n                    \"di->ti\" for one query per line.\n\n                But the example: \n                    Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n\n                So the two queries are:\n                    Query1: \"2->0\"\n                    Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n                Then, we process the last query (query2) first:\n\n                    Query2: \"0->7\", so t_i = \"7\"\n                    Then, for digit '0': \n                        We look at the current transformations for each char in \"7\": \n                            Only char '7' -> initially, for '7': \n                                val['7'] = 7, len['7'] = 1.\n\n                    So the transformation for '0' becomes:\n                        value = 7, length = 1.\n\n                    Then, process the first query (query1): \"2->0\"\n                    Now, for digit '2', we replace by \"0\", so we use the current transformation for '0' (which we just updated) to expand \"0\":\n                        value = val['0'] = 7, length = 1.\n\n                    Then, the initial string \"222\" becomes three times the transformation for '2', which is 7, so the entire string is \"777\", and the value is 777.\n\n                How to compute the value for the entire string?\n\n                    We have the initial string \"222\", and we replace each '2' by \"7\", so we get \"777\".\n\n                    Then, we compute the number: 777.\n\n                But note: the transformation for '2' is \"7\", so the length for '2' is 1, and the value for '2' is 7.\n\n                Then, the entire number is computed by:\n\n                    result = 0\n                    for c in \"222\":\n                        result = (result * (10^(len[c])) + val[c]) % mod\n\n                    = (0 * 10^1 + 7) = 7\n                    Then (7 * 10^1 + 7) = 77\n                    Then (77 * 10^1 + 7) = 777.\n\n                That matches.\n\n            But note: what if the replacement string is empty?\n\n                Example: Query: \"3->\" (empty string)\n                Then, for digit '3', the replacement string is \"\".\n\n                Then, the transformation for '3' is the empty string: \n                    value = 0, length = 0.\n\n                Then, when we process the initial string that contains a '3', we replace it by nothing.\n\n            However, the problem: the entire string is built by concatenation. The empty string has value 0 and length 0.\n\n            But note: if we have a digit d that is replaced by an empty string, then in the transformation of the initial string, that digit is omitted.\n\n            Example: \n                s0 = \"123\"\n                Query: \"3->\"\n\n                Then, the transformation for '3' is (0,0).\n\n                Then, the entire string is the transformation for '1' concatenated with the transformation for '2' (and the transformation for '3' is omitted).\n\n                But wait: the transformation for '1' and '2' are their own digits? \n\n                We have to initialize the transformations for digits that are not queried. \n\n                Initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'), we set:\n\n                    val[d] = d (converted to integer) % mod\n                    len[d] = 1\n\n                Then, when processing a query, we update the digit that is the key.\n\n                But then, after processing the query \"3->\", the transformation for '3' becomes (0,0). \n\n                Then, the initial string \"123\" is transformed by:\n\n                    '1' -> (val['1']=1, len['1']=1)\n                    '2' -> (val['2']=2, len['2']=1)\n                    '3' -> (0,0)\n\n                Then, the entire number is computed as:\n\n                    result = 0\n                    for c in \"123\":\n                        result = (result * (10^(len[c])) + val[c]) % mod\n\n                    Step1: c='1': result = (0 * 10^1 + 1) % mod = 1\n                    Step2: c='2': result = (1 * 10^1 + 2) % mod = 12\n                    Step3: c='3': result = (12 * 10^0 + 0) % mod = 12 * 1 + 0 = 12\n\n                The example input: \n                    \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n                Expected output: \"1212\"\n\n                But wait, the example input is:\n\n                    Input: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n                So the initial string is \"123123\", and the query is \"3->\", so we remove all '3's.\n\n                Then the string becomes \"1212\".\n\n                Then the number is 1212.\n\n                With our method:\n\n                    We update the transformation for '3' to (0,0).\n\n                    Then, we transform the initial string \"123123\":\n\n                        '1': (1,1)\n                        '2': (2,1)\n                        '3': (0,0)\n                        '1': (1,1)\n                        '2': (2,1)\n                        '3': (0,0)\n\n                    Then the entire string is: \n                        Start with 0.\n                        0 * 10^1 + 1 -> 1\n                        1 * 10^1 + 2 -> 12\n                        12 * 10^0 + 0 -> 12\n                        12 * 10^1 + 1 -> 121\n                        121 * 10^1 + 2 -> 1212\n                        1212 * 10^0 + 0 -> 1212\n\n                So the result is 1212.\n\n            However, note: the example input \"123123\" with query \"3->\" gives \"1212\", which is the expected output.\n\n            But wait: the example input says:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n                Output: \n                    ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n            Our method for the first example:\n\n                s0 = \"123123\"\n                n = 1\n                Query: \"2->00\"\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of digit replacement queries on an initial string and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves transforming an initial string by sequentially replacing each occurrence of specified digits with given strings. The final string, after all transformations, represents a number that we need to compute modulo 1000000007. Directly processing each query by modifying the string is impractical due to potential exponential growth in string length.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each query forward, we reverse the order of transformations. For each digit, we determine its final transformation (a string) by considering all subsequent queries. This allows us to compute the value and length of the transformed digit without handling large intermediate strings.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to store two pieces of information for each digit:\n   - **Value (val)**: The numeric value of the transformed digit's string modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length (len)**: The number of digits in the transformed string.\n   \n   Processing queries in reverse order, for each query (digit → string), we update the digit's transformation by replacing each character in the replacement string with its current transformation (computed from subsequent queries).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order. For each query, it processes each character in the replacement string, updating the digit's transformation. The total operations are linear with respect to the sum of the lengths of all replacement strings, which is bounded by 10^5 according to the problem constraints. Thus, the solution efficiently handles the input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s0 = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        if \"->\" in line:\n            parts = line.split('->')\n            digit = parts[0].strip()\n            replacement = parts[1].strip()\n            queries.append((digit, replacement))\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    length_arr = [0] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        val[i] = i % MOD\n        length_arr[i] = 1\n        \n    for i in range(9, -1, -1):\n        val[i] = i\n        length_arr[i] = 1\n        \n    for d_str, t_str in reversed(queries):\n        d = int(d_str)\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        power = 1\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            digit_char = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            exp = length_arr[digit_char]\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, exp, MOD) + val[digit_char]) % MOD\n            new_len += length_arr[digit_char]\n        \n        val[d] = new_val\n        length_arr[d] = new_len\n        \n    result = 0\n    mod = MOD\n    for char in s0:\n        d = int(char)\n        l = length_arr[d]\n        v = val[d]\n        result = (result * pow(10, l, mod) + v) % mod\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string and number of queries are read. Each query specifies a digit and its replacement string.\n2. **Digit Transformations**: For each digit (0-9), initialize its value as the digit itself and length as 1.\n3. **Reverse Processing**: Process each query in reverse order. For each query, compute the new value and length of the digit by expanding its replacement string using current transformations of its characters.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, transform the initial string by replacing each digit with its final transformation. Compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007 by iteratively combining the values and lengths of these transformations.\n5. **Output**: Print the computed result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations by leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, avoiding the pitfalls of direct string manipulation with potentially huge intermediate strings.",
