    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The subsegment must be strictly increasing after the change (if any).\n\n Approach:\n We can consider three cases for a subsegment that might be fixed by changing one element:\n\n 1. The entire segment is strictly increasing. Then we don't need to change anything, and we can take the whole segment.\n\n 2. There is exactly one drop (or one violation) and we can fix it by changing one element. However, note that sometimes fixing one element might not be straightforward.\n\n Actually, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n Let's precompute two arrays:\n   left[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change).\n   right[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting exactly at i.\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one number arbitrarily. So we can consider:\n\n Case 1: Entire segment is already strictly increasing -> then answer = n.\n\n Case 2: We are allowed to change one number. Then we can have a candidate segment that might have one violation.\n\n How to handle violations?\n We can think of the following:\n\n We traverse the array and try to find the longest contiguous segment that has at most one violation (which we can fix by changing one element). However, note that the violation might be fixed by changing one element, but the fixed element must be such that the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute two arrays:\n    left[i] = length of increasing segment ending at i (without changes)\n        if i==0: 1\n        else: \n            if a[i] > a[i-1]: left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            else: left[i] = 1\n\n    right[i] = length of increasing segment starting at i (without changes)\n        if i==n-1: 1\n        else:\n            if a[i] < a[i+1]: right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            else: right[i] = 1\n\n 2. Now, consider the possibility of having a segment that has exactly one violation (and we change one element). We can consider:\n\n    Candidate 1: Entire segment (if already strictly increasing)\n\n    Candidate 2: Segments that are almost increasing with one change.\n\n    We can also consider segments that are missing one element in the middle.\n\n    We can iterate through the array and look for positions where the condition breaks.\n\n    For each index i (from 1 to n-2), if there is a violation at i (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]), then we can check:\n\n        - If we can fix the violation at i or at i+1? Actually, we are allowed to change one number arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the violation is between i and i+1. We can fix the segment by changing either a[i] or a[i+1]?\n\n        However, we might have multiple consecutive violations? Actually, note: we are allowed only one change. So we can only fix one violation.\n\n        But what if the violation is not isolated? Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n            - The violation is at index 1 (between 3 and 2). We can fix by changing 3 to something less than 2 (but then the previous part breaks) or changing 2 to something greater than 3. \n\n        Actually, let's define the candidate segment that includes the violation and the surrounding increasing parts.\n\n        We can consider:\n\n        Option A: Change the element at position i (the first element of the violation) to be less than a[i-1] and greater than a[i-1]? Actually, we want to make the entire segment strictly increasing.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the segment from (start of an increasing segment that ends at i-1) to (end of an increasing segment that starts at i+1). Then the total length would be left[i-1] + right[i+1] (if we change a[i]) but wait: the segment must include a[i] and a[i+1]?\n\n        Actually, we have two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: Fix the drop by changing a[i] (so that a[i] becomes something between a[i-1] and a[i+1] if a[i+1] > a[i-1]). But note: we can set a[i] to any integer. So we can set a[i] to be just below a[i+1] (if we are concerned about the next part) or just above a[i-1]. However, we must ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the rest of the array to remain unchanged. Only the chosen subsegment is considered, and we are allowed to set one number arbitrarily.\n\n        So, the candidate segment when considering the drop at i (between i-1 and i) is not necessarily the same as the drop at i (between i and i+1). Let me clarify:\n\n        We are going to consider every adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is not increasing. Then, we can form a candidate segment that covers from the start of the left increasing run (that ends at i-1) to the end of the right increasing run (that starts at i+1) and then remove the element that caused the problem? Actually, we can cover:\n\n        Candidate from (left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1) ? Because we are including the element at i? But wait, we are allowed to change one element, so we can keep the element at i. However, the violation is at i (a[i] >= a[i+1]) OR at i-1 (a[i-1] >= a[i])? Actually, the violation we are considering is at i (meaning a[i] >= a[i+1])? Or we should consider the drop between i-1 and i?\n\n        Let me restructure: Instead, we can consider two types of violations:\n\n        Type 1: The current element is too high (at index i) so that a[i] >= a[i+1]. Then we can change a[i] to something less than a[i+1] (but then we must also check that this change doesn't break the increasing order with the previous element, i.e., a[i-1] < a[i] (the new value)). But we are free to choose any integer, so we can set a[i] to be max(a[i-1]+1, ...) but we don't know the exact value. However, we don't need to know the exact value to compute the length.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n        When we see a[i] >= a[i+1], then we can form a candidate segment from:\n\n          Option 1: Remove the element at i (then the segment becomes [ ... , a[i-1]] and [a[i+1], ... ] and we can merge them if a[i-1] < a[i+1]). Then the candidate length would be left[i-1] + right[i+1] (if we remove the element at i) but note: we are allowed to change one element, so we can keep the element at i. However, if we keep the element at i, we must set it to a value that fits between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if a[i-1] < a[i+1]). Then the segment from (i-left[i-1]+1) to (i+right[i+1]-1) would have length = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1] (because we keep a[i]) and the condition is that a[i-1] < a[i] (new value) and a[i] (new value) < a[i+1]. Since we can set a[i] to anything, we can set it to any value between a[i-1]+1 and a[i+1]-1 (if they exist). So the condition is that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then we can have a segment of length left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n        But note: we can also fix by changing a[i+1] (the next one) to be greater than a[i]. Then the segment would be from the beginning of the left part (ending at i) and the right part (starting at i+1) without including the fixed element? Actually, if we change a[i+1], then we can set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i]. Then the segment would be from the start of the left part (ending at i) and extend the right part? But the left part at i is already broken because the violation is between i and i+1. However, if we fix a[i+1], then the condition between i and i+1 is satisfied (a[i] < a[i+1]) but the segment must be strictly increasing. Then the entire segment from (i - left[i] + 1) to (i+1 + right[i+1] - 1) would be valid? Actually, the left part ending at i is of length left[i] (so from i-left[i]+1 to i). Then we fix a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and then the next part (from i+1 to the end of the right[i+1]) is increasing. So the total length is left[i] + right[i+1] (because we are including both sides). But note: the element at i is included, and the element at i+1 is included (we changed it). However, we are allowed only one change, so we are using that change here.\n\n        Therefore, for a violation at i (a[i] >= a[i+1]), we can do:\n\n          Candidate1 (fixing a[i]): if i-1 < 0, then we can only fix by making sure the next part is increasing? Actually, we need to check boundaries.\n\n        We must consider the boundaries:\n\n        Let L = left[i-1] if we fix at i, then the left part goes back to i - left[i-1] (so the segment from i-left[i-1]+1 to i) and then we fix a[i] to be less than a[i+1] (so we can merge with the right part). The condition for merging is that the last element of the left part (which is a[i-1]) must be less than the fixed a[i] (which we can set arbitrarily) and then the fixed a[i] must be less than a[i+1]. Since we can set arbitrarily, the condition is that a[i-1] < a[i+1] (because we can set a[i] to any value between a[i-1]+1 and a[i+1]-1). Then the total length is left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n        Similarly, if we fix at i+1: then we require that a[i] < a[i+1] (after change). We can set a[i+1] to any value greater than a[i]. Then the segment from i - left[i] + 1 (the entire increasing segment ending at i) and then the entire increasing segment starting at i+1 (with the fixed value) is valid. The condition is automatically satisfied for the left side (since the segment ending at i is increasing) and the fixed a[i+1] is greater than a[i]. Then the total length is left[i] + right[i+1] (because the segment from i-left[i]+1 to i is left[i] elements, and then the right part starting at i+1 is right[i+1] (including i+1)).\n\n        However, note: the left[i] is defined as the increasing segment ending at i, so the segment from i-left[i]+1 to i is increasing. Then we change a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and the next part (if any) is increasing. But wait, what if the violation is actually at the boundary? For example, if the segment ending at i is increasing, then the segment starting at i+1 is increasing, and we fix a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] (which is the last element of the left part). Then the entire merged segment (from i-left[i]+1 to i+right[i+1]) is increasing.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change at most one number. So we can use only one change. Then we can choose which one to fix.\n\n        Therefore, for each violation (each i from 0 to n-2 where a[i] >= a[i+1]), we can consider:\n\n          candidate1 = (if i == 0) then we cannot use left[i-1] so we must fix by setting a[i] to be less than a[i+1]. Then the segment from 0 to i+right[i+1] (but wait, the left part for i is 1, but we are removing the left part? Actually, no: we are keeping the element at i (so we use the entire left part ending at i) but wait: our left[i] is computed from the original array. \n\n        Actually, we should not use the original left[i] for the fixed part. We are going to simulate the change.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n        For each i (from 0 to n-2) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n\n          Option 1: Fix a[i] (if i>0, then we require that the left part (ending at i-1) is increasing and then we set a[i] to something between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if a[i-1] < a[i+1])). Then the segment from (i - left[i-1] + 1) to (i+right[i+1]) has length = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1] (if i>=1). If i==0, then we cannot use left[i-1] (because there is no i-1). Then we can set a[0] to any value less than a[1] (so the segment from 0 to right[1] has length 1 + right[1] (because the left part of a[0] is just [a0] and we fix a0, then the next part is the increasing segment starting at 1, so we can merge the entire increasing part from 0 to the end of the increasing run starting at 1). But wait, if we fix a0, then the segment from 0 to the entire increasing run starting at 1 (which is from 0 to 0+right[1]-1) but note: we are allowed to set a0 arbitrarily, so we set a0 < a[1]. Then the entire increasing run from 0 to (right[1]-1) is of length 1 + right[1] (since we have a0, then a1, a2, ... until the increasing breaks). But wait, the increasing run starting at 1 is right[1] (which includes a1 to a1+right[1]-1). So the segment from 0 to 1+right[1]-1 is of length 1 + right[1] (because we have index0, then indices 1 to 1+right[1]-1).\n\n          Option 2: Fix a[i+1] (then we require that the left part ending at i is increasing (so we can use left[i]) and then we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i]. Then the segment from i - left[i] + 1 to i+1 + right[i+2] - 1 (if i+2 exists) but wait, we are only allowed to change one element, so we can extend the right part? Actually, the increasing segment starting at i+1 (after fixing) will be the original right[i+1] (which is the increasing run starting at i+1) but note: we are changing a[i+1] so the increasing run starting at i+1 becomes the entire run from i+1 to the end of the original increasing run (because we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and the rest remains). However, the increasing run starting at i+1 originally is right[i+1] (so from i+1 to i+right[i+1]). But note: we are allowed to change a[i+1] arbitrarily, so the condition for the next element (if any) is that the new a[i+1] must be less than a[i+2] (if exists). But wait, the original a[i+1] might be the last element, then we don't care. However, the increasing run starting at i+1 (after change) is determined by the original increasing run that starts at i+1, but we are allowed to change a[i+1] so we can set it to be less than a[i+2] (if exists) or if it doesn't exist then we don't need to worry. Actually, the increasing run starting at i+1 after change is the entire original increasing run that started at i+1 (because we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and the rest of the increasing run is still there). But wait, if the original increasing run starting at i+1 was broken because we changed a[i+1] arbitrarily, we can set it to be the correct value to continue the increasing run? Actually, no: the rest of the increasing run (from i+2 onward) is fixed. We must set a[i+1] to be less than a[i+2] (if we want to use the next part). But note: the problem says we can change one number arbitrarily, so we can set a[i+1] to any integer. Therefore, we can set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if exists) to preserve the increasing condition for the next part. However, we are allowed to change only one number, so we cannot fix two problems. But note: the increasing run starting at i+1 (in the original array) is computed without considering the change. After the change, we can set a[i+1] to be the minimum value that is greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if we wish to merge the next part). However, if we are only concerned with the length, we don't need to know the exact value. The entire increasing run starting at i+1 (in the original array) is available, because we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and then the rest of the increasing run (if any) is still increasing. Therefore, the length of the segment from i-left[i]+1 to i+right[i+1] (because the right part after i+1 is the entire original increasing run from i+1, which is right[i+1] long) is left[i] + right[i+1] (note: the segment from i-left[i]+1 to i is of length left[i] and from i+1 to i+right[i+1] is of length right[i+1]; so together they form a segment of length left[i] + right[i+1] (because we are including both the left part and the right part, and the fixed element at i+1 is included in the right part)).\n\n        However, wait: the original increasing run starting at i+1 is right[i+1] (so from i+1 to i+right[i+1]). But we are including the fixed element at i+1, so the entire segment from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) has length = left[i] + right[i+1] (because we are skipping the element at i? Actually, no: the left part ends at i, and the right part starts at i+1, so we are connecting i and i+1 by the fixed element. The entire segment from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) is from index (i-left[i]+1) to index (i+right[i+1]) which is (i+right[i+1] - (i-left[i]+1) + 1) = left[i] + right[i+1] + 1? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        The left part: from (i-left[i]+1) to i -> length = left[i]\n        The right part: from i+1 to i+right[i+1] -> length = right[i+1]\n\n        Then the entire segment from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) has length = (i+right[i+1] - (i-left[i]+1) + 1) = left[i] + right[i+1] (because (i+right[i+1]) - (i-left[i]+1) + 1 = left[i] + right[i+1])\n\n        Example: \n          left[i] = 3 -> indices: [i-2, i-1, i] (so 3 elements)\n          right[i+1] = 2 -> indices: [i+1, i+2] (so 2 elements)\n          Total indices: [i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2] -> 5 elements, which is 3+2.\n\n        Therefore, the candidate for fixing at i+1 is left[i] + right[i+1].\n\n        Similarly, for fixing at i (if i>=1): \n          The left part ending at i-1 is of length left[i-1] (indices: [i-left[i-1], ..., i-1])\n          Then we fix a[i] (so we keep the element at i) and then the right part starting at i+1 is of length right[i+1] (indices: [i+1, ..., i+right[i+1]])\n          The entire segment from (i-left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]) is of length: (i+right[i+1] - (i-left[i-1]) + 1) = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]\n\n        But wait, the segment from (i-left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]) is:\n\n          Start: i-left[i-1] to i (from the left part) and then i+right[i+1] (the end of the right part). However, note we are including the fixed element at i (so we have the element at i). The left part goes from i-left[i-1] to i-1 (length left[i-1]) and then we add the element at i (so +1) and then the right part from i+1 to i+right[i+1] (so +right[i+1]). Then the total length is left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n        However, we must check that we can fix the element at i: we require that the left part (ending at i-1) is increasing and the right part (starting at i+1) is increasing, and that the last element of the left part (a[i-1]) is less than the next element (the fixed a[i]) and the fixed a[i] is less than a[i+1]. Since we can choose arbitrarily, the condition is that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then the candidate is valid.\n\n        What if i==0? Then we cannot use the left part (left[-1] doesn't exist). Then we fix a[0] and the segment is from 0 to right[1]-1 (if we consider the entire increasing run starting at 1). Then the length is 1 (for the fixed a[0]) + right[1] (the increasing run from 1). But wait, we are allowed to set a[0] arbitrarily, so we set it to a value less than a[1]. Then the entire increasing run from 0 to the end of the increasing run starting at 1 (which is 1+right[1]-1) is of length 1 + right[1]. \n\n        Similarly, what if i = n-2? Then we cannot use the right part (because i+1 = n-1, so right[i+1] = 1). Then for fixing at i: we require a[i-1] < a[n-1] (so we can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[n-1]). Then the candidate is left[i-1] + 1 + 1.\n\n        Also, for fixing at i+1 (when i = n-2): we require the left part at i (which is the increasing run ending at i) and then we set a[i+1] to a value greater than a[i]. Then the candidate is left[i] + 1 (because right[i+1] is 1).\n\n        But note: we can also consider segments that are at the boundaries (like the entire array) and segments that are not necessarily having a violation in the middle. Also, we can have segments that don't contain any violation (then we don't need to fix) and we can take the entire increasing segment.\n\n        However, we are asked for the longest subsegment that is strictly increasing after at most one change.\n\n        We must consider:\n\n        Candidate 0: Entire array is already strictly increasing -> then answer = n.\n\n        But note: we might have a longer segment by including more than one violation? Actually, no: because we are allowed only one change.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute left and right arrays.\n\n        Step 2: The maximum candidate without any change is the maximum value of the increasing runs (the entire array, or the longest increasing run). But note: we are allowed to change one number arbitrarily, so we might get a longer run by combining two increasing runs with a fix in the middle.\n\n        Step 3: Consider:\n\n          candidate_ans = max(n, ...)   # but wait: if the entire array is increasing, then n is a candidate.\n\n          However, we might have a candidate that is longer than n? No, because n is the entire array.\n\n        Actually, the entire array is of length n. So the maximum possible is n.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a segment that is longer than the entire array? No.\n\n        Step 4: We consider:\n\n          candidate_ans = max(candidate_ans, left[i] + right[i]) for all i (this is the standard longest increasing subsegment without change, but note: we are allowed to change one element, but we don't need to change if the entire segment is increasing. However, we are looking for the longest segment that can be made strictly increasing by at most one change.\n\n        Actually, the standard longest increasing subsegment (without change) is computed by the left and right arrays: the longest increasing subsegment is the maximum over (left[i] + right[i] - 1) for i from 0 to n-1? Not exactly: the left[i] is the increasing run ending at i, and right[i] is the increasing run starting at i. The entire increasing run containing i is left[i] + right[i] - 1.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change one element. So we might get a longer segment by combining two increasing runs with one fixed element in the middle.\n\n        However, we must not forget that we can also have segments that are already increasing (so we don't need to change) and we can also have segments that are fixed by one change.\n\n        Step 5: Algorithm:\n\n        ans = 1   (minimum segment length is 1)\n\n        # Case 1: Entire array is increasing? Then candidate is n.\n        # But note: we can also have a candidate that is longer than the entire array? No.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # Case 0: Without change, the longest increasing subsegment (which is the maximum value of (left[i] + right[i] - 1) for i in range(n))\n        # But wait: we are allowed to change one element, so maybe we can get a longer segment by combining two increasing runs (with one fixed element) and that combined segment might be longer than the longest increasing subsegment without change.\n\n        So we need to consider:\n\n          candidate1 = n   (if the entire array is increasing, then we don't need to change, so we can use the entire array)\n\n          candidate2 = for each i (from 0 to n-2) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n                candidate = max( left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1] if i>=1 and (a[i-1] < a[i+1]) else 0, \n                                 left[i] + right[i+1] if (i < n-1) else 0 )\n\n          But wait, we must consider both options for each violation.\n\n        Actually, we can combine:\n\n          For each i from 0 to n-2:\n\n            if a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n                # Check candidate by fixing a[i] (if i>=1) and if condition holds (a[i-1] < a[i+1])\n                cand1 = 0\n                cand2 = 0\n\n                if i == 0:\n                    # Fixing a0: we require nothing from the left, so the segment from 0 to i+right[i+1] (length = 1 + right[i+1])\n                    cand1 = 1 + right[i+1]   # because we fix a0 and then the entire right part is used (from 1 to the end of the increasing run starting at 1)\n                    # But note: the entire segment from 0 to (i+right[i+1]) has length 1 + right[i+1] (because the right part starting at 1 is right[i+1] long, and we are including index0 and then the next right[i+1] elements).\n                else:\n                    # Fixing a[i]: we require that the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1) can be merged (a[i-1] < a[i+1])\n                    if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                        cand1 = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]\n\n                # Fixing a[i+1]: we require that the left part ending at i is increasing (so we can use the entire increasing run ending at i) and we fix a[i+1] to be greater than a[i]. Then the segment is from i-left[i]+1 to i+right[i+1] (length = left[i] + right[i+1])\n                if i < n-1:\n                    cand2 = left[i] + right[i+1]   # because the left part ending at i is of length left[i] and the right part starting at i+1 (after fix) is of length right[i+1] (and note: the entire increasing run starting at i+1 is preserved because we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and the rest remains increasing, so we can use the entire right[i+1] as given)\n\n                # Also, we can fix at i+1 even if i==n-1? Actually, i goes from 0 to n-2, so i<n-1 is always true for i in [0, n-3]. For i=n-2, we still do the second part.\n\n                # Then update ans = max(ans, cand1, cand2)\n\n          Additionally, we must consider the possibility that the entire array is increasing (then we don't have any violation) and then the answer is n.\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to change one element even if the entire array is increasing? Then we can change one element arbitrarily, but the entire array is already strictly increasing, so we don't need to change. However, we can still use the entire array. But note: the problem says \"at most one\", so we can change zero or one.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider:\n\n          candidate_ans = max(n, ... )   # if the entire array is increasing, then n is the candidate.\n\n        However, we might have a candidate that is larger than n? No, because the array has n elements.\n\n        But wait: what if we consider a subsegment that is the entire array? Then we can change one element arbitrarily. But if the entire array is increasing, we don't need to change, so we can take the entire array. However, we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily, so we could even extend the array? No, the subsegment must be contiguous and within the array.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to consider extending beyond the array.\n\n        However, note: we might have a candidate that is the entire array (n) and that is already increasing, so we don't need to change. But if the entire array is not increasing, then we cannot use the entire array without a change, but we can use a part of the array (with one change) that is longer than the entire array? No, the entire array is the longest contiguous segment.\n\n        Actually, we are considering contiguous subsegments. The entire array is contiguous.\n\n        But wait: what if we have an array that is not entirely increasing, but by changing one element we can make a subsegment of length n? Then we would output n.\n\n        Therefore, we must check for each i (from 0 to n-2) and also consider the entire array.\n\n        However, note: the entire array is of length n. We can change one element arbitrarily, so if we can fix one drop in the entire array, then the entire array becomes increasing. But note: we are only allowed to change one element. If there are more than one drop, then we cannot fix the entire array by changing one element.\n\n        Therefore, we must check: the entire array is increasing? Then we can use the entire array.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the entire array as a candidate if the number of drops (non-increasing adjacent pairs) is at most one and if the condition for merging holds.\n\n        But wait: the entire array is one candidate. How do we check for the entire array?\n\n        We can check: if the entire array is increasing, then candidate = n.\n\n        But if the entire array is not increasing, then we can consider the entire array only if we can fix one drop. However, the entire array might have more than one drop, so we cannot fix it with one change.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the entire array to be the subsegment. We can choose any contiguous subsegment.\n\n        Therefore, we are not forced to use the entire array.\n\n        However, the above method for each violation considers contiguous subsegments that are built from two increasing runs and one fixed element.\n\n        But what about a subsegment that is entirely contained in one increasing run? Then we don't need to fix, and the length is the entire run (which we already consider in the standard longest increasing subsegment without change). However, we are allowed to change one element, but we don't have to. So we can take the entire increasing run without change.\n\n        And also, we can have a subsegment that is a single element (always strictly increasing).\n\n        So we need to consider:\n\n          candidate_ans = max(candidate_ans, \n                             n,   # if the entire array is increasing, then we can take the entire array without change (so we don't need to fix, but we are allowed to change one element if needed, but we don't need to)\n                             and all the candidates from fixing one element in the middle.\n\n        But wait: if the entire array is increasing, then we don't need to change, so we can take the entire array. But if we have a candidate from fixing one element that is the entire array, then we don't need to change. However, the entire array might have multiple violations, then we cannot fix the entire array with one change.\n\n        Actually, we can only fix one violation. So the entire array is increasing if and only if there is no violation (a[i] >= a[i+1] for all i) is false. Actually, no: strictly increasing means a[i] < a[i+1] for all i. So if we have one violation, we can fix it (by changing one element) and then the entire array might become increasing. But wait, the entire array is of length n, and we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. However, if there are multiple violations, we cannot fix the entire array by changing one element (because each violation requires a fix, and we can only fix one).\n\n        Therefore, we cannot consider the entire array as a candidate if there is more than one violation.\n\n        However, we are not forced to use the entire array. We can use a part of the array.\n\n        So the entire array is a candidate only if we can fix one violation (and the entire array is the segment we are considering). But note: the entire array might have two violations. Then we cannot fix the entire array by changing one element.\n\n        Therefore, we must not assume the entire array is a candidate. Instead, we can consider:\n\n          candidate_ans = 1\n\n          # Without change: the longest increasing contiguous segment is the maximum value of (left[i] + right[i] - 1) for i in range(n) [but note: the increasing contiguous segment without change is the maximum value of (left[i] + right[i] - 1) is the length of the increasing segment containing i, but we are allowed to change one element, so we might get a longer segment by combining two segments with one change.\n\n          Actually, we are going to consider:\n\n            candidate_ans = max(candidate_ans, max(left[i] for i in range(n)))   # the longest increasing contiguous segment without change.\n\n          Then, we consider the cases with one change (the two options for each violation).\n\n        But note: the entire array might be increasing, then the longest increasing contiguous segment is n. Then we set candidate_ans = n.\n\n        However, we can also have a candidate that is n (the entire array) even if the array is not initially increasing, provided that we can fix one violation and the entire array becomes increasing. But wait, the entire array might have two violations, then we cannot fix two with one change.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, after changing at most one element, the subsegment becomes strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments that can be made strictly increasing with a single change.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index.\n\n2. **Check Entire Array**: \n   - If the entire array is already strictly increasing, the answer is the length of the array.\n\n3. **Check for Violations**:\n   - For each adjacent pair where `a[i] >= a[i+1]`, consider two scenarios:\n     - **Fixing the Current Element (`a[i]`)**: Check if merging the left increasing subsegment (ending at `i-1`) and the right increasing subsegment (starting at `i+1`) is possible by ensuring `a[i-1] < a[i+1]`. The candidate length is `left_arr[i-1] + 1 + right_arr[i+1]`.\n     - **Fixing the Next Element (`a[i+1]`)**: The candidate length is `left_arr[i] + right_arr[i+1]`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the violation is at the start or end of the array separately.\n\n5. **Determine Maximum Length**: \n   - Compare all candidate lengths (from both violation scenarios and the entire array) to find the maximum valid subsegment length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = 1\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            continue\n            \n        cand1 = 0\n        cand2 = 0\n        \n        if i == 0:\n            cand1 = 1 + right_arr[i+1]\n        else:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                cand1 = left_arr[i-1] + 1 + right_arr[i+1]\n                \n        if i < n-1:\n            cand2 = left_arr[i] + right_arr[i+1]\n            \n        if cand1 > ans:\n            ans = cand1\n        if cand2 > ans:\n            ans = cand2\n            \n    max_increasing = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        seg_len = left_arr[i] + (right_arr[i] if i < n-1 else 0)\n        if seg_len > max_increasing:\n            max_increasing = seg_len\n            \n    if max_increasing > ans:\n        ans = max_increasing\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the array size and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of the longest strictly increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Violation Handling**: For each adjacent pair that violates the strictly increasing condition, two potential solutions are considered: fixing the current element or the next element.
