After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means having the highest mark in that subject).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? But note the problem says \"best\" if no student has a higher mark.\n    So, if two or more have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n However, note: we cannot simply take the maximum per subject because we need to know the maximum per subject and then check for each student if in at least one subject they have that maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Create a matrix (list of lists) of integers from the input strings.\n   - For each subject j (column), find the maximum value (as integer) and also note which students achieved that maximum.\n\n But note: the problem says the marks are from '1' to '9'. We can work with characters but easier to convert to integers for comparison.\n\n However, we can do without converting to integers? Actually, we can compare the characters because '1' < '2' etc. but note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9.\n\n But wait: what if we have a tie? Then we have multiple bests. So we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read the grid as list of strings, then maybe convert each string to a list of integers, or keep as characters.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          # We can split the string into characters? Or just use list of chars.\n          # Since the input is given without spaces, we can just use the entire string as a list of m characters.\n          gradebook.append(s)\n\n   Now, we can create a list `max_marks` for each subject (column) of length m, but actually we need the maximum mark for each column.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      max_per_subject = [0] * m   # but we don't know the maximum until we see all, so we can do:\n\n      for j in range(m):\n          col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n          max_val = max(col)   # this is a character, but we can compare characters. But note: the marks are digits, so we can compare by their character value.\n\n   However, we can also convert to integers if we wish. But since the problem is small (n, m <= 100), it doesn't matter.\n\n   But note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so they are single-digit numbers.\n\n   Then, for each student i, we can check: for any subject j, is gradebook[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]?\n\n   However, wait: if two students have the same maximum mark in a subject, then both are best. So we don't need to check only the maximum value, we need to check if the student's mark in subject j is equal to the maximum of that subject.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"best\" if there is no student with a higher mark. So if a student has the maximum mark, then he is best (even if others have the same). If a student has a lower mark, then he is not best.\n\n   So for a subject j, let max_j = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   Then for a student i, if for any j: gradebook[i][j] == max_j, then the student is successful.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the problem does not require to count distinct subjects per student, just at least one.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      grid = []\n      for _ in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n      # Precompute the maximum for each column (subject)\n      max_cols = [0] * m\n      for j in range(m):\n          col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n          max_cols[j] = max(col_vals)\n\n      # Now, for each student (row), check if there is at least one column j such that grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]\n      count_successful = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          successful = False\n          for j in range(m):\n              if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                  successful = True\n                  break\n          if successful:\n              count_successful += 1\n\n      print(count_successful)\n\n   Let's test with the first sample: \n        Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112']\n\n        n=3, m=3\n        grid = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        max_cols[0] = max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n        max_cols[1] = max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n        max_cols[2] = max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n        Now check each student:\n          Student0: '2' (subject0: '2' matches max_cols[0]'2') -> successful.\n          Student1: \n             subject0: '2' matches -> successful.\n          Student2:\n             subject0: '1' != '2'\n             subject1: '1' != '3'\n             subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n        So output is 2.\n\n   Second sample: \n        Input: ['3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        Compute max_cols for each column:\n          col0: max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n          col1: max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n          col2: max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n          col3: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n          col4: max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n        Check each student:\n          Student0: '9' (col0) -> matches '9' -> successful.\n          Student1:\n             col0: '1' != '9'\n             col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n          Student2:\n             col0: '1' != '9'\n             col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. But we are reading with input().strip(), so that should be safe.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Edge cases: \n        n=1, m=1: one student, one subject. Then if the mark is the max (which is itself) then successful.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n        Output: 1.\n\n   Another edge: \n        All students have the same mark in every subject. Then for each subject, the max is that mark, and every student will have that mark in every subject. \n        Then each student is best in every subject. So all are successful.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n11\\n11\"\n\n        max_cols = ['1','1'] (for two subjects)\n        Student0: subject0: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n                subject1: '1' == '1' -> successful (but we break at the first one).\n        Student1: same.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: We are reading from stdin.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as a list of strings. But the problem says the first line is two integers, then n lines.\n\n   We'll read the first line and split, then read n lines.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But when we run the program, we get the input from standard input. So we don't have to worry about the outer list.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Important: We must use sys.stdin if the input comes from a file? No, the problem says from standard input.\n\n   We can simply:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   But the problem says: first line contains two integers, then n lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      first_line = input().split()\n      n = int(first_line[0])\n      m = int(first_line[1])\n\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   This is straightforward.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given without spaces. So we can safely read the entire line and strip.\n\n   Code:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n      # Then proceed.\n\n   This is clear.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input might be provided as a string that includes the newline. Our strip() takes care of leading/trailing whitespace including newlines.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines each contain `m` characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_cols = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_cols[j] = max(col_vals)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from standard input. The first line is split into `n` and `m`, representing the number of students and subjects, respectively. The next `n` lines are read into a list called `grid`, where each element is a string representing a student's marks.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks:** For each subject (column index `j`), the maximum mark is determined by examining all entries in that column across all students.\n3. **Checking Successful Students:** For each student (row index `i`), we check each subject (column index `j`). If the student's mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject, they are counted as successful, and we move to the next student.\n4. **Output:** The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
