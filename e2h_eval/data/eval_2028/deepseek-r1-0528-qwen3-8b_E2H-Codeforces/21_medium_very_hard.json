The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) and one of m integers (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open a chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning they must have opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd.\n   If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\n We can separate the chests and keys by parity:\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of even a_i\n   Chestes_odd = number of odd a_i\n\n   Keys_even = number of even b_j\n   Keys_odd = number of number of odd b_j\n\n Now, consider:\n   Even chests can only be opened by odd keys.\n   Odd chests can only be opened by even keys.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   Matching 1: Even chests with odd keys.\n   Matching 2: Odd chests with even keys.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice, and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n However, the problem does not require matching all possible pairs. We just want the maximum number of chests.\n\n Since the constraints are up to 10^5, we cannot do a full bipartite matching (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS based) because that might be too slow.\n\n Observation: The condition is only about parity. We don't need to know which specific key goes to which chest, only the counts.\n\n In fact, we can use the following greedy assignment:\n\n For the even chests (which require odd keys): the maximum number of even chests we can open is limited by the minimum of (number of even chests, number of odd keys). However, wait: but the keys are shared between two sets? Actually, no, because the odd keys can only open even chests, and even keys can only open odd chests. So:\n\n   Let x = min(Chestes_even, Keys_odd)   -> from even chests to odd keys\n   Let y = min(Chestes_odd, Keys_even)   -> from odd chests to even keys\n\n Then the answer would be x + y?\n\n But wait, is that always the case? \n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: [14,6,2] -> 3; odd: [9,11] -> 2.\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] -> 3; odd: [7] -> 1.\n\n   Then x = min(3,1) = 1, y = min(2,3)=2, so total 3. Matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even (5), Keys: [5] -> odd (1).\n   Then x = min(5,1)=1, y = min(0,0)=0 -> total 1. Correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even (1), Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even (4). Then x = min(1,0)=0, y = min(0,4)=0 -> total 0. Correct.\n\n However, let's test with an example where the numbers don't add up:\n\n Example 4: \n   Chests: [1,2] -> even:1, odd:1.\n   Keys: [3,4] -> even:1, odd:1.\n\n   Then x = min(1,1)=1, y=min(1,1)=1 -> total 2. But is that correct?\n   Condition: \n     Chest 1 (odd) requires even key: we have key 4 (even) -> valid.\n     Chest 2 (even) requires odd key: we have key 3 (odd) -> valid.\n   So yes, we can open both.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Count the number of even and odd in the chests.\n   Step 2: Count the number of even and odd in the keys.\n   Step 3: The maximum chests we can open is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait, what if there are more keys than needed in one category? We are only limited by the smaller side.\n\n This is exactly the bipartite matching on two independent sets (the two types of chests are independent and the two types of keys are independent). Since each chest of a given parity can only be matched with keys of the complementary parity, and the matching is one-to-one, the maximum matching is indeed the minimum of the two sides for each bipartite graph.\n\n However, note that the keys are partitioned into two sets (even and odd) and the chests into two sets (even and odd). And the edges only go from even-chests to odd-keys and from odd-chests to even-keys.\n\n Therefore, the above formula holds.\n\n Code accordingly:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list a of n integers\n   Read list b of m integers\n\n   even_chest = count of even numbers in a\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = count of even numbers in b\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n Print the result.\n\n Let me test with the examples again.\n\n Example 1: \n   n=5, m=4\n   a = [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: 14,6,2 -> 3; odd: 9,11 -> 2.\n   b = [8,4,7,20] -> even: 8,4,20 -> 3; odd:7->1.\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1+2 = 3.\n\n Example 2:\n   n=5, m=1\n   a = [2,4,6,8,10] -> even:5, odd:0.\n   b = [5] -> even:0, odd:1.\n   result = min(5,1)+min(0,0)=1+0=1.\n\n Example 3:\n   n=1, m=4\n   a=[10] -> even:1, odd:0.\n   b=[20,30,40,50] -> even:4, odd:0.\n   result = min(1,0)+min(0,4)=0+0=0.\n\n It matches.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers can be as large as 10^9, but we only care about parity, so we can do:\n\n   for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0: then even_chest++\n\n   Similarly for keys.\n\n But note: negative numbers? The problem states: \"1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^9\", so non-negative, so modulus is safe.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means they must have opposite parity (one even and one odd). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The condition for a valid match is that the chest and key must have different parities (one even and one odd).\n2. **Intuition**: Chests with even numbers can only be opened by keys with odd numbers, and vice versa. Therefore, the solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and keys separately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element in the chests and keys lists exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys have even and odd numbers. This is done by checking each number's parity using modulo operation.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. These two values are summed to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without needing complex matching algorithms, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
