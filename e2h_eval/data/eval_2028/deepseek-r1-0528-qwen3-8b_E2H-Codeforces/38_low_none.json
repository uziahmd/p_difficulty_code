    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph.\n   and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with n nodes.\n\n Conditions for p-reachable:\n   The graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and there is a path from u to v and from v to u.\n\n Note: In a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k, the condition (u < v and mutual reachability) is satisfied for every pair (u, v) with u < v in that SCC. However, note that the problem says \"exactly p\", so we are counting unordered pairs (with u < v) that are mutually reachable. But note: the definition of the graph being p-reachable requires exactly p such pairs.\n\n However, note that the problem also allows the graph to have more than one SCC? But wait: the condition is about having exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability. \n\n Let's break down:\n\n In a directed graph, we can decompose it into strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, the mutual reachability condition (forming a strongly connected component) is defined within an SCC. Moreover, the entire graph might be one big SCC or multiple.\n\n However, note the problem requires exactly p such pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability. \n\n How many such pairs are there?\n   In an SCC of size k, the number of pairs (u, v) with u < v is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n But note: the graph might have several SCCs. Then, the total number of pairs (u < v and mutual reachability) is the sum over each SCC of C(k_i, 2). \n\n However, the graph must be such that the entire graph has exactly p such pairs.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be strongly connected. It just requires that the total number of mutual pairs (with u < v) is p.\n\n Therefore, we are to assign the nodes to several SCCs (each node in one SCC) such that the sum of C(k_i,2) for all SCCs is p.\n\n However, note: the graph must be built with the minimum number of nodes. Also, we are allowed to arrange edges arbitrarily as long as the mutual reachability conditions hold.\n\n Important: The graph must be p-reachable, meaning the total number of mutual pairs (with u < v) is exactly p.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the graph must be connected. So we can have multiple SCCs.\n\n We are to minimize the total number of nodes. Then, given the minimum number of nodes, we want the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n What is a unidirectional pair?\n   An ordered pair (u, v) (with u != v) such that there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n Note: The entire graph is built with n nodes.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the minimum n such that there exists a decomposition of n into some positive integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m (each k_i>=1) with \n        sum_{i} [k_i*(k_i-1)//2] = p.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that the entire graph is one SCC. We can have multiple SCCs. And the condition is exactly p.\n\n    But note: the graph must be built with n nodes, and the condition is that the total mutual pairs (which is the sum over SCCs of C(k_i,2)) equals p.\n\n    However, we can also have edges between SCCs. But note: if two SCCs are arranged in a linear order (say, A -> B), then there is a path from A to B but not from B to A. This does not add to the mutual pairs (because mutual pairs only count within an SCC). However, the unidirectional pairs will include these inter-component edges.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"a directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". \n\n    This condition is independent of the edges between SCCs. The mutual reachability is defined by being in the same SCC. So the entire graph's mutual pairs (for u<v) is the sum of C(k_i,2) for each SCC.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not say the graph must be maximal. So we can have any graph as long as the mutual pairs (within the same SCC) sum to p.\n\n    But note: we are free to choose the structure of the graph (the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and there is a path from u to v and vice versa. This condition implies that the graph must decompose into strongly connected components (SCCs) such that the sum of combinations of nodes within each SCC equals p. Specifically, for an SCC of size k, the number of mutual pairs is \\( \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Minimum Nodes Calculation**: The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes n such that the sum of \\( \\binom{k_i}{2} \\) for all SCCs (where \\( k_i \\) are the sizes of the SCCs) equals p. This involves partitioning n into integers \\( k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m \\) such that their combined mutual pairs sum to p, and n is minimized.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal n is found, the next step is to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u). This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear order and adding all possible edges between them, which maximizes the unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    p = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    total = 0\n    while total < p:\n        n += 1\n        total += (n*(n-1))//2\n        \n    if total == p:\n        print(f\"{n} 0\")\n    else:\n        n -= 1\n        total_prev = (n*(n-1))//2\n        \n        def find_min_nodes(p):\n            n_val = 0\n            total_pairs = 0\n            while total_pairs < p:\n                n_val += 1\n                total_pairs += (n_val*(n_val-1))//2\n            return n_val - 1, total_pairs - (n_val*(n_val-1)//2)\n        \n        base_n, remaining = find_min_nodes(p)\n        if remaining == 0:\n            print(f\"{base_n} 0\")\n            return\n            \n        def count_unidirectional(base_n, remaining):\n            unidirectional = 0\n            current = base_n\n            while remaining > 0:\n                if current == 0:\n                    break\n                if remaining >= (current*(current-1))//2:\n                    remaining -= (current*(current-1))//2\n                    unidirectional += current\n                    current -= 1\n                else:\n                    remaining -= (current*(current-1))//2\n                    unidirectional += current\n                    current -= 1\n            return unidirectional * (unidirectional - 1) // 2 + remaining * unidirectional\n            \n        n_nodes = base_n + 1\n        unidirectional_count = count_unidirectional(base_n, remaining) + (remaining * base_n)\n        max_unidirectional = unidirectional_count\n        \n        print(f\"{n_nodes} {max_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the integer p, which represents the number of required mutual pairs.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution immediately returns \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed.\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The loop increments node count n until the cumulative mutual pairs (sum of \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\)) meets or exceeds p. If exactly p is reached, it prints the node count and 0 unidirectional pairs.\n4. **Adjusting Node Count**: If the exact p is not met, it adjusts n to the previous value and calculates the remaining mutual pairs needed.\n5. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: The function `count_unidirectional` calculates the maximum unidirectional pairs by distributing the remaining mutual pairs across the nodes and computing the edges between different SCCs.\n6. **Output**: The final result is the minimal node count and the maximum unidirectional pairs achievable under that constraint.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal graph structure and maximizes the desired unidirectional pairs by leveraging combinatorial mathematics and careful node distribution.",
