A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime and the drink and salt are per toast (per friend) but multiple friends will share the same toast? \n\n However, note the problem: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n This means that if we are making t toasts, then each toast is associated with one friend? Actually, the problem says \"each friend needs ... for a toast\". So if we have n friends and we want each friend to make t toasts, then we need:\n   - Drink: n * t * nl\n   - Lime slices: n * t   (each toast requires one slice, and each friend makes t toasts so each friend uses t slices -> total n*t slices)\n   - Salt: n * t * np\n\n But wait: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n In the example: \n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n According to the example: \n   Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / (3 * 3) ? Wait, no.\n\n Let me re-read the example explanation:\n\n \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" \n\n Why 3? Because each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml? But wait: the example says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", and nl=3. So one toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. However, if we are making T toasts in total (across all friends), then the total drink required is T * 3 (since each toast, regardless of which friend, requires 3 ml). \n\n But note: the example then says: \n   The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts (each toast requires one slice) and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts.\n\n Then they take the minimum of these: min(6, 80, 100) = 6, and then divide by the number of friends (3) to get 2.\n\n However, wait: if each toast requires 3 ml and there are 20 ml, then total toasts T must satisfy: T * 3 <= 20 -> T <= 20/3 ~ 6.66 -> so T=6. Then each friend can make 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n So the key is: the entire group can make at most T toasts, where T is limited by:\n\n   T_drink = (k * l) // (nl)   [because each toast requires nl ml] -> but wait, in the example, the drink is used per toast (each toast requires nl ml). However, note the condition: each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. And there are n friends. But the example does not multiply by n for the drink? \n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Each toast (one toast for one friend) requires:\n        drink: nl ml\n        lime: 1 slice\n        salt: np grams\n\n   But if we have T toasts (meaning each of the n friends makes T_i toasts, but we require that each friend makes the same number, say t, then T",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts based on the constraints imposed by the drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves computing the maximum possible toasts from each resource and then determining the limiting factor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make such that all friends drink the same amount. Each toast for a friend requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - One slice of lime.\n   - `np` grams of salt.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The total number of toasts is constrained by the most limited resource among drink, lime slices, and salt. \n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total available drink is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, so the maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total available lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum toasts from limes is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total available salt is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n\n3. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The actual number of toasts is the minimum of the three constraints calculated above. This minimum value is then divided by the number of friends `n` (since each friend must make the same number of toasts) to get the result for each friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    \n    max_toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    min_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    result = min_toasts // n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle to get the total drink available. Divide this by the milliliters required per toast to find the maximum toasts possible from the drink.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime to get the total lime slices available. Each toast requires one slice, so this gives the maximum toasts from limes.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Divide the total grams of salt by the grams required per toast to find the maximum toasts possible from salt.\n3. **Finding the Minimum**: The smallest value among the three constraints determines the actual number of toasts that can be made.\n4. **Dividing by Friends**: Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, divide the total toasts by the number of friends to get the result per friend.\n5. **Output**: Print the result, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by considering all constraints and ensuring the result is feasible for all friends equally.",
