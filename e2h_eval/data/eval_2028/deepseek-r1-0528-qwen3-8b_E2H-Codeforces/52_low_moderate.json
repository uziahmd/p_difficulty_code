Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burnt candles (which become old) to make more new ones.\n\n Steps:\n   We start by lighting all the new candles we have. Then we burn them and get some old candles.\n\n But note: we can also use the old candles to make more new ones, which then can be burned to give even more old ones.\n\n We can simulate:\n   hours = 0\n   new = a\n   old = 0\n\n   while new > 0:\n        # Burn all the new candles\n        hours += new\n        old += new\n        new = 0   # because we used all the new candles for burning\n\n        # Now, with the old candles, we can make more new ones\n        # How many new candles? old // b, and the remaining old candles after making new ones will be old % b\n        # But note: when we make new candles, we use b old candles per new candle, so we do:\n        #   new = old // b\n        #   old = old % b\n\n        # However, we don't necessarily have to set new=0 immediately after burning? Actually, we are going to use the old ones to make new.\n\n        # Let's update: \n        #   We have 'old' old candles. We can form new_candles = old // b, and then old %= b.\n\n        # But note: in the next iteration, we use the new_candles (which are now available as new) to burn again.\n\n   However, there is a catch: we might not need to wait until we have burned all the new candles to start recycling? Actually, the problem says:\n        When Vasily lights up a new candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. He can make b went out candles into a new candle.\n\n   The optimal strategy is to use all new candles we have, then recycle the old ones to get new candles, and then use those too.\n\n   But note: the example: \"4 2\" -> 7 hours.\n\n   Let's simulate with [4,2]:\n        Start: new = 4, old = 0, hours = 0.\n        Step 1: burn the 4 new candles -> hours becomes 4, old becomes 4, new becomes 0.\n                Then, from 4 old candles, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and old becomes 0 (because 4 % 2 = 0).\n        Step 2: burn the 2 new candles -> hours becomes 6, old becomes 2, new becomes 0.\n                Then, from 2 old candles, we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and old becomes 0.\n        Step 3: burn the 1 new candle -> hours becomes 7, old becomes 1, new becomes 0.\n                Then, from 1 old candle, we can make 0 new candles (since 1 < 2), so we break.\n\n   So total hours = 7.\n\n   However, the above simulation would be:\n\n        hours = 0\n        new = a\n        old = 0\n\n        while new > 0 or old >= b:   # But wait, we can only use the old candles to make new ones if we have at least b. However, we also have the new ones to burn.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate by always burning as many as we can (i.e., all new candles) and then recycling the old ones.\n\n   But note: we don't have to wait until we finish burning the current batch to start recycling? Actually, the process is:\n\n        Hour 1: burn one new candle -> becomes old, but wait, we have multiple candles. Actually, the problem states that we light a candle and it burns for an hour. But we can light multiple candles at the same time? \n\n   The problem says: Vasily has a candles. He lights a new candle (meaning one candle). Then when it burns out, he can use b old ones to make a new one.\n\n   However, note the example: \n        Input: 6 3 -> Output: 8.\n\n   Let's simulate [6,3]:\n        Start: new=6, old=0, hours=0.\n        Step 1: burn the 6 new",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for exactly one hour, and after burning, it becomes an old candle. Every `b` old candles can be recycled into a new candle, which can then be burned again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero old candles. The total hours initially is zero.\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available new candles. Each burn adds one hour to the total. After burning, these new candles become old candles.\n3. **Recycling Old Candles**: Convert as many old candles as possible into new candles. Specifically, every `b` old candles can be converted into one new candle. The remaining old candles (after conversion) are carried forward.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more new candles left to burn and not enough old candles to form a new candle (i.e., fewer than `b` old candles remain).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling the burnt ones until no more candles can be used, ensuring the maximum number of hours is calculated.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    hours = 0\n    new_candles = a\n    old_candles = 0\n    \n    while new_candles > 0:\n        hours += new_candles\n        old_candles += new_candles\n        new_candles = old_candles // b\n        old_candles = old_candles % b\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of old candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initial Setup**: Initialize `hours` to zero, `new_candles` to `a`, and `old_candles` to zero.\n3. **Loop Until No New Candles**: While there are new candles:\n   - **Burn Candles**: Add the number of new candles to the total hours. These burnt candles become old candles.\n   - **Recycle Old Candles**: Calculate how many new candles can be made from the old candles (`old_candles // b`). The remainder old candles are updated (`old_candles % b`).\n4. **Output Result**: After the loop terminates, print the total hours.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by leveraging division and modulus operations to handle the recycling process, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
