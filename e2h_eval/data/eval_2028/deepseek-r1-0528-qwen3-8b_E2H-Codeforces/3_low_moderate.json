Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap in the middle is from a_i + d to a_{i+1} - d.\n        To cover the entire street, the light from one lantern must extend to the next. So the distance between the two lanterns is (a_{i+1} - a_i). \n        The light from the left lantern must cover up to at least a_{i+1} - d, so the condition is: d must be at least (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for the gap to be covered?\n\n Actually, note: the requirement is that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For the left edge (from 0 to the first lantern):\n   The first lantern is at position a0. The light must reach 0. Therefore, the radius d must be at least a0/2 (if we center the light at the lantern, then from a0 to 0 is a0, so half of that is needed).\n\n For the right edge (from the last lantern to l):\n   The last lantern is at position a_n-1. The light must reach l. Therefore, d must be at least (l - a_n-1)/2.\n\n For the gaps between lanterns (between a_i and a_{i+1}):\n   The two adjacent lanterns must cover the entire segment from a_i to a_{i+1}. \n   The left lantern covers from a_i - d to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d to a_{i+1} + d.\n   The entire segment from a_i to a_{i+1} is covered if there is no gap between the lights. That is, the light from the left lantern must extend at least to a_{i+1} - d, so:\n        a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d\n        => 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i\n        => d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2\n\n However, note: we don't require the entire segment between two lanterns to have a continuous light? Actually, the whole street must be lit. But note that the lanterns can be overlapping.\n\n But wait: consider two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b). The left lantern must light up to a+d, and the right lantern starts lighting from b-d. We require that the entire interval [a, b] is covered. The critical point is the midpoint? Actually, the coverage from the left lantern goes from a-d to a+d, and the right from b-d to b+d. The gap between the two lights is from a+d to b-d. We require that this gap is non-positive? Not exactly: the entire street must be covered, but note that the street is from 0 to l.\n\n Actually, the condition for covering the street is that every point x in [0, l] must satisfy that there exists a lantern at position a_i such that |x - a_i| <= d.\n\n How do we compute the minimum d?\n\n We can think of it as:\n\n 1. The leftmost unlit point is 0, so the first lantern must cover 0. The required d for the first lantern is at least (a0 - 0) / 2? Actually, no: the lantern at a0 can cover from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we need a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But wait, if we set d = a0, then the lantern covers from 0 to 2*a0. However, note: the problem does not require that the lantern must cover beyond the street. Actually, the condition is that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n However, note: the example input \"2 5\\n2 5\": \n   With d=2, the first lantern at 2 covers [0,4] and the second at 5 covers [3,7]. But 4 and 3 overlap, and together they cover [0,7]. Since the street is only [0,5], the entire street is covered",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point 0 to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between lantern positions and ensuring that the light coverage from each lantern adequately covers these gaps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the given lantern positions to process them in order from left to right.\n2. **Check Leftmost and Rightmost Ends**: \n   - The leftmost end of the street (0) must be covered by the first lantern. The required radius here is half the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street.\n   - Similarly, the rightmost end of the street (`l`) must be covered by the last lantern. The required radius here is half the distance from the end of the street to the last lantern.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap that needs to be covered is between the point where the first lantern's light ends and the point where the next lantern's light begins. The required radius to cover this gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The overall minimum radius `d` is the maximum value among the three scenarios mentioned above (leftmost end, rightmost end, and gaps between lanterns).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    d_candidate = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the left part: from 0 to the first lantern\n    if positions[0] > 0:\n        d_candidate = max(d_candidate, positions[0] / 2.0)\n        \n    # Check the right part: from the last lantern to l\n    if positions[-1] < l:\n        d_candidate = max(d_candidate, (l - positions[-1]) / 2.0)\n        \n    # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(len(positions) - 1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        if gap > 0:\n            d_candidate = max(d_candidate, gap / 2.0)\n            \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_candidate))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order, which simplifies gap analysis.\n3. **Leftmost Check**: If the first lantern is not at position 0, the required radius is at least half the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern.\n4. **Rightmost Check**: If the last lantern is not at position `l`, the required radius is at least half the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n5. **Gap Check**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them is divided by 2 to find the minimum radius needed to ensure their light coverage overlaps completely, thus covering the gap between them.\n6. **Output Result**: The maximum value obtained from the three checks is printed as the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.",
