Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters.\n Conditions for \"YES\":\n 1. On both diagonals (the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal) all letters are the same.\n 2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n Steps:\n - Read n.\n - Read the grid.\n\n Let the two diagonals be:\n   Main diagonal: positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n   Anti-diagonal: positions (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n Condition 1: Every character on the main diagonal must be the same, and every character on the anti-diagonal must be the same.\n Condition 2: The letter on the diagonals must be the same? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\" (so two sets) but they might be two different letters? \n However, the example outputs: \n   Input: 3x3 with 'w','s','w' in first row, 's','w','s' in second, 'w','s','w' in third -> YES.\n But wait, the example input is: \n      3\n      wsw\n      sws\n      wsw\n\n In this example, the main diagonal is ['w', 'w', 'w'] and the anti-diagonal is ['w', 'w', 'w'].\n\n However, consider if the diagonals had two different letters? The problem states:\n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n So the entire main diagonal must be one letter, say 'X', and the entire anti-diagonal must be one letter, say 'Y'. \n Then condition 2: all other squares must be the same letter, say 'Z', and 'Z' must be different from both 'X' and 'Y'.\n\n But note: what if 'X' and 'Y' are the same? Then we have two possibilities: either the entire X (which is the same as Y) is the diagonal letter, and the rest must be a different letter.\n\n However, the example input does not specify that the diagonals must be the same letter. It just says each diagonal has the same letter. They can be different.\n\n But let's read the problem statement: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" -> meaning the main diagonal has one letter (say A) and the anti-diagonal has one letter (say B). \n   Then, \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\" -> meaning the other squares must be the same letter (say C) and C must be different from A and also from B.\n\n Therefore, the diagonals can have two different letters. But note: if the two diagonals have two different letters, then the rest of the letters must be a third letter.\n\n However, consider: what if the entire grid is such that the two diagonals are the same letter? Then the rest must be a different letter.\n\n So the conditions are independent: \n   Condition 1: Check the two diagonals: \n        Let d1 = set of letters on main diagonal -> should have only one distinct letter (say A)\n        Let d2 = set of letters on anti-diagonal -> should have only one distinct letter (say B)\n\n   Condition 2: For every cell not on the diagonals, the letter must be the same (say C) and C != A and C != B.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the two diagonals have the same letter. They can be different.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n Step 2: Extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\n Step 3: Check that the main diagonal has only one unique letter (call it A) and the anti-diagonal has only one unique letter (call it B). \n         But note: if the two diagonals are the same? Then we have A=B. Then the rest must be a letter C != A.\n\n Step 4: Check that for every cell not in the diagonals, the letter is the same and that letter is not A and not B.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might be the same (A==B) or different (A != B). In both cases, the rest must be a single letter and different from A and B.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3\n        www\n        wwww\n        www\n\n   But wait, let me clarify: \n        Main diagonal: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] -> ['w','w','w']\n        Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0]] -> ['w','w','w']",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid (an odd number). Then, read the next `n` lines to form the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** Extract the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`). Verify that all elements in each diagonal are identical.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements:** Ensure that all elements not on either diagonal are identical and different from the letters found on the diagonals.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    main_diag = set()\n    anti_diag = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        main_diag.add(grid[i][i])\n        anti_diag.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n        \n    if len(main_diag) != 1 or len(anti_diag) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_letter1 = next(iter(main_diag))\n    diag_letter2 = next(iter(anti_diag))\n    \n    non_diagonal_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diagonal_letter is None:\n                non_diagonal_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diagonal_letter == diag_letter1 or non_diagonal_letter == diag_letter2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and then reads each line of the grid into a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Check:** It collects all characters on the main diagonal (positions `(i, i)`) and anti-diagonal (positions `(i, n-1-i)`)) into sets. If either set contains more than one distinct character, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** For every cell not on the diagonals, the code checks that all such cells contain the same character. If any cell differs, it prints \"NO\". Additionally, this character must differ from those on the diagonals.\n4. **Result:** If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\", and the code outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming the letter \"X\" by leveraging set operations for diagonal checks and nested loops for non-diagonal validation.",
