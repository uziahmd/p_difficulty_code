Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   current_old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the old candles to make more new ones.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We start with 'a' new candles. This gives us 'a' hours and then we get 'a' old candles.\n\n   Then, we can use the old candles to make new ones. Specifically, while we have at least 'b' old candles, \n   we can convert them into new candles. But note: the process can be done repeatedly.\n\n Let's break down:\n   Step 1: Use all the initial candles (a). This gives a hours and a old candles.\n   Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from the old ones, and the remaining old candles (a % b) will be left.\n\n   Now, we have the new candles (which we just made) that we can use. So we add these new candles to our total and they will burn for another set of hours.\n\n   Actually, we can simulate:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But a simpler way is:\n\n   total_hours = a   (because we use the initial a candles for a hours)\n   Then, we have a old candles.\n\n   Then, while current_new_candles + leftover >= b? Actually, we should track two things: the number of new candles we have (which we can burn) and the leftover old candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = a\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, after burning the first a candles, we have a leftover (old) candles.\n\n   Then, we can form new_candles = candles // b, and the remainder is candles % b.\n\n   Then we set candles = new_candles, and leftover = candles % b, then total += candles, and then we set candles to the new_candles (which we just made) and continue?\n\n   Actually, we can combine:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        total += current   # because we can burn all current candles for 'current' hours\n        # Then, we get 'current' old candles, and we can form new candles from the old ones and any leftovers from previous steps?\n        # But wait, we have to account for the leftovers from previous cycles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can keep a variable for the total old candles.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n   But actually, we can do:\n\n   total_hours = a\n   remaining_old = a   # because after burning a new candles, we have a old candles.\n\n   Then, while remaining_old >= b:\n        new_candles_from_old = remaining_old // b\n        remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_candles_from_old   # because the new_candles_from_old become old when burned\n\n        total_hours += new_candles_from_old\n\n   However, wait: we are using the old candles to make new ones, but then we burn those new ones and they become old. But note: we don't have to wait until we have no more old candles to start burning the new ones we just made.\n\n   Actually, the above loop does:\n\n        total_hours starts at a (the initial burn)\n        Then we have 'a' old candles.\n\n        Then, we take those 'a' old candles and convert them into new ones: \n            new_candles = a // b\n            remaining_old = a % b   (leftover old candles) plus the new_candles (which we will burn and then become old)\n\n        Then we add the new_candles to total_hours (so total_hours becomes a + (a//b))\n\n        Then we set remaining_old to (a % b + new_candles) and continue.\n\n   This matches the example: \n        Input: \"4 2\"\n        Start: total_hours = 4, remaining_old = 4.\n        First iteration: 4 // 2 = 2, 4 % 2 = 0 -> remaining_old = 0 + 2 = 2, total_hours = 4+2 = 6.\n        Second iteration: 2 // 2 = 1, 2 % 2 = 0 -> remaining_old = 0+1 = 1, total",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to create new candles from the leftover burned ones. The key insight is that each time a candle burns for an hour, it becomes a leftover candle. These leftovers can be combined to form new candles, which in turn can be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial number of candles (a). Each candle burns for one hour, so the initial total hours is simply a.\n2. **Recycling Leftovers**: After burning all initial candles, you have 'a' leftover candles. These leftovers can be converted into new candles at a rate of b leftovers per new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of converting leftovers into new candles. Each time you convert leftovers, add the number of new candles to the total hours. Then, update the leftover count by combining the remaining leftovers from the previous conversion with the new leftovers generated from burning the newly created candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when there are fewer than b leftovers left, as no more new candles can be formed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by leveraging the recycling of leftover candles, ensuring optimal usage of all available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    \n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        current_old = current_candles\n        current_candles = current_old // b\n        leftover = current_old % b\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, a (initial candles) and b (number of leftovers needed to make a new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` keeps track of the total burning time, starting with the initial candles. `current_candles` holds the number of candles available for burning in each iteration.\n3. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn. In each iteration:\n   - The current number of candles is added to `total_hours`.\n   - The leftovers from burning these candles are calculated (`current_old % b`).\n   - New candles are formed from the leftovers (`current_old // b`), and the process repeats with the new candles.\n4. **Output**: The loop exits when no more candles can be formed from the leftovers, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis method ensures that all possible candles are utilized, maximizing the burning time through efficient recycling of leftovers.",
