    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element might change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` (after sorting). Then the overall instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n However, we are allowed to remove one element. We can consider two types of removals:\n  1. Removing an occurrence of the minimum element (if there are multiple minima, removing one might leave others).\n  2. Removing an occurrence of the maximum element.\n\n But note: sometimes the best removal is not necessarily at the ends. Actually, let's think:\n\n After removal, the new array will have a new min and/or max.\n\n Consider: \n  Let the sorted array be `b`.\n  If we remove an element, then the new min is either:\n      - the old min (if we didn't remove the last occurrence of the old min) OR\n      - the next smallest element (if we removed the old min and there was only one occurrence)\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the same element to be the only one; we can remove any one.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the instability is determined by the max and min, we can consider:\n\n  Option 1: Remove the first occurrence (min) -> then the new min might be the next distinct value? Not exactly.\n\n Instead, we can consider all possibilities by looking at the endpoints of the sorted array.\n\n Actually, note: The entire instability of the remaining array is determined by two numbers: the min and the max of the remaining set.\n\n The candidate removals that can affect the instability are the ones that are either the min or the max.\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n Therefore, we only need to consider removals that are either the min or the max.\n\n However, consider: what if the array has duplicates? Then removing one duplicate might not change the min or the max.\n\n So we can do:\n\n  Sort the array.\n\n  Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n  The original instability is b[-1] - b[0].\n\n  Now, we are going to try removing each occurrence that is either the global min or the global max.\n\n  But note: if we remove one occurrence, then the new array's min and max might change.\n\n  How many distinct removals do we need to consider?\n\n  Actually, we don't need to remove every occurrence. We can consider:\n\n  Candidate 1: Remove the first element (the smallest) and then the instability becomes b[-1] - b[1] (if n>2, but if n==2 then after removal we have one element, so instability 0).\n\n  Candidate 2: Remove the last element (the largest) and then the instability becomes b[-2] - b[0].\n\n  But wait: what if we remove an occurrence of the min that is not the first element? Actually, if there are multiple minima, then removing one of them (any) doesn't change the min. Similarly for the max.\n\n  Therefore, we should consider:\n\n    Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (then the new min is the next smallest distinct value? Actually, no: if there are multiple smallest, then the min remains the same until we remove all of them). But note: we are removing exactly one element.\n\n    Actually, the min after removal is:\n        if the element we remove is the only occurrence of the current min, then the new min becomes the next distinct value (which is the next element in the sorted array that is greater than the min). But wait: the array is sorted, so the next distinct value is the first element that is greater than the min.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n        For each index i from 0 to n-1, consider removing the element at that index.\n\n        Then the new min = min(b without b[i]) = \n            if i==0: then min becomes b[1] (if n>=2) because the first element is gone.\n            if i==n-1: then min remains b[0] (if n>=2) because the first element is still there.\n\n        Similarly for max.\n\n    However, we cannot iterate over all n elements (n up to 10^5) and compute the entire min and max for the entire array without that element (because that would be O(n) per removal, leading to O(n^2)).\n\n  We need an efficient way.\n\n  Let me reframe:\n\n  The instability of the array after removal is: max_remaining - min_remaining.\n\n  We know the entire sorted array. The removal of one element will:\n\n      - If we remove an element that is not the unique minimum, the minimum remains the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: The first step is to sort the given array. This allows us to easily access the minimum and maximum elements, which are crucial for calculating the instability.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: \n   - If the array has only two elements, removing either element will result in a single-element array with zero instability.\n   - If all elements in the array are the same, removing any element will leave all other elements unchanged, resulting in zero instability.\n3. **Calculate Instability After Removal**: For each possible removal of the first or last element in the sorted array, compute the new instability:\n   - **Removing the First Element**: The new minimum becomes the second element, and the maximum remains the last element. The instability is then `last_element - second_element`.\n   - **Removing the Last Element**: The new maximum becomes the second-to-last element, and the minimum remains the first element. The instability is `second_last_element - first_element`.\n4. **Find Minimum Instability**: Compare the instabilities obtained from the above two scenarios and choose the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    \n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily identify the minimum (`arr[0]`) and maximum (`arr[-1]`) elements.\n2. **Edge Handling**: \n   - If the array size is 2, removing any element leaves a single-element array with zero instability.\n   - If all elements are identical, removing any element still leaves identical elements, resulting in zero instability.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Removing the Minimum**: The instability becomes the difference between the original maximum and the next smallest element (`arr[-1] - arr[1]`).\n   - **Removing the Maximum**: The instability becomes the difference between the next largest element and the original minimum (`arr[-2] - arr[0]`).\n4. **Result Selection**: The solution prints the smaller of the two calculated instabilities, ensuring the minimal possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only the relevant elements (the first and last) in the sorted array, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to find the optimal solution. The complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
