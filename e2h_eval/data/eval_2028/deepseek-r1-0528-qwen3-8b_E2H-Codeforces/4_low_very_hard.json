The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are repeated cyclically. Let:\n   m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n In one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., when we have gone through a common multiple of m and k rounds?),\n but actually we don't need a common multiple for the entire game because we are going to break down the rounds.\n\n However, note: In each round i (0-indexed), we use:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n We can break the n rounds into two parts: \n   - The first min(m*k, n) rounds might not form a complete cycle of the pair (A,B) if n is less than m*k.\n   - But note: we can also consider cycles of length LCM(m,k) to avoid having to handle two different cycles?\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the outcome for one period of the combined cycle (which is LCM(m,k)), then multiply by the number of full periods and then add the remaining rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the outcome of a round i depends on (A[i % m], B[i % k]).\n 2. We can precompute the outcomes for all pairs (x,y) where x in ['R','S','P'] and y in ['R','S','P'].\n\n    Outcome for (x, y):\n        - If x == y: draw -> no loss.\n        - Else:\n            Rock (x) beats Scissors (y): so if x=='R' and y=='S', then x wins -> no loss for x, loss for y.\n            Similarly, if x=='S' and y=='P': x wins -> no loss for x, loss for y.\n            If x=='P' and y=='R': x wins -> no loss for x, loss for y.\n\n            Otherwise, y wins: so if x=='R' and y=='P': then x loses (so x gets a red spot) and y doesn't.\n            Similarly, x=='S' and y=='R': x loses.\n            x=='P' and y=='S': x loses.\n\n 3. But note: the problem counts a red spot for the loser. So we need to count:\n        For each round i: \n            if A[i%m] vs B[i%k] results in a loss for Nikephoros (who uses A) then we add one to his red spots.\n            similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n 4. We can group the rounds by the two indices (i mod m, i mod k). However, note that the same pair (a, b) can appear at multiple rounds.\n\n How many times does a particular pair (a, b) appear in n rounds?\n\n Actually, we can use the concept of the least common multiple of m and k. The combined sequence of (A[i%m], B[i%k]) repeats every T = LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n So, let T = LCM(m, k). Then, in T rounds, each pair (a, b) (where a is from A and b is from B) appears exactly how many times?\n\n Actually, note: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1. The pair (A[i%m], B[i%k]) will repeat every T rounds.\n\n But note: the mapping from i to (i%m, i%k) is such that the pairs (i mod m, i mod k) are periodic with period T.\n\n However, the entire sequence of pairs (for i from 0 to T-1) will cover all pairs (x,y) such that x is in A and y is in B? Not exactly: we are just cycling through the indices.\n\n Actually, the set of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i=0,...,T-1 is such that for each residue class modulo m and modulo k, the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that T is the smallest number such that i mod m and i mod k cover all combinations of residues that are consistent (but note: the residues for m and k are independent). However, the total distinct pairs (i mod m, i mod k) is at most T, and T = LCM(m,k).\n\n But note: we are not iterating over all possible (x,y) from the entire set of 3x3, but only those (x,y) that appear in A and B. However, the entire set of pairs (x,y) that appear is the set of (A[i%m], B[i%k]) for i=0,...,T-1.\n\n How to count the frequency of a specific pair (a,b) in the T rounds? \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to compute the result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using their own cyclic sequence of moves (rock, paper, or scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current move from each sequence. The challenge is to count the total losses over `n` rounds without processing each round individually.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined sequence repeats every `T = LCM(m, k)` rounds. Within one period `T`, the outcomes of all possible pairs of moves (from the sequences) are determined. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the least common multiple of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period `T`.\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each round within one period `T`, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and count how many times each outcome occurs.\n   - **Scaling Up**: Multiply the counts from one period by the number of full periods in `n` rounds. Then, handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by breaking the problem into manageable periods. The preprocessing step involves analyzing up to `T` rounds, where `T` is the LCM of `m` and `k`. Given that `m` and `k` are at most 1000, `T` is at most 1,000,000, which is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    def outcome(x, y):\n        if x == y:\n            return 0, 0\n        elif (x, y) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 0, 1\n        else:\n            return 1, 0\n    \n    count_period = [0] * (3*3)\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        nike_loss, poly_loss = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        idx = ord(a_char) - ord('R') + 3 * (ord(b_char) - ord('R'))\n        if idx < 0 or idx >= 9:\n            continue\n        count_period[idx] += 1\n        \n    full_periods = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    nike_total = 0\n    poly_total = 0\n    for idx in range(len(count_period)):\n        count_val = count_period[idx]\n        a_char = chr(ord('R') + idx % 3)\n        b_char = chr(ord('R') + idx // 3)\n        nike_loss, poly_loss = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        nike_total += full_periods * count_val * nike_loss\n        poly_total += full_periods * count_val * poly_loss\n        \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        nike_loss, poly_loss = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        nike_total += nike_loss\n        poly_total += poly_loss\n        \n    print(f\"{nike_total} {poly_total}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Period Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the period `T` after which the combined sequence repeats.\n3. **Outcome Determination**: For each position within one period `T`, the outcome of the round (whether it's a loss for Nikephoros or Polycarpus) is determined based on the current moves from sequences `A` and `B`.\n4. **Counting Losses**: The counts of losses within one period are stored. These counts are then scaled by the number of full periods (`full_periods`) in `n` rounds. The remaining rounds are processed individually.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity and avoids the need for brute-force simulation, ensuring optimal performance.",
