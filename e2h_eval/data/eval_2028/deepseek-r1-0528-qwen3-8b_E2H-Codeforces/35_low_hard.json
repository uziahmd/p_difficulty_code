Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s which is the binary representation of m (without spaces)\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as:\n        f(x) = sum_{i: bit(i) in x is set} a_i\n\n But note: the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1, and the positions in the binary representation of x (from least significant bit to most?) \n However, note the example: \n      n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary) -> bits at positions 0,1,3 are set (if we consider the least significant bit as position 0, then 11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3)\n      so f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n But the input for m is given as a string of digits (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m. However, note that the problem says:\n      m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0?\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n      \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n And note: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (so the positions are from 0 to n-1, with the i-th bit corresponding to the exponent 2^i).\n\n However, there's a catch: the example input for the second sample is:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          17 0 10 2 1\n          11010\n\n        Here, m = 11010 in binary? But wait, if we consider the string as given, then:\n\n        The string has 5 characters, so n=5. Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n        But the example says m = 20+21+23 = 11? That doesn't match.\n\n Let me read the example again:\n\n        Example input:\n          ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n        Output: \n          ['3', '27']\n\n        First test case: n=2, array [3,8], m given by \"10\" (binary). Then m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n        Then we have to consider x from 0 to 2 (inclusive). \n          x=0: binary 00 -> no bits set -> f(0)=0.\n          x=1: binary 01 -> only bit0 -> f(1)=a0=3.\n          x=2: binary 10 -> only bit1 -> f(2)=a1=8.\n\n        But wait, the maximum is 8, but the example output is 3? \n\n        Actually, wait: the example output says 3. So that doesn't match.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \n          \"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        This example has n=4, so the array has 4 elements. The example does not say what happens for n=2.\n\n        Now, looking at the first sample input: \n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n            Output: 3\n\n        Why is the output 3? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n        And note: the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1. \n\n        In the example, n=2, so the array a has two elements: a0 and a1.\n\n        The binary representation of m is \"10\", which is two bits. \n\n        But note: the problem says the binary representation of m is given as a string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. \n\n        So for n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The input provides the binary representation of \\( m \\) as a string of '0's and '1's. This string is interpreted from left to right as the most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB), but the problem's function \\( f(x) \\) considers bits from LSB to MSB. \n\n2. **Bitwise Analysis**: For each bit position in \\( x \\), if the bit is set, we include the corresponding element from the array \\( a \\) in the sum. The challenge is to determine which bits can be set without exceeding \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: We process each bit from the least significant to the most significant. For each bit, we decide whether setting it to 1 would still keep \\( x \\leq m \\). However, if setting a bit to 1 might require adjusting higher bits, we need to ensure that the remaining bits can form a valid number.\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: When processing a bit, if the current bit in \\( m \\) is 0, we cannot set the corresponding bit in \\( x \\) without potentially violating the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\). If the bit is 1, we can choose to set it or not, but our decision affects the subsequent bits.\n\n5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum is accumulated based on the bits we decide to set, ensuring that the resulting \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\). The key insight is to maximize the sum by prioritizing bits with higher values in the array \\( a \\) while respecting the binary constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n\n    total_bits = len(s)\n    num = int(s, 2)\n\n    base = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        base[i] = 1 << i\n\n    sum_val = 0\n    tight = True\n    for i in range(total_bits):\n        bit_index = total_bits - 1 - i\n        if tight:\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                if a[bit_index] > 0:\n                    sum_val += a[bit_index]\n                    tight = False\n                else:\n                    pass\n            else:\n                if a[bit_index] > 0:\n                    tight = False\n                else:\n                    pass\n        else:\n            if a[bit_index] > 0:\n                sum_val += a[bit_index]\n\n    print(sum_val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Binary Conversion**: The binary string is converted into its integer equivalent to understand the upper bound \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Bit Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit from the least significant to the most significant. For each bit, it checks if the current number being formed is still within the bounds of \\( m \\) (using a `tight` flag).\n\n4. **Decision Making**: \n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1, the algorithm decides whether to include the bit based on the value in \\( a \\). If including the bit leads to a higher sum and does not violate the constraint, it proceeds.\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is 0, the algorithm must not include the bit to stay within bounds, unless it has already broken the tight constraint.\n\n5. **Sum Accumulation**: The sum is built by adding elements from \\( a \\) corresponding to bits set in \\( x \\), ensuring \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints by leveraging bitwise operations and a greedy strategy to maximize the function value while adhering to the problem's requirements.",
