He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, but note that C appends c's and the condition on the number of c's is defined in terms of existing a's and b's).\n 2. The string is built as:\n    - First, A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n    - Then B appends some number of 'b's.\n    - Then C appends some number of 'c's, which must be equal to either the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string after B's appending.\n\n However, note: when C appends the 'c's, the count of 'a' and 'b' that he uses for the condition is the entire string at that time (which includes A's a's and B's b's). But note: after C appends, the entire string has:\n   - count_a = original number of a's (from A)\n   - count_b = original number of b's (from B) [note: no more b's are added by C]\n   - count_c = the number of c's appended by C, which is either count_a or count_b (the ones from the string before appending c's? Actually, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the one after B's appending (so without the c's). Therefore, the condition for the c's is based on the counts of a and b in the string before appending the c's.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let:\n   n_a = count of 'a' in S\n   n_b = count of 'b' in S\n   n_c = count of 'c' in S\n\n But note: the string is built as:\n   Original: some a's (say x) then some b's (say y) then some c's (say z).\n   However, there is a condition on the order: the a's must come first, then b's, then c's.\n\n So we must check the order: \n   The string should not contain any 'b' before an 'a', and any 'c' before an 'a' or 'b'? Actually, the problem states:\n     - A provides a string of 'a's -> so the beginning must be all 'a's until the first non-'a'. Then B appends 'b's, so after the a's we can have some b's. Then C appends 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the string must be in the form: (one or more 'a') then (one or more 'b') then (some 'c').\n\n However, note: the example 'aabc' is given as YES. Let's break down:\n   Example 3: Input \"aabc\"\n      Count: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> the condition is satisfied because the number of c's (1) is equal to the number of b's (1). \n\n But wait, what if the string is not strictly divided? For example, what if we have \"aacbb\"? This would break the order because after the a's we have two c's? No, the example input says the string is built by appending: first a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n Therefore, the string must have:\n   - All the a's at the beginning, then all the b's, then all the c's.\n\n So we can check:\n   Traverse the string and ensure:\n     - Once we see a 'b', we cannot see an 'a' again.\n     - Once we see a 'c', we cannot see an 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n Alternatively, we can split the string into three segments: [all 'a's] [all 'b's] [all 'c's] and check if the entire string is the concatenation of these three.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string is non-empty and has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But note: the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string (after B's appending, so at least one a and one b). However, the example input might not have c's. Also, note that C appends some number of c's, which could be zero? But wait: the problem says \"some number\", which usually means at least one? Actually, the problem says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\", and \"some\" can mean zero or more? However, note: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\" â€” if the number of a's is 0, then we cannot use that (but the problem says at least one a and one b exist). So the string must have at least one a and one b, but the c's could be zero? Actually, let's read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" and \"it is also possible that the number of c equals both\". The word \"some\" can sometimes include zero, but in this context, note: the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a or b. If there are zero c's, then it must be that either the number of a's is 0 or the number of b's is 0, but the problem states that after B's appending there is at least one a and one b. So zero c's would require that 0 equals either n_a or n_b, which is impossible because n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. Therefore, there must be at least one c? Actually, wait: the condition is about the number of c's appended. The problem says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\" (at that time, which is the string without the appended c's). So the condition for the c's is independent of the c's being present. But note: the string we have is the final string. The condition for the c's is that the count of c's must be either n_a (the a's that were originally there) or n_b (the b's that were originally there). Since n_a and n_b are at least 1, then the count of c's must be either n_a or n_b (both at least 1). So the string must have at least one c.\n\n Therefore, the conditions we have:\n\n Condition 1: The string must be divided into three contiguous parts: [a's], [b's], [c's] (each part at least one character for the a's and b's, but the c's can be zero? Actually, we just deduced that the c's must be at least one because they must equal n_a or n_b, which are positive).\n\n But wait, what if the string does not have any c's? Then the condition fails because the number of c's (0) must equal n_a or n_b, but n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, so 0 != n_a and 0 != n_b. Therefore, the string must have at least one c.\n\n So steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: the string must be such that:\n    - It starts with zero or more 'a's, then\n    - Then one or more 'b's, then\n    - Then one or more 'c's.\n\n    And note: the entire string must be exactly this.\n\n 2. Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string\n    n_b = count of 'b'\n    n_c = count of 'c'\n\n 3. The condition for the c's is: n_c must be equal to either n_a or n_b.\n\n However, note: the counts n_a, n_b, n_c are taken from the entire string. But the problem states that the c's appended are equal to the number of a's (which is the original n_a) or the number of b's (which is the original n_b). Since the string is built by appending, the a's and b's counts remain the same. So we can use the entire string's a and b counts.\n\n But note: the entire string's a count is the same as the original because no a's are added after, and similarly for b's (no b's are added). So we can use the entire string's counts.\n\n However, there is a catch: the order condition must hold.\n\n Therefore, algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Check the order of the string.\n\n   We can traverse the string and check:\n\n   Let i = 0\n   While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n   Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n   Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n   If we have traversed the entire string (i == len(S)) and we had at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c', then proceed.\n\n   But note: the problem says that after B's appending there is at least one a and one b, and then C appends some c's (at least one). So the entire string must have at least one of each.\n\n   However, what if the string does not have a 'b'? Then the condition fails. Similarly, if the string doesn't have a 'c', then condition fails.\n\n Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c' in the entire string.\n\n   Then, check if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n But wait: what if the string does not follow the order? Then we must output NO.\n\n However, note: there is an example: 'bbacc' -> NO.\n\n Why? Because the order is broken? Actually, the example input 'bbacc' is given as NO.\n\n Let's break down 'bbacc':\n\n   This string starts with 'b', so it breaks the condition that the beginning must be all a's. Therefore, the order condition fails.\n\n Therefore, the complete solution:\n\n   Read S.\n\n   Step 1: Check the order.\n\n        Let i = 0\n        # Read all a's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all b's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all c's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        If i != len(S): then there is an invalid character or wrong order -> NO.\n\n   Step 2: Now, we know the string is composed of a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n        But we must also ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. However, the problem states that the process requires at least one a and one b (from A and B) and then C appends at least one c (because the condition requires n_c to be at least one). But note: the condition for the c's is that n_c must be either n_a or n_b, which are at least one, so we don't need to explicitly check for the presence of a and b? Actually, the problem says at least one a and one b, so we must have n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. And we also must have n_c>=1 (because n_c must be one of n_a or n_b, which are >=1). \n\n        However, the order condition above does not check for the existence of at least one a and one b. We must check that we have at least one a and one b and one c.\n\n        Alternatively, during the order checking, we can check that we have at least one a (i.e., the first loop ran at least once) and at least one b (the second loop ran at least once) and then the third loop (for c) must run at least once because n_c>=1.\n\n        But note: the problem says that after B's appending there is at least one a and one b. So the string must have at least one a and one b. However, if the string is \"aaa\", then we don't have any b's. But our order checking would stop at the first non-a and then move to the next condition. In \"aaa\", the first loop runs and then we try to read b's: but there are none, so the second loop doesn't run. Then we try to read c's: none. Then i remains at len(S) (if we started with all a's and then nothing else) but wait, the order condition would say that after a's we cannot have a non-a? Actually, the condition of the problem requires that B appends some b's (so at least one b). Therefore, the string must have at least one b.\n\n        Similarly, the entire string must have at least one c because C appends at least one c (since the condition requires n_c to be the number of a's or b's, which is at least one).\n\n        So the order condition must be:\n\n          The string is split into three contiguous parts, and the second part (b's) must be non-empty, and the third part (c's) must be non-empty. The first part (a's) must be non-empty (because the problem says A provides a string of a's, and then B appends b's, so there's at least one a). \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'\", meaning at least one? Actually, \"some number\" could be zero? But then the problem says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\". So the entire string after B's appending must have at least one a and one b. Therefore, the a's part must be non-empty (because the a's are provided by A) and the b's part must be non-empty (provided by B). \n\n        So we must have:\n\n          - The first segment (a's) must be non-empty.\n          - The second segment (b's) must be non-empty.\n          - The third segment (c's) must be non-empty.\n\n        And then the condition: n_c must be equal to either the total n_a (which is the entire string's a count, same as the first segment) or the total n_b (entire string's b count, same as the second segment).\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        After the order check, we can check:\n\n        if the first segment length > 0 and the second segment length > 0 and the third segment length > 0, then proceed.\n\n        But note: the order check above does not record the lengths. We can modify the order check to count the numbers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let a_count = 0\n        for char in S:\n            if char == 'a':\n                a_count += 1\n            elif char == 'b':\n                break\n        Then, the rest: from the point after the last 'a' until the last 'b' (if we break at the first non-'a')? Actually, we broke the loop at the first non-'a'. But we want to check the entire string.\n\n   Better: \n\n        Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string? Actually, the entire string's a's are all at the beginning, so we can count the a's until we hit a non-'a'.\n\n        Similarly, n_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (which should be the consecutive b's after the a's).\n\n        But note: the entire string's a's are the same as the a's at the beginning, so we can just count the a's from the start until the first non-'a'.\n\n        Similarly for b's: from the point after the last consecutive 'a' until the next non-'b'.\n\n        However, we can simply count the entire string for a, b, c, because the order condition ensures that all a's are at the beginning, all b's next, and then all c's.\n\n        So:\n\n        total_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (but we know they are contiguous at the beginning)\n        total_b = count of 'b' in the entire string\n        total_c = count of 'c' in the entire string\n\n        But we must ensure that the order is correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Check the order and count the a's, b's, and c's.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        s = given string\n\n        # Check order and count\n        i = 0\n        n_a = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n            n_a += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        n_b = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n            n_b += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        n_c = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n            n_c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != len(s) or n_a==0 or n_b==0 or n_c==0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        Then, check if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that C appends the c's, so the entire string's a's and b's are the same as the original (from A and B). And the condition for the c's is that the number of c's (n_c) must be equal to the number of a's (n_a) or the number of b's (n_b) in the string (which is the entire string without the c's? Actually, wait: the condition is \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string at that time (when C appends) is the string without the c's. But note, the entire string without the c's has:\n\n            a_count = n_a (same as now, because no a's are removed)\n            b_count = n_b (same)\n\n        So the condition is n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n        However, note: the entire string has n_a + n_b + n_c, and the condition is based on the counts of a and b in the string that existed before appending the c's. That string was of length (n_a + n_b) and contained n_a a's and n_b b's. So the condition is indeed n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"ab\"? Then we have n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=0. Then we already rejected because n_c must be positive (we checked n_c>0). So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the above code counts the entire string's a, b, and c. But the order condition we checked ensures that the a's are all at the beginning, then b's, then c's.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"aaabccc\"\n\n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 (n_c==n_a) -> YES.\n\n        Input: \"bbacc\"\n\n        Let's break down \"bbacc\":\n            Start: first char is 'b', so the while loop for a's doesn't run -> n_a=0 -> then we break and check: n_a==0 -> so we output NO.\n\n        Input: \"aabc\"\n\n        Breakdown: \n            First while: reads 'a','a' -> n_a=2, then i=2\n            Second while: reads 'b' -> n_b=1, then i=3\n            Third while: reads 'c' -> n_c=1, then i=4 -> done.\n\n            Condition: n_c (1) == n_a (2)? no. n_c (1) == n_b (1)? yes -> YES.\n\n   However, what if the string has a different order? For example, \"acb\": \n\n        First while: reads 'a', then i=1 -> then the next char is 'c', so the second while for b's doesn't run (n_b=0) -> then we check and find n_b==0 -> NO.\n\n   Another example: \"aabbcc\"\n\n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 (either n_a or n_b) -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aabbbc\" (here, n_c=1, n_a=2, n_b=3 -> condition: 1==2? no, 1==3? no -> NO)\n\n   Example: \"aaabbbccc\" (n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==3 -> YES)\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES)\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=4 -> condition: 4==4 -> YES)\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" with n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   But note: the condition is that the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. So 3 is equal to the number of b's (3) so YES.\n\n   However, what if the string has two segments of a's and b's? For example, \"aabbaabbcc\" â€” but wait, the order condition requires that after a's we have only b's and then c's. In \"aabbaabbcc\", we have:\n\n        First: 'a','a' -> then two 'b's, then two 'a's? -> no, that would break the order. Actually, the string \"aabbaabbcc\" has an 'a' after the first set of b's, so the order condition fails.\n\n   Therefore, the order condition is strict.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that the entire string must have only one contiguous block of a's and then one contiguous block of b's and then one contiguous block of c's. But the process implies that: A gives a string of a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's.\n\n   So the entire string must be in the form: a* b* c*\n\n   We can also check the order by:\n\n        if any character other than 'a' appears before the first 'b' or 'c', that's okay? Actually, we break the string into three parts.\n\n   We have already done the three while loops.\n\n   But note: the problem allows that the string might have only a's and then only b's and then only c's, and the entire string is built that way.\n\n   One more edge: empty string? The problem says |S|>=1.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        n_a = 0\n        n_b = 0\n        n_c = 0\n\n        i = 0\n        # Count consecutive 'a'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n            n_a += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        # Count consecutive 'b'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n            n_b += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        # Count consecutive 'c'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n            n_c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        # If we didn't traverse the whole string, or any of the counts is zero, then invalid.\n        if i != len(s) or n_a==0 or n_b==0 or n_c==0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, consider the possibility that the string might have more than three segments? Our while loops break at the first non-'a', then non-'b', then non-'c'. But if the string is \"aabbcc\", that works.\n\n   But what if the string is \"abac\"? \n        First while: reads one 'a' -> n_a=1, then i=1.\n        Second while: reads 'b' -> n_b=1, then i=2.\n        Third while: reads 'a' -> but we break because 'a' is not 'c'. Then i=2, and we haven't traversed the entire string (i=2 < 5) -> so we output NO.\n\n   But note: the string \"abac\" is invalid because after the b's there is an 'a', which is not allowed.\n\n   This matches our condition.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aabbccc\" and the condition is that the number of c's is 3, and n_a=2, n_b=2 -> then 3 is neither 2 nor 2 -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"aabbccc\" -> n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=3 -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"aabbcc\" -> n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=4 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" with n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (n_c=4, n_a=4) -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (n_c=3, n_b=3) -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" (n_c=2, n_a=4, n_b=3) -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbccc\" (n_a=4, n_b=2, n_c=3) -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n   But wait: the condition says the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In \"aaaabbccc\", the number of a's is 4, the number of b's is 2, the number of c's is 3. 3 is not 4 and not 2 -> NO.\n\n   This seems correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the c's is defined on the string before appending the c's. The string before appending the c's is \"aaaabb\", which has 4 a's and 2 b's. Then C appends 3 c's. But the condition requires that the number of c's (3) is either 4 (number of a's) or 2 (number of b's). 3 is neither. So it is NO.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with the examples provided:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            a's: 3, b's: 1, c's: 3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            First character is 'b', so the first while loop doesn't run -> n_a=0 -> NO.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            a's: 2, b's: 1, c's: 1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   But wait, the example input says:\n\n        Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        Expected Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n   So the code produces the expected.\n\n   However, note: the example input may have multiple strings? Actually, the problem says the first and only line consists of a string S.\n\n   So we are reading one string.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list for demonstration. We are reading one string per run.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        # ... the rest of the code ...\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string length is between 1 and 5000, so we are safe with the while loops.\n\n   Let me run one more edge: \"abc\" -> \n        a:1, b:1, c:1 -> condition: 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's. In this case, the string \"abc\" has one a, one b, and one c. The condition is satisfied.\n\n   But note: the order is correct.\n\n   Another edge: \"ac\" -> \n        First while: a -> n_a=1, then i=1.\n        Then, the next character is 'c', so the second while for b's doesn't run (n_b=0) -> then we check and n_b==0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"ab\" -> \n        n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aab\" -> \n        n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabb\" -> \n        n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"a\" -> \n        Then we have n_b=0 or n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"b\" -> \n        n_a=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"c\" -> \n        n_a=0 and n_b=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabbb\" -> \n        n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabbbccc\" -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabbbcccc\" -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=4 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabbbccccc\" -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=5 -> NO.\n\n   Another edge: \"aabbbcccccc\" (6 c's) -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=6 -> 6==2? no, 6==3? no -> NO.\n\n   But wait: 6 is not 2 or 3, so NO.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aabbbcccccc\" (with 6 c's) but the condition is that the number of c's must be either the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (3). 6 is neither. So NO.\n\n   But note: the condition is defined on the string before appending the c's. The string before appending the c's is \"aabbb\", which has 2 a's and 3 b's. Then C appends 6 c's, but 6 is not 2 and not 3 -> NO.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, consider: what if the string is \"aaaabbbbcccc\" (each letter 4 times). Then n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4 -> YES.\n\n   But wait: the condition says the number of c's must be the number of a's OR the number of b's. Since 4==4, YES.\n\n   But note: the condition does not say that the entire string must have the same counts. It just requires that the appended c's count is either the original a count or the original b count.\n\n   The original a count is 4, the original b count is 4, and the appended c's are 4, so 4==4.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n_a = 0\n        n_b = 0\n        n_c = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n            n_a += 1\n            i += 1\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n            n_b += 1\n            i += 1\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n            n_c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != len(s) or n_a == 0 or n_b == 0 or n_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: the condition says that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement). We are already checking that n_a>0, n_b>0, n_c>0 (via the condition that none is zero). So that's covered.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that after B's appending there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. We are checking that with n_a>0 and n_b>0 (and n_c>0). So that's correct.\n\n   But note: the condition for the c's is independent of the order. We are checking the order first. \n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string must have only one contiguous block of a's and then one contiguous block of b's and then one contiguous block of c's? Actually, the process forces that: A gives a string of a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the entire string is the concatenation of a string of a's, then a string of b's, then a string of c's.\n\n   Our while loops are counting the contiguous a's, then contiguous b's, then contiguous c's.\n\n   But what if there are non-contiguous a's? For example, \"aba\" â€” that is not allowed. Our while loops will:\n\n        First while: read the first 'a', then i=1. Then the next char is 'b', so the second while reads the 'b', then i=2. Then the next char is 'a', so the third while (for c) doesn't run, and we break. Then i=2, which is less than 3 -> so we output NO.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Final code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string consists of only 'a','b','c'. So we don't have to worry about other characters.\n\n   Let's submit.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"a\" (length 1)? Then we break the condition because n_b and n_c are zero. We output NO.\n\n   Similarly, \"b\" -> NO, \"c\"-> NO.\n\n   What if the string is \"aab\"? Then n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   What if the string is \"aabb\"? Then n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n   What if the string is \"aabbcc\"? Then YES.\n\n   Everything seems to be covered.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that C appends some number of c's, so the entire string must have at least one c. We are checking n_c>0, so that's correct.\n\n   One more: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n   But wait, the example input says \"aabc\" is YES, which we have.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            First char is 'b', so n_a=0 -> NO.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> YES.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        YES\n        NO\n        YES\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading one string.\n\n   So for each test case, we read one string.\n\n   We assume the input format is as described.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n_a = 0\n        n_b = 0\n        n_c = 0\n        i = 0\n        # Count consecutive 'a'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n            n_a += 1\n            i += 1\n        # Count consecutive 'b'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'b':\n            n_b += 1\n            i += 1\n        # Count consecutive 'c'\n        while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'c':\n            n_c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != len(s) or n_a == 0 or n_b == 0 or n_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends some 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order means the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's (n_a), 'b's (n_b), and 'c's (n_c) in the entire string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Then, check if the number of 'c's (n_c) is equal to either the number of 'a's (n_a) or the number of 'b's (n_b). If both conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n_a = 0\n    n_b = 0\n    n_c = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n        n_a += 1\n        i += 1\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'b':\n        n_b += 1\n        i += 1\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'c':\n        n_c += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != len(s) or n_a == 0 or n_b == 0 or n_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Character Counting**: The code counts consecutive 'a's, followed by consecutive 'b's, and then consecutive 'c's. This ensures the string adheres to the required order (all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's).\n3. **Validation Checks**: The code checks if the entire string was processed (no invalid characters) and that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n4. **Condition Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid. The result is printed as \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on this check.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's structure and character counts to determine if it meets the specified conditions.",
