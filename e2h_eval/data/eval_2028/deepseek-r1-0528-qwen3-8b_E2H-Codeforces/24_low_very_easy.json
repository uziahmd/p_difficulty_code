She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open.\n\n There are a few cases:\n\n 1. If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment (i.e., l == 1 and r == n, or more precisely if the current set of tabs includes only [l, r]), then we don't need to do anything. But note: the problem says we have to leave only [l, r]. So if initially the set is [1, n] and [l, r] is a subset, but if we have already closed some tabs? Actually, the problem states: \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\". So we start with all n tabs, and we want to close all others.\n\n However, note that the example: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0. This means that we don't have to close any tabs because the desired segment [1,5] is the entire set.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   - Closing the tabs to the left of l (if any)\n   - Closing the tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\n But note: the cursor starts at `pos`. We can move the cursor and then use the close operations.\n\n Operations available:\n   - Move left/right: one step at a time, but the movement boundaries change as we close tabs.\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (this will set the left boundary to the cursor's current tab, so effectively removing everything left of the cursor)\n   - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor (similarly)\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the boundaries for movement change.\n\n Important: We are allowed to close in any order and we can move the cursor arbitrarily (within the current boundaries) until we reach the desired position to close.\n\n Let's define:\n   left_side = the part [1, l-1] that we need to close.\n   right_side = the part [r+1, n] that we need to close.\n\n We might need to close both sides, or one side, or none.\n\n How do we think?\n\n Option 1: If we are already within [l, r] and there's nothing to close on the left and right, then 0.\n\n But note: even if we have [l, r] as the entire set, then we don't need to do anything.\n\n However, what if the current set is not [l, r]? We start with [1, n] and we want [l, r].\n\n The problem can be solved by considering:\n\n  Case 1: No closing needed (if l == 1 and r == n) -> 0.\n\n  Otherwise, we have to close either the left part, the right part, or both.\n\n  But note: we can also close from the inside. The key is that when we close one side, the boundaries change and we might then be able to close the other side without moving the cursor too much.\n\n  Actually, the problem can be broken down:\n\n  We must close the left part (if exists) and the right part (if exists). However, we can choose the order.\n\n  Let's denote:\n    left_work = whether we need to close the left part (i.e., l > 1)\n    right_work = whether we need to close the right part (i.e., r < n)\n\n  Now, the strategy:\n\n  We can do:\n\n    Option A: \n      - First, move the cursor to l (if necessary) and then close the left side (which will remove everything left of l). Then, move to r and close the right side.\n\n    Option B:\n      - First, move the cursor to r (if necessary) and then close the right side, then move to l and close the left side.\n\n  But note: we can also close without moving the cursor if we are already at the correct position for one of the sides.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n    Let A = number of seconds to close the left part (if needed) and B = number of seconds to close the right part (if needed). However, the movement to the cursor positions matters.\n\n  Steps for closing the left part:\n    - To close the left part, we must have the cursor at least at l (because we can only close the left of the cursor). Then, we can close the left part (one operation). Similarly, for the right part, we must have the cursor at most at r (then one operation).\n\n  However, note that we can do the two operations in any order, and we can use the fact that after closing one side, the other side might become easier (or the boundaries change so that we don't have to move as far).\n\n  Actually, the problem is symmetric. We can consider:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and determining the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to achieve the desired result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba starts with all `n` tabs open, and the cursor is at position `pos`.\n   - She needs to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n   - Operations allowed: move cursor left/right (within current tab boundaries), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, we need to close tabs either to the left of `l` or to the right of `r`, or both.\n   - The optimal strategy involves moving the cursor to the necessary positions (either `l` or `r`) and then performing the close operations. The order of operations (closing left first or right first) depends on the initial cursor position relative to `l` and `r`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: If no tabs need to be closed (`l == 1` and `r == n`), output `0`.\n   - **Case 2**: If only one side needs closing (either left or right), calculate the time based on whether the cursor is already within the segment or needs to be moved.\n   - **Case 3**: If both sides need closing, consider the minimal steps required to move the cursor to both `l` and `r` and perform the close operations, choosing the most efficient path.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_work = l > 1\n    right_work = r < n\n    \n    if not left_work and not right_work:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_work and not right_work:\n        moves_needed = abs(pos - l)\n        print(moves_needed + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if right_work and not left_work:\n        moves_needed = abs(pos - r)\n        print(moves_needed + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if left_work and right_work:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Case 1**: If the desired segment `[l, r]` covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed, so the answer is `0`.\n- **Case 2**: If only the left side needs closing (`l > 1` but `r == n`), the cursor must move to `l` (requiring `abs(pos - l)` moves) and then one close operation. The total time is `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n- **Case 3**: Similarly, if only the right side needs closing (`r < n` but `l == 1`), the cursor moves to `r` (requiring `abs(pos - r)` moves) and one close operation, totaling `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n- **Case 4**: If both sides need closing, we consider two options:\n  - Move to `l`, close left tabs, then move to `r`, and close right tabs.\n  - Move to `r`, close right tabs, then move to `l`, and close left tabs.\n  The minimal time between these two options is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible scenarios by breaking down the problem into manageable cases and selecting the optimal path based on the initial cursor position and the target segment.",
