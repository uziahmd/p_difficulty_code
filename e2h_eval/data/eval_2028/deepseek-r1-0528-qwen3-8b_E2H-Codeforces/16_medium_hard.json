Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border (of nonzero length). \n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing one or more roads. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n We start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (but note: moving from one block to another requires crossing a contiguous segment of a road, i.e., a full crossing of one road? Actually, the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a common edge (which is part of one road). \n\n But note: two blocks are separated by one or more roads. To go from one block to another, we must cross at least one road. However, if we cross multiple roads at an intersection, we might be able to do it in one step? Let me clarify:\n\n The problem states: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is a segment of a road. So if two blocks share a common segment of a road (meaning they are separated by exactly one road along that segment) then they are adjacent and we can cross in one step.\n\n However, if two blocks are separated by two different roads, then they don't share a common border (because the border between them would be two distinct segments from two different roads, so no single contiguous border). Therefore, to go from one block to another, we can only cross one road at a time.\n\n But wait: what if we cross two roads at an intersection? Then we are actually crossing two roads at once. However, the problem says that the step requires a nonzero common border. The common border is the set of points that are the boundary. When two blocks meet at an intersection, they don't share a nonzero-length border; they only share a point. So we cannot cross two roads at once.\n\n Therefore, each step must cross exactly one road.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to cross the roads in any particular order. We need to determine the minimum number of steps (road crossings) to get from home to university.\n\n But wait: is the answer simply the number of roads that separate home and university? Not exactly. Because sometimes we might cross a road twice? Actually, we are allowed to cross the same road multiple times? But note: the problem says the roads divide the plane and we are moving from one block to another. Once we cross a road, we are in a new block and we don't have to cross it again to return (unless we go back). However, the minimal path should not require crossing the same road twice.\n\n However, here's the catch: the minimal number of steps is actually the number of roads that we must cross to get from home to university. But note: if we cross a road, we change the side. We can think of each road as having two sides. The home and university are on some sides of the roads. For each road, we can check which side the home and university are on. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road at least once. If they are on the same side, then we do not need to cross.\n\n But is that sufficient? Consider: the roads are linear and the plane is divided. The minimal number of road crossings is the number of roads that separate home and university. However, note that we can cross one road at a time, and we are allowed to cross only one road per step.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\n However, wait: consider the example inputs.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n   The home (1,1) is above the x-axis and right of the y-axis.\n   The university (-1,-1) is below the x-axis and left of the y-axis.\n\n   How many roads separate them?\n        Road1: (1,1) -> 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 >0, (-1,-1) -> 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> opposite sides.\n        Road2: (1,1) -> 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 >0, (-1,-1) -> 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> opposite sides.\n\n   So according to this, we need to cross both roads. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads:\n        Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n        Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        Road3: 1*x + 1*y -3 = 0 -> x+y=3\n\n   Check Road1: (1,1): 1>0, (-1,-1): -1<0 -> opposite.\n   Check Road2: (1,1): 1>0, (-1,-1): -1<0 -> opposite.\n   Check Road3: (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0, (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 <0 -> same side.\n\n   Therefore, we need to cross the first two roads. So the answer is 2.\n\n But wait: what if the separation by multiple roads is such that we can cross two roads at an intersection? Actually, note that the problem does not allow crossing two roads at the same step (since the common border must be nonzero, and an intersection is just a point). So each step is one road.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes the minimal path might require crossing a road that doesn't separate the two points? No, because if a road does not separate the two points, then we don't need to cross it.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: is that always true?\n\n Consider: the roads are lines, and the arrangement is such that the home and university are in two regions. The minimal number of roads to cross is the number of roads that have the two points on opposite sides.\n\n Why? Because if a road has the two points on the same side, then we don't need to cross it. Otherwise, we do.\n\n However, note: when we cross a road, we change the side for that road. But the entire journey must change the side for every road that separates the two.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: consider the following scenario with three roads that form a triangle. The home and university are in two regions. The two regions might be separated by two roads, but the direct path might require crossing two roads. And indeed, we count two.\n\n However, there is a known example: the problem statement examples.\n\n But wait: what if the roads are not axis-aligned and the two points are separated by two roads, but the two roads are parallel? Then the minimal path must cross both, so two steps.\n\n So the algorithm is:\n\n   For each road (a, b, c):\n        Compute the value for home: f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Compute the value for university: f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        Note: the sign of the equation: the line is defined as a*i + b*j + c = 0.\n        But the side is determined by the sign of the expression.\n\n        However, note: the definition of the side does not depend on the normalization. Two points on the same side will have the same sign (if we define the expression without normalization) and opposite signs for opposite sides.\n\n        But caution: the expression can be multiplied by -1 and the line equation remains the same. However, we are consistent: we use the same equation for both points.\n\n        So if (f1 * f2 < 0) then the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Then the answer is the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Road1: (0,1,0): \n        f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        product = -1 <0 -> opposite.\n\n   Road2: (1,0,0):\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        product = -1 <0 -> opposite.\n\n   Count = 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Road1: (1,0,0): \n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n   Road2: (0,1,0):\n        f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n   Road3: (1,1,-3):\n        f1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5\n        product = (-1)*(-5)=5 >0 -> same side.\n\n   Count = 2.\n\n Therefore, output 2.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says that the answer is the minimum number of steps. And according to our reasoning, each step crosses one road. And we need to cross every separating road. And we cannot avoid crossing a separating road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the home and university are located in some blocks, and we can only move through the blocks. The arrangement of the roads may force us to cross the same road multiple times? \n\n But observe: if a road separates the two points, then we must cross it at least once. However, if we cross it more than once, that would be inefficient. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is indeed the number of separating roads.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by two roads, but the two roads are not independent? For example, if the two roads are the same? The input guarantees that no two roads are the same.\n\n Another consideration: what if the two points are separated by two roads, but the two roads are parallel? Then we must cross both, and we cannot cross both at the same time (since they are parallel, they never intersect). So two steps.\n\n What if the two roads are not parallel and they intersect? Then we can cross them independently. So two steps.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, let me look at the constraints: n up to 300, and coordinates up to 10^6. We are doing 300 checks, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: there is a known pitfall. The equation of the line is a*i + b*j + c = 0. The sign of the expression tells which side the point is on. However, note: if the line is defined with negative coefficients, the sign still holds. But what if the line is degenerate? The problem states: |ai|+|bi|>0.\n\n However, one more thing: the expression f1 = a*x1+b*y1+c and f2 = a*x2+b*y2+c. The product being negative means opposite sides. But if one of the expressions is zero? The problem states that neither home nor university lies on the road. Therefore, we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count++\n\n   Print count\n\n Let me test with a simple example of one road.\n\n Example: \n   Home: (0,0), University: (0,1)\n   Road: x=0 (i.e., 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0)\n\n   f1 = 1*0 + 0*0 + 0 = 0 -> but wait, the problem says the home is not on the road. So we are guaranteed that the home and university are not on the road.\n\n   Therefore, we don't have to handle zeros.\n\n However, what if the expression overflows? The coordinates and coefficients can be up to 10^6. Then:\n\n   a*x1 can be as large as 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and similarly for others. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow. But we are multiplying two integers that can be up to 1e12, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the roads are given with coefficients in [-10^6, 10^6] and the coordinates are in [-10^6,10^6]. So the maximum absolute value of the expression is:\n\n   |a*x1 + b*y1 + c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c| <= 10^6*10^6 + 10^6*10^6 + 10^6 = 10^12 + 10^12 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. The product of two such numbers can be up to 4e24, which is still within Python's integer range (since Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the operations might be slower for very large numbers). However, 4e24 is acceptable in terms of representation, but we are only doing 300 multiplications and comparisons.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the multiplication by comparing the signs: if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0). But that is equivalent to f1 * f2 < 0.\n\n However, if we are concerned about the product being too large (for example, in C++ we might use long long and worry about overflow) but in Python we don't have to. But note: the product might be negative, and we are only interested in the sign. We can do:\n\n   if (f1 < 0) != (f2 < 0):\n\n This avoids the huge product.\n\n Let me rewrite:\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Calculate the two values\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Check if they have opposite signs\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 >= 0) or (val1 >= 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n But wait: the problem states that the points are not on the road, so we don't have zeros. Therefore, we can use strict inequalities.\n\n However, the condition (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) is the same as (val1 * val2 < 0) and also the same as (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0).\n\n But note: if one of the values is zero, then we have a problem. But the problem says the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n\n So we can use either.\n\n However, the product might be a very big negative or positive, but we are using integers and Python can handle it. But the alternative comparison is safe.\n\n Since the problem constraints are high, but the number of roads is small (n<=300), we can use the product method. But if we are worried about overflow in other languages, we use the sign comparison.\n\n But in Python, we can use:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n\n This is safe and efficient.\n\n Let me test:\n\n   val1 = 5, val2 = -3 -> (5<0) is False, (-3<0) is True -> False != True -> True.\n   val1 = -5, val2 = 3 -> (-5<0) is True, (3<0) is False -> True != False -> True.\n\n   val1 = 5, val2 = 3 -> False != False -> False.\n   val1 = -5, val2 = -3 -> True != True -> False.\n\n Perfect.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        # Since the points are not on the road, we know val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined with a negative constant? The sign of the expression depends on the equation. However, the condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) is independent of the magnitude and only depends on the side. And the equation defines two sides: one where the expression is positive and one negative. The problem does not specify the direction of the normal vector, so the sign is arbitrary. But note: the condition for opposite sides is that the two points yield expressions of opposite signs, regardless of the equation's normalization.\n\n This method is correct.\n\n However, wait: the example input format: the third line is an integer n, then n lines each with three integers.\n\n Example input:\n\n   \"1 1\"\n   \"-1 -1\"\n   \"2\"\n   \"0 1 0\"\n   \"1 0 0\"\n\n Our code:\n\n   x1, y1 = 1, 1\n   x2, y2 = -1, -1\n   n = 2\n\n   Then for the first road: [0,1,0]\n        val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative\n        Condition: (1<0) is False, (-1<0) is True -> True, so count becomes 1.\n\n   Second road: [1,0,0]\n        val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative\n        Condition: True, so count becomes 2.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait: the problem says the answer for the first example is 2.\n\n However, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output 2.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output 2.\n\n So we are good.\n\n But wait: there is a known issue with the product method: if the product is very large, but in Python we don't care. However, the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates are up to 10^6, so the product is up to 10^12 * 2 (from two terms) plus the other term, so around 2e12, and then we multiply two such numbers to get up to 4e24. That is acceptable in Python.\n\n But the sign comparison method avoids the huge product. However, in Python, the integers are arbitrary precision, so both methods are acceptable.\n\n However, let me check: the example input format. The input is given as:\n\n   First line: two integers (x1, y1)\n   Second line: two integers (x2, y2)\n   Third line: integer n\n   Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n But wait, the example input string is given as:\n\n   ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...]\n\n So we read from stdin.\n\n Let me write the complete code.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example inputs are given as strings. But in the actual program, we read from stdin.\n\n We'll use:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().strip().splitlines()\n\n But the problem says: \"Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\"\n\n We can simply use:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # compute ...\n\n But wait, what if there are extra spaces? The input is space-separated integers.\n\n Since the problem says the input format, we assume well-formatted.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n But wait, there's a third example in the problem statement? Actually, the example input is provided as two separate strings. The problem says:\n\n   ### Input\n   ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   ### Output\n   ['2', '2']\n\n So the two examples.\n\n However, note: the second example input has 3 roads, and the third road is \"1 1 -3\", which we already handled.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is defined differently? For example, if the equation is given as a*i + b*j + c = 0, and we have a negative a? \n\n Example: \n        Road: -x = 0  -> a=-1, b=0, c=0.\n        For home (1,1): -1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = -1 -> negative.\n        For university (-1,-1): -1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n\n        Then (val1 < 0) is True, (val2 < 0) is False -> opposite, so we count.\n\n        This is the same as the road x=0 (which would be a=1, b=0, c=0): \n            (1,1): 1 -> positive, (-1,-1): -1 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n        So the sign of the equation does not matter because we are only checking the relative signs.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if the line equation is normalized differently? For example, if we multiply the entire equation by a negative factor, then the signs flip. But the condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) still holds because both val1 and val2 would flip, so the inequality remains.\n\n Example: \n        Original equation: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0.\n        Multiply by -1: a=-1, b=0, c=0.\n\n        Then for (1,1): original was 1, now becomes -1 -> negative.\n        For (-1,-1): original was -1, now becomes 1 -> positive.\n\n        Condition: (-1<0) != (1<0) -> True != False -> True.\n\n        Same result.\n\n Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n But wait: there is an alternative interpretation. Some problems define the side by the normal vector pointing to one side. However, our method is purely algebraic and only uses the sign of the expression.\n\n Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, we know val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me submit.\n\n But wait: I just thought of an edge case. What if the road equation is given as, for example, 2x + 3y + 4 = 0? Then the expression is 2x+3y+4. The sign is still defined.\n\n Example: \n        Home (0,0): 4 -> positive.\n        University (0,-1): 2*0 + 3*(-1)+4 = 1 -> positive -> same side.\n\n        Correct.\n\n Another example: \n        Road: 2x+3y+4=0, Home (0,0): 4, University (0,-2): 2*0+3*(-2)+4 = -6+4 = -2 -> negative.\n\n        Then (4<0) is False, (-2<0) is True -> opposite.\n\n        Correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the roads are defined by aix + biy + ci = 0, and the expression is the same as the left-hand side.\n\n However, note: the expression we compute is the left-hand side. The side is defined by the sign of the expression.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which side is which, but the condition for opposite sides is independent.\n\n Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement example input and output are provided, and we have tested with two examples.\n\n But note: the problem says that the roads divide the plane, and we are to count the minimal steps. And we argued that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, there is a known concept in arrangements: the minimal number of roads to cross is the same as the number of roads that separate the two points (each road that separates must be crossed at least once, and we can cross one road per step, and there is a path that crosses exactly those roads).\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are such that they are not crossed in a straight line? Actually, we are not constrained by the route, we can choose any path. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads to cross, and that is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the path to be straight. We can cross the roads in any order, but we must cross each separating road at least once.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But wait: consider the following configuration: three roads forming a triangle. Suppose the home and university are separated by two roads. Then we must cross two roads, but note: the two roads might be adjacent and we can cross them in two consecutive steps. But the problem does not require consecutive steps to be along the same line, so two steps.\n\n However, there is a known planar graph duality: the minimal number of roads to cross is the same as the minimal number of edges to traverse in the dual graph? Actually, the dual graph of the arrangement has vertices at intersections and edges along the roads. The regions are the faces. The minimal steps (edges in the dual) to go from home to university is the number of roads (edges) we cross. And the number of edges we cross is the number of separating roads.\n\n Therefore, we are confident.\n\n However, wait: there is a counterexample? \n\n Consider: two roads that are the same? But the problem states: no two roads are the same.\n\n Consider: two roads that are parallel and separate the two points. Then we must cross both, so two steps.\n\n Consider: two roads that are not parallel. Then they intersect. We must cross both, so two steps.\n\n Now, what if the two points are separated by three roads? Then we must cross three roads, so three steps.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n However, wait: what if the two points are separated by a road and then by the same road again? Actually, the arrangement is such that once you cross a road, you are on the other side. The two points are either separated by a road or not. There is no \"multiple separations\" by the same road.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the home and university are located in some blocks. The entire plane is divided by the roads. The minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, there is a known fact: in an arrangement of lines, the minimal number of lines to separate two points is the number of lines that have the two points on opposite sides.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This is equivalent to crossing one road (because the common border is a segment of one road). Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n And we must cross every separating road. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n Thus, the code is correct.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), roads: x=0 and y=0 -> both roads separate, so 2.\n\n Example 2: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), roads: x=0, y=0, and x+y=3. \n        For x+y=3: \n            (1,1): 1+1=2 <3 -> the expression is 1*x+1*y-3 -> 2-3=-1 -> negative.\n            (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 -> negative -> same side.\n\n        So only two roads separate, so 2.\n\n Therefore, we output 2.\n\n However, wait: the example input for the second example is:\n\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n        The third road: 1 1 -3 -> equation: x+y-3=0.\n\n        Now, the home (1,1) is above the line? Actually, the line x+y=3. The point (1,1) is below the line (since 1+1=2<3). The university (-1,-1) is also below the line (since -1+-1=-2<3). So they are on the same side.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n So the code produces the correct outputs.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says:\n\n        Example 1: Output 2\n        Example 2: Output 2\n\n However, note: the problem statement example input is given as:\n\n        Example 1: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output 2\n        Example 2: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output 2\n\n And our code produces 2 for both.\n\n Therefore, we are done.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says the example outputs are ['2','2'].\n\n We output the integer 2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Output the answer to the problem.\"\n\n So we output an integer.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me run with the sample inputs.\n\n However, wait: the sample input format: the first two lines are the coordinates, then the number of roads, then the roads.\n\n But what if the input has extra spaces? The split() handles that.\n\n One more test: \n\n        Home: (0,0), University: (2,0)\n        Road: x=1 -> equation: x-1=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1.\n\n        For home: 1*0 +0*0 -1 = -1 -> negative.\n        For university: 1*2+0*0-1 = 1 -> positive.\n\n        Opposite sides -> count 1.\n\n        Expected: 1 step.\n\n        Now, how many roads separate (0,0) and (2,0) with respect to x=1? They are separated by the road x=1. So we must cross one road.\n\n        Therefore, output 1.\n\n        The code returns 1.\n\n Another test: \n\n        Home: (0,0), University: (0,2)\n        Road: y=1 -> equation: y-1=0 -> a=0, b=1, c=-1.\n\n        Home: 0*0+1*0-1 = -1 -> negative.\n        University: 0*0+1*2-1 = 1 -> positive.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n Therefore, we are confident.\n\n Submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road must be crossed exactly once if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university locations. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move between the two blocks.\n2. **Insight**: For each road, compute the side of the plane where the home and university lie using the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). If the evaluations of the line equation at the home and university coordinates have opposite signs, the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Algorithm**: Iterate over each road, evaluate the line equation at both home and university coordinates, and count how many roads have the points on opposite sides. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps required, as each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\) is evaluated at the home \\((x1, y1)\\) and university \\((x2, y2)\\) coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: The sign of the evaluated expressions determines which side of the road each point lies. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides, and the road must be crossed.\n4. **Counting Roads**: The count of such roads gives the minimum steps needed, as each road crossing is a separate step.\n5. **Output Result**: The total count of roads separating the home and university is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
