            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b (each between 2 and 25) OR one integer a and then either an integer b or the string 'R'. The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a. The number can have leading zeros but length <= 1000.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split into tokens. There will be two tokens. One of them might be 'R'.\n 2. Read the second line which is the number c in base a.\n\n Conditions:\n - If b is not 'R', then we convert the number from base a to base b.\n - If b is 'R', then we convert the number from base a to base 10 (as an integer) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note the problem statement: \n   \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: '16 R\\n5' -> Output: 'V'\n   Here, 5 in base 16 is just 5 (since 5 < 16). Then we convert 5 to Roman numeral -> 'V'.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: '5 R\\n4' -> Output: 'IV'\n\n But note: the input for base a is given as a string in base a. So we must first convert the string from base a to an integer (base 10) and then if b is R, convert that base-10 integer to Roman.\n\n However, the problem says: \n   \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\"\n\n But note: the number may have leading zeros. And the base a is between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Also, the base a representation can include digits from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ...? Actually, since base a is at most 25, the digits can go up to base-1. So for base 16, we use 0-9 and A-F. For base 26, we would use 0-9 and then A-Z? But the problem states bases from 2 to 25, so we don't need to worry beyond base 25.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Parse the first line:\n    tokens = input().split()\n    There are two tokens.\n\n    Example: \n        \"10 2\" -> a=10, b=2\n        \"16 R\" -> a=16, b='R'\n\n 2. Read the next line: s = input().strip()\n\n 3. Convert the string s from base a to an integer (base 10). But note: the string s might contain digits and letters. We have to map each character to a digit value.\n\n    How to convert from base a (with a<=25) to base 10?\n        Let the string be s (which can have leading zeros).\n\n        We can do: \n            num = 0\n            for each char in s:\n                digit_value = int(char) if char is a digit, else ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            But wait: what if the base a is 11? Then we cannot use 'A' for 10 if the base is 11? Actually, no: the base a representation uses digits that are less than a.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"in base a\", so the string s is given with digits that represent values from 0 to a-1.\n\n        But note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2, and the string is \"1111001\". This is valid.\n\n        We must validate that each character in s represents a digit in [0, a-1]. However, the problem says the input is in base a.\n\n        Steps for conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n            Let n = len(s)\n            base10 = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                # Map the character to a value\n                if s[i] in '0123456789':\n                    d = int(s[i])\n                else:\n                    d = 10 + (ord(s[i]) - ord('A'))\n\n                # Check if d is within [0, a-1]? Actually, the problem says it's in base a, so we assume it is.\n\n                base10 = base10 * a + d\n\n 4. Now, if b is an integer, we convert the base10 integer to base b.\n\n    But note: the base b is also between 2 and 25 (if it's not 'R').",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either a standard base (2-25) or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting this base 10 number to the desired output base (either standard base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and the target base (b). The target base can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string from the source base (a) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit or character in the input string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value in base 10.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base 10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral symbols and their subtractive forms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numerals(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    roman_map = [\n        ('M', 1000),\n        ('CM', 900),\n        ('D', 500),\n        ('CD', 400),\n        ('C', 100),\n        ('XC', 90),\n        ('L', 50),\n        ('XL', 40),\n        ('X', 10),\n        ('IX', 9),\n        ('V', 5),\n        ('IV', 4),\n        ('I', 1)\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for numeral, value in roman_map:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += numeral\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    base_a = int(a_str)\n\n    digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    \n    base10_num = 0\n    for char in num_str:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n        if d >= base_a:\n            pass\n        base10_num = base10_num * base_a + d\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        result = roman_numerals(base10_num)\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits_list = []\n            n = base10_num\n            while n > 0:\n                remainder = n % base_b\n                digits_list.append(digits[remainder])\n                n //= base_b\n            result = ''.join(digits_list[::-1])\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The first line of input is split into two parts. The first part is the source base (a), and the second part is the target base (b), which could be an integer or 'R'.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its numerical value based on its position (digit or letter). The numerical value is then used to compute the base 10 equivalent by accumulating the value appropriately.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base**: The base 10 number is converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. The remainders are then reversed to form the correct sequence of digits in the target base.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals by matching the largest possible Roman numeral values from a predefined list and subtracting their values from the number until it is reduced to zero. The resulting Roman numerals are concatenated to form the final output.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
