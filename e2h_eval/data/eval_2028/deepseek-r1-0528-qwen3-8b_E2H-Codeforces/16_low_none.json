Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to another if they share a non-zero boundary (i.e., a segment of a road). This means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road (and share a portion of that road).\n\n However, note: the problem says we can move from one block to another in one step if the common border has nonzero length. So we are essentially crossing one road at a time.\n\n But wait: the example input and output:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n   Output: 2\n\n Why is the answer 2? Let's think:\n\n The first road: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  => y = 0 (the x-axis)\n The second road: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  => x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n These two roads divide the plane into 4 quadrants. Home is at (1,1) (first quadrant) and University at (-1,-1) (third quadrant). To get from first to third, we must cross two roads (one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis). Therefore, minimum steps is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0   -> x = 0\n        0 1 0   -> y = 0\n        1 1 -3  -> x+y-3=0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Now we have three roads: the two axes and the line x+y=3. The home (1,1) is above the x-axis and right of the y-axis. The university (-1,-1) is below the x-axis and left of the y-axis. The third road x+y=3 doesn't pass through either (since 1+1=2<3 and -1+-1=-2<3). So the path from home to university still requires crossing two roads: the x-axis and the y-axis. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n Insight:\n Each road divides the plane. We can define a sign for each road for a point: for a road equation a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, we can compute the value d_i = a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i. Then, for two points (home and university) we can look at the sign of each road for both points.\n\n Note: The sign might be zero only if the point is on the road, but we are guaranteed that neither home nor university is on any road.\n\n For a given road i, the two points (home and university) will be on the same side if the sign (d_i) for both is positive or both negative, and on opposite sides if one is positive and the other negative.\n\n Now, how many roads separate the two points? Each road that separates the two points (i.e., the two points are on opposite sides) must be crossed exactly once in any path from home to university.\n\n However, note the movement: we can only move by crossing one road at a time, and the entire path must cross all the separating roads. But can we cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: because two roads intersect at a single point (unless they are the same, but they are not). So we cannot cross two roads simultaneously. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are crossed at an intersection? Then we can cross two roads in one step? \n\n Let me clarify: the problem states that you can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. When two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of one road. So if two blocks are separated by two different roads, then they don't share a border (they only meet at an intersection point, which is a set of measure zero). Therefore, to go from one block to another that is separated by two roads, we must take two steps: first crossing one road, then crossing the other.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n However, consider: what if two roads do not separate the two points? Then we don't need to cross them.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n Step 1: For each road i, compute:\n          d1_i = a_i * x1 + b_i * y",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key insight is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once, and no two roads can be crossed simultaneously in a single step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads separate the home and university blocks. Each road is an infinite line defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The home and university are located in different blocks separated by some of these roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides of the road. If they lie on opposite sides, crossing this road is necessary to move from one block to the other.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, this road separates the two points and must be crossed, contributing to the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0) or (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code calculates the value of the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these values differ, it means the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus this road must be crossed.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The total number of such separating roads is counted, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each step involves crossing one such road.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the count of roads separating the two blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the necessary crossings, ensuring optimal performance.",
