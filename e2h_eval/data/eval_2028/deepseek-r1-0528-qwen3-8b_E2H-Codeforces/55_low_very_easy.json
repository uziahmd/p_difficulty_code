Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means:\n - '0' can be moved freely to the left (because we can swap 0 and 1, and then later use the 1 and 2 swaps to move the 1s and 2s appropriately? But note: we cannot swap 0 and 2 directly.\n However, note that we can only swap adjacent 0-1 and 1-2. This implies that:\n\n Observation:\n Since we cannot swap 0 and 2 directly, but we can use 1 as an intermediary, we can think of the following:\n\n The relative order of the three digits is constrained by the allowed swaps.\n\n In fact, note:\n - We can move 0's arbitrarily to the left because if a 0 is next to a 1, we can swap them, and then if there is a 2, we cannot directly swap 0 and 2, but we can use the 1s to help.\n\n However, note that the problem allows swapping any two adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So:\n\n What are the invariants?\n Actually, we can consider that the swaps generate a graph on the three characters with edges between 0-1 and 1-2, but not 0-2. Therefore, the entire string can be rearranged arbitrarily for the same connected component? But wait, the graph has three nodes and two edges, so 0 and 2 are in different connected components? Not exactly: because 0 and 2 are connected via 1. So actually, the entire set {0,1,2} is connected. However, the moves are adjacent swaps, so we are effectively allowed to permute the string arbitrarily within the constraints of the relative orders of the three digits?\n\n But note: we cannot swap 0 and 2 without moving 1 in between. However, the key is that we can rearrange the digits arbitrarily? Actually, let's consider:\n\n Example: \"02\" -> is it possible to turn into \"20\"? \n   We cannot swap 0 and 2 directly. And we have no 1 in between? So if we have \"02\", we cannot change it to \"20\". \n\n But wait, what if we have \"012\": \n   Initially: \"012\"\n   We can swap the first two: \"102\"\n   Then swap the last two: \"120\"\n   Then swap the first two: \"012\" -> wait, but we want to get from \"02\" to \"20\", which has no 1. So without a 1, we cannot swap 0 and 2.\n\n Therefore, the presence of 1 is necessary to swap 0 and 2. \n\n Alternate approach: Think of the allowed swaps as being able to independently rearrange the 0s and 2s with the 1s acting as catalysts. However, note that we can also move 1s arbitrarily (since 1 can swap with 0 and 2). \n\n But note: the problem does not allow swapping 0 and 2 directly. So we can only change the relative order of 0 and 2 if there is at least one '1' somewhere that can be used to facilitate the swap. However, if we have no '1' at all, then we cannot change the relative order of 0 and 2.\n\n Actually, the problem says: we can swap adjacent 0 and 1, and adjacent 1 and 2. So the operations are:\n\n Operation1: Swap \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n Operation2: Swap \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n So we can break down the string into the three types, but note that 0 and 2 cannot be swapped unless there is a 1 that can be used to separate them.\n\n However, note that we can also consider that we are allowed to rearrange the entire string arbitrarily if we have enough 1s? Actually, the problem is similar to having two independent sorting networks for 0 and 2, but they are connected by the 1s.\n\n Insight:\n\n Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, we can think of the following:\n\n We can move all the 0s to the leftmost positions, then the 1s, then the 2s? But wait, we cannot necessarily move a 0 past a 2 without a 1. However, if we have a 1 between a 0 and a 2, then we can use that 1 to swap the 0 and the 1 (moving the 0 to the left) and then swap the 1 and the 2 (moving the 1 to the right) and then we can move the 0 further left. \n\n Alternatively, we can consider",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on the characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed directly unless there is at least one '1' present in the string. This is because swapping '0' and '2' requires an intermediate '1' to facilitate the movement. Therefore, the presence of '1's allows us to rearrange the entire string more freely.\n2. **Insight**: If there are no '1's in the string, then the only possible swaps are between '0' and '1' (which doesn't occur since there are no '1's) and between '1' and '2' (also not possible). Thus, the string remains unchanged. However, if there are '1's, we can use them to separate '0's and '2's, allowing us to sort the string into three distinct segments: all '0's, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Checking if there are any '1's in the string. If not, the string cannot be modified, so it remains as-is.\n   - If there are '1's, we split the string into three parts based on the positions of '1's. The idea is to move all '0's before the first '1', all '1's together, and all '2's after the last '1'. This effectively sorts the string into the lexicographically smallest configuration possible with the given operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    if '1' not in s:\n        print(s)\n        return\n        \n    parts = s.split('1')\n    zeros = ''.join('0' * part.count('0') for part in parts)\n    ones = ''.join('1' * part.count('1') for part in parts)\n    twos = ''.join('2' * part.count('2') for part in parts)\n    \n    result = zeros + ones + twos\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Check for '1's**: If the string contains no '1's, it is printed as-is because no swaps are possible.\n3. **Splitting the String**: The string is split into parts separated by '1's. Each part will contain sequences of '0's and '2's.\n4. **Counting Characters**: For each segment between '1's, we count the number of '0's and '2's. The counts of '1's are also recorded.\n5. **Constructing Result**: The result is constructed by concatenating all '0's, then all '1's, and finally all '2's. This ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n6. **Output**: The resulting string is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps to transform the string into its lexicographically smallest form by utilizing the presence of '1's to facilitate the necessary rearrangements.",
