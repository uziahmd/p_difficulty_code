The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can move only clockwise.\n\n However, note that Xenia starts at house 1. The tasks are given in order, and she must complete them in the given order (and complete all previous ones).\n\n Observation:\n Since the ring is circular, we might need to consider moving from one task to the next, possibly going around the circle.\n\n We can break down the problem: \n   Start at house 1.\n   For each task i (from 0 to m-1), we are required to be at house a_i.\n\n   But note: after completing a task, she is at that house, and then she must go to the next task's house.\n\n   However, because the ring is circular, if the next task's house is behind (in the counter-clockwise direction) then we have to go the long way? Actually, no: the movement is only clockwise.\n\n   How does the movement work?\n     From a current house x, to reach a next house y, if y >= x, then we move forward (y - x) steps.\n     But if y < x, then we cannot go backwards. Instead, we must go from x to n (which takes n - x steps) and then from 1 to y (which takes y steps). So total steps = (n - x + y).\n\n   Alternatively, we can also think of the entire circle as having n houses, so the distance from x to y in a clockwise ring is:\n        If y >= x: d = y - x\n        Else: d = (n - x) + y\n\n   But note: the problem says she starts at 1, and the tasks are given in an arbitrary order (but she must do them in order).\n\n   However, note that she must complete tasks in the given order, and after each task she is at the house of that task.\n\n   So, we can simulate:\n\n   Let current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n   For each task in the list of tasks:\n        d = compute_distance(current, task)\n        total_time += d\n        current = task\n\n   But wait: the example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        Steps:\n          Start at 1, then go to 3: \n            d1: from 1 to 3 -> 3-1 = 2 (if we use the condition that 3>=1) -> but wait, actually we can also calculate as: \n            Condition: 3>=1 -> 2 steps.\n\n          Then from 3 to 2: \n            Condition: 2<3 -> so we do (4-3+2)=3 steps.\n\n          Then from 2 to 3: \n            Condition: 3>=2 -> 1 step.\n\n          Total = 2+3+1 = 6. Matches.\n\n   Another example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        Start at 1, go to 2: 2-1=1.\n        Then from 2 to 3: 3-2=1.\n        Then from 3 to 3: 0.\n        Total=2.\n\n   However, note that the example input has two test cases provided in a single string representation. But the problem states that the input is two integers and then a list.\n\n   But wait: the problem says there are m integers on the second line.\n\n   However, the problem also says: \"Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" So if two consecutive tasks are at the same house, then the distance is 0.\n\n   But what if the next task is the same as the current? Then we don't move.\n\n   This approach seems straightforward.\n\n   However, note the constraints: n, m up to 10^5. Our simulation is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: let's test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: [3,2,3] for n=4, start=1.\n\n        Step1: from 1 to 3: \n            if 3>=1 -> distance = 3-1 = 2.\n\n        Step2: from 3 to 2: \n            since 2<3, distance = (4-3)+2 = 1+2 = 3.\n\n        Step3: from 2 to 3: \n            3>=2 -> distance = 1.\n\n        Sum = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n   Example 2: [2,3,3] for n=4, start=1.\n\n        Step1: from 1 to 2: 2-1=1.\n        Step2: from 2 to 3: 3-2=1.\n        Step3: from 3 to 3: 0.\n\n        Sum = 2.\n\n   But wait: the example input was given as two separate strings? Actually, the example input format is:\n\n        Input: \n            \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n            \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n and m ... The second line contains m integers ...\"\n\n        So we read the first line, split and convert to integers for n and m.\n        Then the second line, split and convert to integers for the list of tasks.\n\n   However, the example output is:\n\n        ['6', '2']\n\n   So the program should output 6 and then 2 for the two examples? But wait, the problem says:\n\n        Input: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n        This is confusing. Actually, the example input has two test cases? \n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the input description.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as two separate strings. But the typical competitive programming problem reads one test case per run.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The first line contains two integers n and m\", meaning one test case.\n\n   So our program should read one test case and output the answer.\n\n   But the example input is given as two examples in one block. In reality, we are to write a program that reads one test case.\n\n   So we assume that the input consists of one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Xenia lives in a city that has n houses built along the main ringroad.\" and then the rest.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        Read n and m.\n        Read the next line and split into m integers.\n\n   And then compute the total time.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the next task is in a house that is the same as the current? Then we don't add anything.\n\n   Let's code the function for distance:\n\n        def distance(x, y, n):\n            if y >= x:\n                return y - x\n            else:\n                return (n - x) + y\n\n   However, note: the example above from 3 to 2: \n        x=3, y=2, n=4 -> returns (4-3)+2 = 1+2=3, which is correct.\n\n   But wait, is this always the minimum? Yes, because we can only move clockwise.\n\n   However, let's check an alternative: from 3 to 2, we could go 3->4->1->2? That is 3 steps (3 to4:1, 4 to1:1, 1 to2:1 -> total 3). So the formula gives 3.\n\n   But note: the formula (n-x)+y is equivalent to (n-x) + y, which is the same as (n-x+y). \n\n   However, note that the entire circle is n houses, so the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but if negative we adjust by adding n and then taking modulus? Actually, the standard way is:\n\n        d = (y - x) % n   but that doesn't work for negative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also use:\n\n        d = (y - x) if y >= x else (y + n - x)\n\n   But note: the above formula is exactly what we have.\n\n   However, we can also express the clockwise distance as:\n\n        d = (y - x) % n   but if negative, we can do:\n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from x to y is: (y - x + n) % n, but wait:\n\n        For x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3+4)%4 = (3)%4 = 3. Correct.\n\n        For x=1, y=3, n=4: (3-1+4)%4 = (6)%4=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait, the modulus operation: if we do (y-x+n) % n, then for positive: \n            if y>=x: (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n, but if y>=x then y-x is positive and less than n? Not necessarily: if y-x >= n? Then we would get (y-x) % n which is not the same as y-x.\n\n        However, note that y and x are between 1 and n, so y-x is between -(n-1) and n-1.\n\n        We want the minimal clockwise steps. The clockwise steps from x to y is:\n\n            If we consider the circle, the direct clockwise distance is:\n                d = (y - x) % n, but if negative we add n and then take modulus? Actually, we can define:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            But if negative, we can do: \n                d = (y - x + n) % n\n\n        However, wait: \n            Example: x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3+4) %4 = 3 %4 = 3 -> correct.\n            Example: x=1, y=3, n=4: (3-1+4)%4 = 6%4=2 -> correct.\n\n        But what if we have x=3, y=5, and n=4? Wait, but y must be between 1 and n. So we don't have to worry about y>n.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"1 ≤ ai ≤ n\", so y is in [1, n].\n\n        Then, we can use: \n            d = (y - x + n) % n\n\n        But wait: if y>=x, then (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n. Since y-x <= n-1 (because y<=n and x>=1, so y-x <= n-1) then (y-x+n) is at most 2*n-1, but modulus n will give (y-x) if y-x < n? \n\n        Actually, if y>=x and y-x < n, then (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) because y-x+n is between n and 2n-1, and then modulo n is (y-x) (since y-x+n - n = y-x).\n\n        But wait: (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n + n % n? No, modulus is linear? Actually, (a+b) % n = (a%n + b%n) % n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            if d < 0: d += n   # then d is in [0, n-1]\n\n        But note: we don't want the distance to be 0 if we don't move? Actually, if we don't move, then d=0.\n\n        However, the modulus method gives:\n\n            d = (y-x) % n\n            if negative, we add n until non-negative? Actually, we can do:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            but if negative, we adjust.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            if d == 0 and y != x: # wait, if y==x then d=0, but if y!=x then d>0? Actually, if y==x, then (y-x)%n=0. But then we are done.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for negative: \n            In Python, (-1) % 4 gives 3, which is what we want.\n\n        So we can simply do:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            But wait: if y-x is negative, then (y-x)%n gives a positive value. However, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers gives a result in [0, n-1]. \n\n        Example: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> correct.\n\n        Example: (3-1)%4 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: (1-1)%4 = 0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that we are moving from house x to house y, and we are allowed to go the entire circle. The modulus method gives the clockwise distance? Actually, yes.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives the smallest nonnegative residue. And the clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) % n = y, but note: we are counting the actual steps (without wrapping around the modulus for the numbering). \n\n        But wait: the houses are numbered 1 to n. The modulus operation doesn't account for the numbering starting at 1. \n\n        Let me clarify: our houses are 1-indexed. However, the modulus operation is 0-indexed? \n\n        Actually, no: the modulus operation is independent of indexing. The distance from house x to house y is the same as (y - x) mod n, but we have to consider that the houses are arranged in a circle of n houses.\n\n        However, note: when we do (y-x) % n, we are effectively treating the circle as 0-indexed? \n\n        Example: n=4, houses 1,2,3,4. \n            From 3 to 2: \n                We can map house 1 to 0, house 2 to 1, house 3 to 2, house 4 to 3, then the distance from 2 (which is 3) to 1 (which is 2) in 0-indexed: (1-2) %4 = (-1)%4=3, but wait: in 0-indexed, the clockwise distance from 2 to 1 (which are consecutive in the circle) should be 3? \n\n        Actually, in 0-indexed, the clockwise distance from index 2 to index 1 in a circle of 4 would be (1 - 2 + 4) %4 = 3, which is correct.\n\n        But the problem is 1-indexed. However, we can use the same modulus formula because the relative positions are maintained.\n\n        However, note: the modulus formula (y-x) % n gives the distance in terms of steps if we consider the circle of n houses. But wait: if we consider 1-indexed, then the circle has n distinct positions. The modulus formula works because the difference in indices (if we subtract 1 from both) would be (y-1 - (x-1)) % n, but then we are back to the same modulus. \n\n        But we don't need to subtract 1 because the modulus operation is defined for integers.\n\n        However, there is a catch: if we use (y-x) % n, then when x=1 and y=1, (1-1)%4=0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the distance is 0? Then we don't move. \n\n        However, the modulus operation gives the minimal positive steps? Actually, no: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative steps. But note: the problem requires the actual steps taken. \n\n        The modulus operation gives the minimal number of steps to get from x to y in the clockwise direction, but note that sometimes going the other way might be shorter? \n\n        But wait, the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So we cannot go counter-clockwise. So the only way is clockwise. Therefore, the distance is exactly (y-x) mod n, but we must ensure that the result is nonnegative.\n\n        However, the modulus operation already gives a nonnegative result.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for (y-x) % n: \n            It returns a value in the range [0, n-1]. \n\n        However, if we consider the entire circle, the clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) mod n = y, but note: our houses are 1-indexed and the modulus operation is on the circle of n houses. \n\n        But wait: if we are at house x, then moving d steps clockwise lands us at house (x + d - 1) % n + 1? \n\n        Let me check: \n            House x: we can represent it as (x-1) in 0-indexed.\n\n            Then, after d steps: we land at (x-1 + d) % n + 1.\n\n            We want that to be y.\n\n            So: (x-1+d) % n + 1 = y  => (x-1+d) % n = y-1  => d = (y-1 - (x-1)) % n? \n\n            But wait, that's the same as (y-x) % n? \n\n            Actually, (y-1 - (x-1)) % n = (y-x) % n.\n\n        So the modulus formula is valid.\n\n        However, note: we must be cautious because the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python returns a nonnegative value. \n\n        But we can use:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n\n        However, wait: what if y-x is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n            Example: n=4, x=1, y=5 -> but y must be <=n, so y=5 is invalid. \n\n        Since the problem states that 1<= ai <=n, we don't have to worry about y>n.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation: if y-x is positive and >=n, then (y-x)%n = (y-x) % n, which is (y-x) - k*n for some k so that it falls in [0, n-1]. \n\n        Example: x=1, y=5, n=4 -> but y is 5, which is invalid. So we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says the ai are between 1 and n, so y is between 1 and n.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum y-x is (n-1) - 1 = n-2, which is less than n. Similarly, the minimum is 1-n, which is negative.\n\n        So the modulus formula works.\n\n        But wait: let me test with a large n and y>=x:\n\n            n=100000, x=1, y=50000: (50000-1)%100000 = 49999, which is the correct distance.\n\n            n=100000, x=50000, y=1: (1-50000)%100000 = (-49999)%100000 = 50001, which is the correct clockwise distance (going from 50000 to 100000 and then from 1 to 1? Actually, from 50000 to 100000: 50000 steps, then from 100000 to 1: 1 step? But wait, 100000 is the last house, then the next house is 1. So from 50000 to 1: \n                50000 -> 50001 -> ... -> 100000 (that's 50000 steps from 50000 to 100000) and then 100000 to 1 is 1 step, so total 50001. \n\n            The modulus formula gives 50001.\n\n        However, note: our original formula was:\n\n            if y>=x: d = y-x\n            else: d = (n-x)+y\n\n        Let's test with n=100000, x=50000, y=1 (which is <50000): d = (100000-50000)+1 = 50001.\n\n        So both formulas are consistent.\n\n        But the modulus formula is more concise.\n\n        However, note: the modulus formula in the case y>=x: \n            d = (y-x) % n\n            But if y-x < n, then (y-x) % n = y-x, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if y-x >= n? \n            Example: n=4, x=1, y=5 -> but y=5 is invalid because n=4. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n   # but wait, this gives the minimal nonnegative residue. However, note that the distance in the circle is the minimal steps? \n\n        But wait: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative residue, but the clockwise distance is defined as the minimal nonnegative steps? Yes.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives the same result as:\n\n            d = (y - x + n) % n   # because if y-x is negative, adding n makes it positive and then modulus n gives the same as (y-x) % n.\n\n        But wait, actually (y-x) % n is the same as (y-x+n) % n only if y-x is negative? \n\n        Example: y-x=-1, then (-1)%n = n-1, and (y-x+n)%n = (n-1)%n = n-1 -> same.\n\n        Example: y-x=5, n=4: 5%4=1, and (5+4)%4=9%4=1 -> same.\n\n        Actually, (a % n) is the same as (a + k*n) % n for any integer k. So we can add as many multiples of n as we want.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the modulus operation. We can use:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n\n        But wait, is this the same as the distance we calculated earlier?\n\n        Example: x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> matches.\n\n        Example: x=1, y=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2 -> matches.\n\n        Example: x=3, y=3, n=4: (3-3)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: x=2, y=3, n=4: (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative residue. However, note that the circle has n houses, so the distance from x to y is the same as the distance from y to x in the counter-clockwise direction? No, because we can only go clockwise.\n\n        But the modulus operation gives the clockwise distance? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation gives the clockwise distance if we consider the circle as having n houses and we are moving from x to y in the clockwise direction. \n\n        However, the modulus operation is defined for the additive group modulo n. The clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative d such that (x + d) ≡ y (mod n). \n\n        But wait: if we consider the circle of n houses, the positions are labeled 1 to n. We can map them to 0 to n-1 by subtracting 1. Then the condition becomes (x0 + d) mod n = y0, where x0=x-1, y0=y-1.\n\n        Then d_min = (y0 - x0) mod n, but in modular arithmetic, the solution is unique modulo n, and we take the smallest nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers returns a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But wait: what if the distance is 0? Then we don't move.\n\n        So we can compute the total time by:\n\n            current = 1\n            total = 0\n            for each task in the list:\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: if (task - current) is negative, then d is positive and correct. But if positive, then d is the positive difference.\n\n                However, wait: what if (task - current) is positive but greater than or equal to n? \n                    Example: n=4, current=1, task=5 -> but task=5 is invalid because n=4, so task is between 1 and n.\n\n                Since task is in [1, n], then (task - current) is between (1-1=0) and (n-1) at most. So the modulus operation is not necessary for positive? \n\n                Actually, if task >= current, then (task - current) is positive and <= n-1 (because task<=n and current>=1, so task-current <= n-1). Then (task - current) % n = task - current.\n\n                If task < current, then (task - current) is negative, and (task - current) % n = n + (task - current) (because the modulus operation in Python for negative adds n until the result is in [0, n-1]).\n\n                But wait, the modulus operation for negative: \n                    d = (task - current) % n\n                    This is equivalent to: d = (task - current) % n\n\n                However, we can also compute without modulus by:\n\n                    if task >= current:\n                        d = task - current\n                    else:\n                        d = n - current + task\n\n                And these two methods are equivalent.\n\n        We'll use the modulus method for simplicity.\n\n        But wait: the modulus method is actually doing the same thing as:\n\n            d = (task - current) % n\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integer. But we must be cautious because the modulus operation for positive numbers that are less than n is the same as the number.\n\n        However, the modulus operation for positive numbers that are greater than or equal to n would be different, but in our case, the maximum task is n and minimum current is 1, so the maximum positive difference is n-1, which is less than n. So modulus doesn't change positive numbers.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            d = (task - current) % n   if we rely on the fact that the positive difference is less than n.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation for a positive number that is less than n: \n            (task - current) % n = task - current   (since task-current is in [0, n-1])\n\n        For negative: \n            (task - current) % n = n + (task - current)   (because task-current is negative and we add n to make it positive)\n\n        So yes, it's the same.\n\n        However, we must note that the modulus operation is more general. But the problem constraints ensure that the absolute difference is at most n-1, so modulus is safe.\n\n        But wait: what if the current is 1 and task is 1? Then d=0, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for a in tasks:\n                # Calculate the distance from current to a\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # But wait: if a - current is negative, then d = (a - current) % n = n + (a - current) (which is positive)\n                # However, if a - current is positive, then d = a - current.\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n        Let's test with example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Start: current=1, total_time=0\n            a=3: d = (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> total_time=2, current=3\n            a=2: d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> total_time=5, current=2\n            a=3: d = (3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=6, current=3\n\n        This gives 6, which is correct.\n\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n            Start: current=1, total_time=0\n            a=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2\n            a=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3\n            a=3: d=0 -> total_time=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, wait: is this the minimal steps? \n\n        But note: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. And the problem does not allow counter-clockwise, so we must take the clockwise path.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example1: from 3 to 2: we computed 3 steps. But the problem says the optimal sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3. \n\n        How does that relate to our calculation?\n\n            Step1: 1->2->3: 2 steps (as we did: 2)\n            Step2: 3->4->1->2: 3 steps (as we did: 3)\n            Step3: 2->3: 1 step.\n\n        So our calculation matches the steps.\n\n        However, note that the modulus method does not account for the fact that we are moving in a circle of n houses, but we are just using the difference. \n\n        One more example: \n            n=5, tasks=[5,1,3]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Step1: 1->5: \n                d = (5-1)%5 = 4 -> so 4 steps: 1->2->3->4->5. Correct.\n            Step2: 5->1: \n                d = (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 (because -4 + 5 = 1). So 1 step: from 5, the next house is 1 (since the ringroad is clockwise, so after 5 comes 1). So 5->1: 1 step. Correct.\n            Step3: 1->3: 2 steps.\n\n            Total: 4+1+2 = 7.\n\n            Alternatively, we can simulate the moves: \n                Start at 1.\n                Move 4 steps: 1->2->3->4->5 (now at 5)\n                Then 1 step: 5->1 (now at 1)\n                Then 2 steps: 1->2->3.\n\n            So 7 steps.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus method gives the minimal steps in the clockwise direction, which is the only allowed direction.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation might be slightly slower than the if condition? But with n, m up to 10^5, modulus is O(1) and very fast.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python is implemented efficiently.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for a in tasks:\n                # Compute the clockwise distance from current to a\n                # d = (a - current) % n   but wait: what if (a - current) is negative? \n                # We know that the modulus operation in Python handles negatives.\n\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # But wait: if (a - current) is positive, then d = a - current, which is correct.\n                # But if (a - current) is negative, then d = n + (a - current) (because (a - current) % n = n + (a - current) if a - current is negative and |a-current| < n, which it is)\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 2+3+1=6 -> correct.\n\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 1+1+0=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example3: n=5, tasks=[5,1,3] -> 4+1+2=7 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the example input provided in the problem was:\n\n            Input: \n                ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n            This is two test cases? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n and m\", so one test case per input.\n\n        But the example input is given as two strings. We are to read from stdin.\n\n        Therefore, the program will read one test case.\n\n        However, the problem statement example input is two test cases? Or is it just showing two examples?\n\n        We are to write a program that reads one test case.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then describes the input.\n\n        So we assume one test case.\n\n        However, the sample input in the problem statement is provided as two separate examples. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.\"\n\n        So we output one integer.\n\n        We are ready.\n\n        But wait: wait a minute, the modulus operation might not be the standard way to compute clockwise distances in a 1-indexed circle? \n\n        Let me reexamine: \n\n            The circle has n houses: 1,2,...,n.\n\n            The clockwise distance from house x to house y is defined as:\n                If y >= x: y - x\n                Else: n - x + y\n\n            Now, we can also express this as:\n\n                d = (y - x) % n   but wait, in the example above, when y < x, (y-x) is negative and (y-x) % n = n + (y-x) which is n - x + y.\n\n            So yes, the modulus formula is exactly the same.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (y-x) % n is the same as (y-x+n) % n only when y-x is negative? Actually, no, the modulus operation is defined for all integers. \n\n        But we can use either.\n\n        Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n            current=1, a=3: (3-1)%4 = 2 -> correct.\n            current=3, a=2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> correct.\n            current=2, a=3: (3-2)%4 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n            current=1, a=2: 1 -> correct.\n            current=2, a=3: 1 -> correct.\n            current=3, a=3: 0 -> correct.\n\n        Example3: n=5, tasks=[5,1,3]\n            current=1, a=5: (5-1)%5=4 -> correct.\n            current=5, a=1: (1-5)%5=(-4)%5=1 -> correct.\n            current=1, a=3: (3-1)%5=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, in example3 the third step is from 1 to 3, so we are at 1 again? Actually, after the second task we are at house 1. Then we go to 3: which is 2 steps.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for (3-1)%5=2, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. Our modulus method accounts for that.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative steps, and since we cannot go counter-clockwise, the minimal steps is the clockwise steps.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, wait: what if the distance we compute is 0? Then we don't move, which is correct.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for a in tasks:\n                # The modulus method\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: let's test with",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimal time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The ringroad consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in the given order, moving only clockwise between houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Xenia can only move clockwise, so the distance from one house to another is calculated based on their positions. If the target house is ahead (i.e., has a higher number), the distance is simply the difference between the two house numbers. If the target house is behind (i.e., has a lower number), the distance is computed by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad (house `n`) and then continuing from house 1 to the target house.\n2. **Insight**: The distance from house `x` to house `y` in a clockwise direction can be efficiently calculated using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the distance `d` is given by `(y - x) % n`. This formula works because if `y >= x`, the result is `y - x` (direct movement). If `y < x`, the result is `(y - x + n) % n`, which effectively wraps around the ringroad.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task in the given order. For each task, we compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using the modulo operation. The total time is accumulated by summing these distances.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for a in tasks:\n        d = (a - current) % n\n        total_time += d\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of tasks (each specifying a house number).\n2. **Initialization**: We start with Xenia at house 1 (`current = 1`) and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task house `a`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: The clockwise distance from `current` to `a` is computed as `(a - current) % n`. This handles both direct moves (when `a >= current`) and wrapped moves (when `a < current`).\n   - **Accumulate Time**: The computed distance is added to `total_time`.\n   - **Update Position**: `current` is updated to `a` for the next iteration.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated `total_time` is printed, representing the minimal time required to complete all tasks in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
