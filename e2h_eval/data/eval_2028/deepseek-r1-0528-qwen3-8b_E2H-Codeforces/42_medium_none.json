Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of files and then a list of file sizes.\n We have two progress bars:\n   - First (current file): floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file i and having copied x bytes of it (from 0 to a_i)\n   - Second (total): floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_sum)\n\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 for which there exists a moment (after copying some byte) such that both progress bars show the same integer.\n\n Note: The moment is after copying a byte (so at the end of each byte copy, including the very beginning when nothing is copied).\n\n However, note that we cannot iterate over all possible moments because the total size can be up to 100*1000=100000 bytes (which is acceptable for n<=100, but 100000 is 100000 steps, and we have 100 files, so worst-case 100000*100 = 10e6, which is acceptable in Python? But wait, the example input has only one file or two, but worst-case 100 files each 1000 bytes -> 100000 bytes, and we would have 100000*100 = 10 million states. However, we must consider that we are going sequentially by files and within a file by bytes.\n\n But note: the problem says that we update after every byte. So we have to simulate every byte of every file.\n\n However, we are not required to output the exact moment, but only the set of percentages that appear simultaneously.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the first progress bar (for a file i) can take values: 0, floor(100*x/a_i) for x from 1 to a_i.\n Similarly, the second progress bar (for the entire process) can take values from 0 to 100, but only at specific points.\n\n But note: the entire process is sequential by files. We can break the process by file.\n\n Let total = sum(a_i). Then the second progress bar at the moment we have copied k bytes (k from 0 to total) is floor(100*k/total).\n\n Now, during the copying of the i-th file (which has size a_i), we have already copied S = (a_1+a_2+...+a_{i-1}) bytes, and then we copy x bytes (0<=x<=a_i). Then the second progress bar is floor(100*(S+x)/total).\n\n The first progress bar during the i-th file (if we are in that file) is floor(100*x/a_i). We require that there exists an x (integer from 0 to a_i) such that:\n     floor(100*x/a_i) = floor(100*(S+x)/total) = p\n\n for some integer p between 0 and 100.\n\n However, note: the same p might be achieved at different files and different x's.\n\n How to do it without iterating over every byte (which might be too slow if we do 100000 * 100)?\n\n But note: n<=100 and each a_i <=1000, so total <= 100000, but we have 100 files, so we cannot iterate 100000 * 100 = 10 million, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n However, let's see: worst-case 100000 * 100 = 10 million iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: we are iterating by file and then by each byte of that file. For the i-th file, we have a_i bytes. So the total iterations is the sum of a_i for all i, which is total <= 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, note: we are not iterating by the total bytes, but by each file's bytes. And the total number of bytes is 100000, so we do 100000 iterations. But wait: the problem says that we update after every byte. So we have to check each byte.\n\n But note: we don't need to check every byte necessarily for every p? Actually, we can record for each percentage p (from 0 to 100) whether we have seen it in both progress bars at the same time.\n\n However, we can simulate by file and by byte, and for each step (byte copied) we compute:\n   current_file_index i, and the number of bytes x (from 0 to a_i-1, but note: we start at 0 and then copy each byte one by one)\n\n But note: we have two progress bars. At step x (in the i-th file):\n   p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   p2 = floor(100 * (prefix_sum[i] + x) / total)   [where prefix_sum[i] = a_1+...+a_{i-1}]\n\n We require p1 == p2.\n\n However, we must consider that the same p might be achieved in multiple ways. We only need to know if p is achieved at least once.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read list a of n integers.\n 3. total = sum(a)\n 4. We'll keep a set (or boolean array) for percentages from 0 to 100 that are achieved.\n\n 5. We'll simulate file by file.\n\n    Let prefix = 0   # total bytes copied so far (before starting the next file)\n    For each file index i from 0 to n-1:\n        Let size = a[i]\n        For x from 0 to size:   # x is the number of bytes we have copied in this file (from 0 to size, inclusive)\n            If x==0, then we haven't started this file, but note: the previous file has been fully copied (unless it's the first file). \n            However, the problem says: initially both are 0. Then after copying the first byte of the first file, we update.\n\n            But note: at the very beginning (x=0 for the first file) we have 0% and 0%, so 0 is always achieved.\n\n            Then, current progress for the first bar: p1 = (100 * x) // size   [since floor division by size, and note: if x=0 then 0]\n            The total bytes copied so far = prefix + x\n            p2 = (100 * (prefix + x)) // total\n\n            If p1 == p2, then mark p1 as a valid percentage.\n\n        Then, after finishing the file, we update prefix += size.\n\n 6. But wait: what about the end of each file? Actually, we are including x=size for each file, which is the last byte of the file.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says: we update after every byte. So we must include every x from 0 to size (inclusive) for each file.\n\n 8. But note: the example input '1\\n6' gives 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. This means that we are expected to get these numbers.\n\n    Let's simulate the first example: n=1, a=[6], total=6.\n\n    prefix starts at 0.\n\n    File0: size=6.\n\n    x=0: p1 = (100*0)//6 = 0, p2 = (100*(0+0))//6 = 0 -> mark 0.\n    x=1: p1 = (100*1)//6 = 1, p2 = (100*(0+1))//6 = 1 -> mark 1.\n    x=2: p1 = 3, p2 = (200//6)=31 -> wait, no: (100*2)//6 = 3, (100*2)//6 = 3 -> mark 3? \n\n    But the example output includes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n    Why do we get 0,1,3,...?\n\n    Wait, the example output is: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n    Our simulation for the first example only gives 0,1,3,5,8,11,14,16,...? Actually, let's do it properly:\n\n    We are using integer floor division.\n\n    x=0: 0\n    x=1: 100//6 = 16 (because 100*1 = 100, 100//6 = 16.66... -> floor is 16) -> wait, no: wait the formula is floor(100*x/size). \n\n    Actually, in the example they say: floor(100*x/a_i). \n\n    So for x=1: floor(100*1/6) = floor(100/6) = floor(16.66...) = 16.\n\n    So I made a mistake: the formula is (100*x) // size, but note: 100*x is an integer, and then divided by size (integer division) is the same as floor(100*x/size).\n\n    But wait: in Python, (100*x)//size is integer floor division. However, 100*x might be a float if we use 100*x as a float, but here we use integers.\n\n    Actually, the example: \n        x=1: (100*1)//6 -> 100//6 = 16 (because 6*16=96 < 100, so 100/6 ~16.66 -> floor is 16).\n        x=2: (200)//6 = 33 (because 6*33=198, 198<200, so 200/6 ~33.33 -> floor 33).\n\n    So the example output for the first example is: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n    Now, let's recompute with the correct formula:\n\n        x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> mark 0.\n        x=1: p1=100//6 = 16, p2= (100*1)//6 = 16 -> mark 16.\n        x=2: p1=200//6 = 33, p2= (100*2)//6 = 33 -> mark 33.\n        x=3: p1=300//6=50, p2= (100*3)//6=50 -> mark 50.\n        x=4: p1=400//6=66, p2= (100*4)//6=66 -> mark 66.\n        x=5: p1=500//6=83, p2= (100*5)//6=83 -> mark 83.\n        x=6: p1=600//6=100, p2= (100*6)//6=100 -> mark 100.\n\n    So indeed we get {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\n    Why did I think x=1 gives 1 earlier? I mistakenly computed 100*x//size without realizing that 100*x is 100, and 100//6 is 16.\n\n 9. Therefore, we can simulate by iterating each file and then each byte in that file.\n\n    However, note: the second progress bar uses the total sum of all files (including the ones we haven't started). So we must compute total = sum(a) at the beginning.\n\n    Also, we must keep track of the total bytes copied so far (the prefix) for the second progress bar.\n\n 10. Implementation:\n\n     n = int(input().strip())\n     a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n     total = sum(a_list)\n\n     # We'll create a set for the percentages that occur.\n     achieved = set()\n\n     # Start with 0 bytes copied, so both are 0.\n     # We'll simulate file by file.\n\n     prefix = 0   # total bytes before the current file\n     for i in range(n):\n         size = a_list[i]\n         # For each byte x in the current file (from 0 to size)\n         for x in range(0, size+1):\n             # The current file's progress: floor(100*x/size)\n             p1 = (100 * x) // size\n             # The total bytes copied so far: prefix + x\n             p2 = (100 * (prefix + x)) // total\n\n             if p1 == p2:\n                 achieved.add(p1)\n\n         # After finishing this file, update prefix\n         prefix += size\n\n 11. Then we output the sorted list of achieved percentages from 0 to 100, but note: we are only adding percentages that are achieved, and we don't have to worry about duplicates.\n\n 12. However, note: the problem says \"в возрастающем порядке\", so we must output in increasing order.\n\n 13. But note: we might have achieved percentages that are above 100? Actually, the maximum for p1 is 100 (when x=size) and for p2 is 100 (when prefix+x = total). So we are safe.\n\n 14. Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 2: Input: \"2\\n100 500\"\n\n    total = 600\n\n    First file: size=100, prefix starts at 0.\n\n        x from 0 to 100:\n          x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n          x=1: p1 = (100*1)//100 = 1, p2 = (100*1)//600 = 0 -> not equal.\n          ...\n          x=16: p1 = (100*16)//100 = 16, p2 = (100*16)//600 = 2 -> not equal.\n          ...\n          x=60: p1 = (100*60)//100 = 60, p2 = (100*60)//600 = 10 -> not equal.\n          ...\n          x=100: p1=100, p2=(100*100+100*0) wait: wait, at x=100, prefix+x = 0+100 = 100, so p2=100*100//600 = 100//6 = 16 -> wait, 100*100=10000, 10000//600 = 16 (since 16*600=9600, 17*600=10200) -> so 16. But 100 != 16.\n\n        Actually, wait: the second progress bar at the end of the first file is (100*100)//600 = 10000//600 = 16.\n\n        Then, the second file: size=500, prefix now is 100.\n\n        Then for x from 0 to 500:\n\n          x=0: p1=0, p2= (100*100)//600 = 16 -> 0 !=16.\n          ...\n          When does p1 become 16? (100*x)//500 = 16 -> 100*x >= 16*500 = 8000 -> x>=80 (because 100*80=8000, then 8000//500=16). \n          Then at x=80: \n             p1 = (100*80)//500 = 16\n             p2 = (100*(100+80))//600 = (100*180)//600 = 18000//600 = 30 -> not equal.\n\n          Then we look for p1=p2.\n\n        But the example output for the second example is: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        This example output is from the sample input: \n            Input: ['2\\n100 500'] -> Output: ['0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100']\n\n        So how do we get 95,96,97,98,99,100?\n\n        Let's see the entire process:\n\n        After the first file (100 bytes): \n            Total bytes = 100, so the second progress bar is 100*100//600 = 16.\n\n        Then we start the second file (500 bytes). The second progress bar will go from 16 to 100 (but in steps of 1/600 per byte?).\n\n        The first progress bar for the second file goes from 0 to 100.\n\n        We are looking for x (in [0,500]) such that:\n            (100*x)//500 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n        Let p be the common value.\n\n        Then we have two conditions:\n            p <= (100*x)/500 < p+1   => 500*p <= 100*x < 500*(p+1)  => 5*p <= x < 5*(p+1)\n            p <= (100*(100+x))/600 < p+1  => 600*p <= 100*(100+x) < 600*(p+1)  => 6*p <= 100+x < 6*(p+1)  => 6*p - 100 <= x < 6*(p+1) - 100\n\n        We are looking for integer x in [0,500] that satisfies both.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate x from 0 to 500 and check.\n\n        But note: the example output says 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        So we must get 0 at the beginning (already got from the first file) and then 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        How do we get 100?\n            In the second file, x=500: \n                p1 = (100*500)//500 = 100\n                p2 = (100*(100+500))//600 = (100*600)//600 = 100 -> so 100 is added.\n\n        Now, 99?\n            p1 = 99: then 99 <= (100*x)/500 < 100 -> 99*5 <= x < 100*5 -> 495 <= x < 500. So x can be 495,496,497,498,499.\n            Then check the second condition for p=99:\n                99 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 100 -> \n                Lower bound: 99*600 <= 100*(100+x) -> 59400 <= 10000 + 100*x -> 49400 <= 100*x -> x>=494.\n                Upper bound: 100*(100+x) < 100*600 -> 100+x < 600 -> x<500, which is already satisfied.\n\n                So x must be in [494,499]. But from the first condition we require x in [495,499]. So x in [495,499] is the intersection.\n\n                Check x=495: \n                    p1 = (100*495)//500 = 49500//500 = 99\n                    p2 = (100*(100+495))//600 = (100*595)//600 = 59500//600 = 99 (since 99*600=59400, 59500-59400=100, so 99+100/600 -> floor is 99)\n\n                Similarly for 496,497,498,499: \n                    p1 remains 99 (until x=500, then becomes 100).\n                    p2: \n                        x=496: (100*596)//600 = 59600//600 = 99 (59600/600=99.333... -> floor 99)\n                        x=497: 59700//600 = 99.5 -> 99\n                        x=498: 59800//600 = 99.666... -> 99\n                        x=499: 59900//600 = 99.833... -> 99\n\n                So for x=495 to 499, p1=99 and p2=99. So 99 is achieved.\n\n        Similarly, 98?\n            Condition for p1=98: 98*5 <= x < 99*5 -> 490 <= x < 495.\n            Condition for p2=98: 98*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 99*600 -> 58800 <= 10000+100*x < 59400 -> 48800 <= 100*x < 49400 -> 488 <= x < 494.\n\n            Intersection: [490,494) -> x=490,491,492,493.\n\n            Check x=490:\n                p1 = (100*490)//500 = 49000//500 = 98\n                p2 = (100*(100+490))//600 = 59000//600 = 98 (since 59000/600 = 98.333...)\n\n            Similarly, x=491,492,493: \n                p1= (100*x)//500: \n                    491: 49100//500=98\n                    492: 49200//500=98\n                    493: 49300//500=98 (because 49300/500=98.6 -> floor 98)\n\n                p2 for x=493: (100*593)//600 = 59300//600 = 98 (since 59300/600=98.833...)\n\n            So 98 is achieved.\n\n        Similarly, we can check 96,97, etc.\n\n        But wait: why 95 is achieved?\n\n        For p1=95: \n            Condition: 95*5 <= x < 96*5 -> 475 <= x < 480.\n            Condition for p2=95: 95*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 96*600 -> 57000 <= 10000+100*x < 57600 -> 47000 <= 100*x < 47600 -> 470 <= x < 476.\n\n            Intersection: [475,476) -> x=475.\n\n            Check x=475:\n                p1 = (100*475)//500 = 47500//500 = 95\n                p2 = (100*(100+475))//600 = 57500//600 = 95 (since 57500/600 = 95.833...)\n\n            So 95 is achieved.\n\n        And then 96?\n            p1=96: 96*5<=x<97*5 -> 480<=x<485.\n            p2=96: 96*600<=100*(100+x)<97*600 -> 57600<=10000+100*x<58200 -> 48800<=100*x<48200? -> wait, 48800<=100*x -> x>=488, and 100*x<48200 -> x<482. This is impossible (488>482). \n\n        Wait, that doesn't match. Let me recast the second condition for p2=96:\n\n            Condition: 96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n            Multiply by 6: 576 <= 100*(100+x) < 582\n            But 100*(100+x) is 10000+100*x, so:\n                576 <= 10000+100*x < 582   -> subtract 10000: 576-10000 <= 100*x < 582-10000 -> negative and positive? \n\n        Correction: The second condition for p2=96 is:\n\n            floor( (100*(100+x)) / 600 ) = 96\n\n            This is equivalent to: 96 <= (100*(100+x)) / 600 < 97\n\n            Multiply by 600: 96*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97*600\n            -> 57600 <= 100*(100+x) < 58200\n            -> 57600 <= 10000 + 100*x < 58200\n            -> 47600 <= 100*x < 48200\n            -> 476 <= x < 482.\n\n        Then for p1=96: x must be in [480,485). The intersection with [476,482) is [480,482). So x=480,481.\n\n        Check x=480:\n            p1 = (100*480)//500 = 48000//500 = 96\n            p2 = (100*(100+480))//600 = 58000//600 = 96 (since 58000/600=96.666...)\n\n        x=481: \n            p1 = 48100//500 = 96 (since 48100/500=96.2 -> floor 96)\n            p2 = 58100//600 = 96 (58100/600=96.833...)\n\n        So 96 is achieved.\n\n        Similarly, 97?\n            p1=97: 97*5<=x<98*5 -> 485<=x<490.\n            p2=97: 97*600<=100*(100+x)<98*600 -> 58200<=10000+100*x<58800 -> 48200<=100*x<48800 -> 482<=x<488.\n\n            Intersection: [485,488) -> x=485,486,487.\n\n            Check x=485:\n                p1 = (100*485)//500 = 48500//500 = 97\n                p2 = (100*(100+485))//600 = 58500//600 = 97 (58500/600=97.5 -> floor 97)\n\n            Similarly for 486,487.\n\n        So 97 is achieved.\n\n        And 98,99,100 we already saw.\n\n        Therefore, the set is {0,95,96,97,98,99,100}. \n\n        Why did we not get 1,2,...,94? Because the second progress bar only reaches 95 at x=475 (and then again later at 95,96,...) but the first progress bar in the second file starts at 0 and increases to 100, and the second progress bar starts at 16 and increases to 100. They only meet at the high percentages (95 and above) and also at 0.\n\n        However, note: we also have the first file. In the first file, we had:\n            x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> 0 is achieved.\n            Then the second file: we get 0 at the beginning (x=0) but at that point p2=16, so 0 is not repeated at the start of the second file.\n\n        But wait, at the start of the second file (x=0) we have:\n            p1=0, p2= (100*(100+0))//600 = 16 -> not 0.\n\n        So only 0 is achieved at the very beginning and the end of the first file.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\". So 0 is achieved.\n\n        Now, why didn't we get any other percentage from the first file? We did: the first file only had percentages that are multiples of (100/100)=1, but the second progress bar was updating with the total (600). The first file: x from 0 to 100, so p1 = (100*x)//100 = x (since 100*x//100=x). And p2 = (100*(x))//600. \n\n        We need x = (100*x)//600 for some x in [0,100]. \n\n        Solve: x = (100*x)//600\n\n        This implies: 600*x >= 600*x, and also 100*x < 600*(x+1) is always true for nonnegative x? Actually, we need:\n\n            x <= (100*x)/600 < x+1   [because floor((100*x)/600) = x]\n\n        But note: (100*x)/600 = x/6, so we require x <= x/6 < x+1.\n\n        For x>0: x <= x/6 is false unless x=0.\n\n        So only x=0 works in the first file (other than 0, no other integer x in [1,100] satisfies x = floor(100*x/600) because floor(100*x/600) is at most floor(100*100/600)=floor(16.66)=16, which is less than x (which is from 1 to 100). \n\n        Therefore, the first file only gives 0 and 16 (at x=100) and then the second file gives the rest.\n\n        But wait, we found 16 in the first file at x=100, but then the second file also might have 16? \n\n        In the second file, we require p1=16 and p2=16.\n\n        p1=16: 16 <= (100*x)/500 < 17 -> 16*5 <= x < 17*5 -> 80<=x<85.\n\n        p2=16: 16 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 17 -> 16*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 17*600 -> 9600 <= 10000+100*x < 10200 -> subtract 10000: -400<=100*x<200 -> but 100*x is positive, so 0<=100*x<200 -> 0<=x<2. \n\n        The intersection of [80,85) and [0,2) is empty.\n\n        So 16 is only achieved in the first file.\n\n        Similarly, 1,2,...,15 are achieved only in the first file? Actually, no: the first file's second progress bar was (100*x)//600, which for x=1 to 15: \n            p2 = (100*x)//600 = 0 for x from 0 to 5 (since 100*5=500, 500//600=0) and then x=6: 600//600=1, so 1 is achieved at x=6 in the first file.\n\n        But wait: in the first file, at x=6:\n            p1 = (100*6)//100 = 6\n            p2 = (100*6)//600 = 1 -> 6 != 1.\n\n        Similarly, at x=1: p1=1, p2=0 -> not equal.\n        at x=2: p1=2, p2=0\n        ...\n        at x=5: p1=5, p2=0\n        at x=6: p1=6, p2=1\n        at x=7: p1=7, p2=1\n        at x=8: p1=8, p2=1\n        ...\n        until x=100: p1=100, p2=16.\n\n        So in the first file, we only get the same p1 and p2 when p1 = p2. This happens when:\n            (100*x)//100 = (100*x)//600\n\n        We saw that only x=0 and x=100 (which gives 100 and 100) and also we found x=60: p1=60, p2= (100*60)//600=10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that can be simultaneously displayed on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are updated after each byte is copied and are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process byte by byte for each file. For each byte copied, we calculate the current progress percentage for the file being copied and the overall progress percentage for all files combined. We then check if these two percentages match at any point during the copying process.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute the two progress percentages at every step. If they match, we record that percentage. The challenge is to efficiently track these matches without missing any valid percentages.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward simulation of the copying process. For each file, we iterate through each possible byte (from 0 to the file size) and compute the two progress percentages. If they are equal, we add the percentage to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(total bytes), where total bytes is the sum of all file sizes. Given that each file size is at most 1000 bytes and there are up to 100 files, the maximum number of operations is 100,000, which is efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    total = sum(a_list)\n    achieved = set()\n    \n    prefix = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        size = a_list[i]\n        for x in range(0, size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // size\n            p2 = (100 * (prefix + x)) // total\n            if p1 == p2:\n                achieved.add(p1)\n        prefix += size\n        \n    result = sorted(achieved)\n    print('\\n'.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: It calculates the total size of all files and initializes a set to keep track of achieved percentages.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, the code iterates through each byte (from 0 to the file size). For each byte, it computes the current file's progress percentage (`p1`) and the overall progress percentage (`p2`). If these percentages match, the value is added to the set.\n4. **Output**: After processing all files, the achieved percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible points during the copying process where the two progress bars might show the same percentage, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
