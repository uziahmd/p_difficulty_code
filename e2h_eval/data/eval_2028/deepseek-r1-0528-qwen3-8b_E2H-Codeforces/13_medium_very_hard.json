For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of 3 space-separated notes. The notes are in the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] and they are cyclic (so after H comes C, and before C is H).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone from C (which is 0). Then the entire octave is cyclic with 12 notes.\n\n    Note mapping:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   [But wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the last one? However, in standard music, B is the 7th note and then C is the next, but here they use H for what we know as B? Actually, the problem states the list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    However, note that the example input includes \"A B H\", which is the last three notes: A (9), B (10), H (11). But wait, in standard, after A comes B and then C. Here, they have H as the last note. So the mapping is:\n\n        C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we can generate all permutations of the three notes and check for the two conditions.\n\n Conditions for major: \n     There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n         dist(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n         dist(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n     Then the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\n Conditions for minor:\n     There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n         dist(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n         dist(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n 3. How to compute distance? We have to consider the circular nature (the octave is 12 semitones). The distance from note a to note b is (b - a) mod 12, but if we are going from a lower note to a higher note, we might get a negative. However, note that the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we are only considering the ascending order.\n\n    But note: the problem says the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. That means we are allowed to wrap around. However, the condition for the triad requires the distances to be 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) without wrapping? Actually, let's read the example: \n        Example 1: \"C E G\" -> C to E: 4 semitones (C->C#=1, C#->D=2, D->D#=3, D#->E=4) -> so 4.\n        Then E to G: E->F=1, F->F#=2, F#->G=3 -> 3.\n\n    But if we have a chord that wraps, for example, from H to C: \n        H (11) to C (0): \n            Without wrap: 0 - 11 = -11, but we want positive. The problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest, so we don't necessarily wrap when calculating adjacent steps.\n\n    However, note that the chord definition does not require the notes to be consecutive in the circle without wrapping. The condition is about the intervals in the ordered set. But wait, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n    How do we interpret \"distance along the musical scale\"? It should be the minimal ascending path? Actually, the example says the distance from E to C is 8, meaning we don't take the minimal wrap but the ascending from E to C: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C? That would be 8 semitones (because from E to C: E,F,F#,G,G#,A,B,H,C -> 8 steps). \n\n    But wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we consider the entire circle and the distance from E to C is the way that goes from E to C passing through the next octave? Actually, the problem says: \"after H goes C again\", so the scale is cyclic. However, the example says the distance between E and C is 8. Let me break down:\n\n        E is at 4, then next notes: F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), then C(12 which is 0 mod12). So from E(4) to C(0) we go 4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->0: that's 8 steps.\n\n    So the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if we are going from a to b and a > b, then we add 12. In other words, the distance is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we add 12 until positive. Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n        However, if (b - a) is negative, then (b - a) % 12 gives a positive value by adding 12.\n\n    But wait: the example: E (4) to C (0): (0-4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8. Correct.\n\n    However, note that the condition for the chord is about consecutive intervals. In the major chord, we have two consecutive intervals: 4 and 3, so total 7. The entire chord spans 7 semitones, but note that the three notes must be distinct and we are ordering them in ascending order (so the entire set is contained in an interval of 7 semitones? Actually, no: the entire set might be spread over more than 7, but the condition is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3, and the entire set must be three distinct notes.\n\n    But note: the chord is defined by the two intervals. The problem doesn't require the entire chord to be within an octave. However, the example doesn't wrap.\n\n    However, consider a chord that wraps: e.g., notes [H, C, E]. Then we can order them as [H, C, E]. The distance from H to C: (0 - 11) % 12 = (0-11) %12 = (-11)%12 = 1? That's not right because the example says from E to C is 8, so from H to C should be 1? Actually, if we are going from H to C, we can also think of it as moving forward: from H (11) to C (0) is 1 step (if we consider the cycle). But the problem says: \"distance from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n    Let me clarify: the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning that we are measuring from E (which is lower) to C (which is higher) and we have to go around the cycle. Similarly, from H to C: if we consider the next octave, then from H to C is 1 semitone. But wait, in the example, the chord \"C# B F\" is minor. The example orders it as \"B C# F\": \n        B to C#: (1 - 10) %12 = (1-10) %12 = (-9)%12 = 3 -> 3 semitones.\n        C# to F: (5 - 1) %12 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> 4 semitones.\n\n    However, note that in the example, the chord is given as \"C# B F\", and the ordering is \"B, C#, F\". So we must consider the entire circle.\n\n    Therefore, the distance function should be:\n\n        def dist(a, b):\n            # a and b are numbers (0-11)\n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            # But wait, the example: from E to C: (0-4)%12 = -4 %12 = 8, which is correct.\n            # However, we are always taking the positive modulus. This gives the minimal positive steps in the circle? Actually, the modulus operation for negative gives the positive equivalent.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we are effectively going from the lower note to the higher note, even if that means wrapping? Actually, no: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the uppest. So if we have two notes, we always take the minimal positive distance? Or the one that goes in the ascending direction?\n\n    Let me read: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". They don't say minimal. They say from E to C is 8. But note, the minimal distance from E to C is 8? Actually, the minimal distance in a circle of 12 would be min(|8|, 12-8) but wait, the example says 8. So they are not taking the minimal distance. They are taking the distance in the ascending direction (without wrapping backwards). \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we consider the entire circle and we are going from the lower note to the higher note, and if the higher note is actually lower in the next octave, then we wrap.\n\n    But wait, in the example, E is 4 and C is 0. 0 is lower than 4? No, in the circle, after H comes C, so the circle goes: ... , 10(B), 11(H), 0(C), 1(C#)... So 0 is the same as 12. Then E is 4, which is between 0 and 11? Actually, the circle is cyclic and we don't have a fixed starting point. But the problem says \"after H goes C\", so the circle is: C (0), C#(1), ... H(11), then back to C(0).\n\n    How do we compare two notes? We can assign a linear representation: [0,1,...,11] and then the distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12, but if we want the ascending distance from a to b (without going backwards) then:\n\n        If b >= a, then distance = b - a.\n        If b < a, then distance = (12 - a) + b.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use: \n        distance = (b - a) % 12\n        But if we want the ascending distance without crossing the octave boundary, we might have two possibilities? However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, which is the ascending way (because we are going from E to C, and E is at 4, then we go to 5,6,...,11,0 -> that's 8). \n\n    Actually, the problem does not specify minimal distance. It specifies the distance from the lowest to the highest, meaning that we are considering the entire set of notes and we are ordering them in increasing order (with wrap-around). \n\n    However, note: the example \"C E G\" doesn't wrap. The example \"C# B F\" doesn't wrap. The example \"A B H\" does not wrap (A=9, B=10, H=11 -> ascending). \n\n    But consider the chord \"B C E\": \n        Notes: B (10), C (0), E (4)\n        Order by ascending: [C(0), B(10), E(4)] -> wait, but 0,10,4: we need to sort the entire set in the circular way? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes\". So we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. The condition is about the distances in the ordered sequence.\n\n    However, the ordering must be such that we are going from the lowest to the highest. But the circle complicates. \n\n    Let me define: we have three distinct notes. We can represent them as three points on a circle of 12. We can order them in the natural way (without wrapping) or with wrapping? \n\n    Example: chord [B, C, E] (notes 10,0,4). We can order them as [0,4,10] (which is C, E, B). Then the distances:\n        C to E: 4\n        E to B: (10-4) %12 = 6 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n    Alternatively, we can order them as [0,10,4] (C, B, E). Then:\n        C to B: (10-0) %12 = 10 -> not 4 or 3.\n        B to E: (4-10) %12 = (4-10) %12 = -6 %12 = 6 -> not 3.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider wrapping: the circle. The problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. So the lowest note is the one that starts the sequence. But in a circle, the \"lowest\" is arbitrary. However, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, meaning we are traversing the circle in the positive direction.\n\n    Another approach: we can normalize the three notes to start from 0. But wait, the problem doesn't fix the octave. We can consider the circle and the three points. We can break the circle at the note with the smallest value, but then we might have to consider that the highest note might be in the next octave.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider the three intervals (without fixing the starting point) and check if they form the pattern (4,3) or (3,4) in some cyclic shift.\n\n    Steps for checking a given set of three notes:\n\n        Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers from 0 to 11). We can consider all 6 permutations and check the two consecutive intervals.\n\n        For a permutation (x, y, z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12   -> but wait, this modulus might give a negative. Actually, we want the positive distance in the circle, so we do:\n\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n            Then we require that d1 and d2 are either (4,3) for major or (3,4) for minor.\n\n        However, note: the example E to C: (0-4)%12 = 8, which is correct, but the condition for major requires 4 and then 3. In the chord [C, E, G]: \n            C=0, E=4, G=7.\n            d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4\n            d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major.\n\n        Now, consider the chord [E, G, C]: \n            E=4, G=7, C=0.\n            d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3\n            d2 = (0-7)%12 = (0-7) %12 = -7 %12 = 5 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        So we must consider the correct ordering. The problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as...\" meaning we are allowed to choose the starting note and the direction? Actually, the ordering must be the ascending order in the circle.\n\n        But note: the condition does not specify the direction. However, the example \"C E G\" is ordered from C to E to G, which is ascending without wrap. \n\n        How to get the ascending order in the circle? We can break the circle at the smallest note. However, the smallest note is the one with the smallest number? But wait, the circle: 0=C, 1=C#, ... 11=H, then 0 again. So if we have two notes, the smallest one is the one with the smallest number. But if we have a set that wraps, for example [10,0,4]: the smallest is 0, then 4, then 10.\n\n        So algorithm for a set {a,b,c}:\n\n            Step 1: Convert the three notes to numbers.\n            Step 2: Sort the three numbers. But wait, if we sort numerically, then [0,4,10] is sorted. Then we can compute the distances from 0 to 4 and 4 to 10: 4 and 6. Not 4 and 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the circle: the three notes divide the circle into three arcs. The chord condition is that the three notes must have two arcs of 4 and 3 (in consecutive order) and the third arc is 5 (because 12-4-3=5). \n\n        But note: the condition is about two consecutive intervals (the two adjacent ones). \n\n        Another idea: since the chord has three distinct notes, we can compute the three intervals (in the circle) and then check if the set of intervals (when traversed consecutively) contains the pattern.\n\n        However, the problem says the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals. So we are only concerned with two adjacent intervals, and the third one is the remaining.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can arrange them in a circular list. Then we can consider the three possible starting points and the two consecutive intervals from that start.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the six permutations and for each permutation (x,y,z) we check:\n\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                But note: the modulus might give a negative? Actually, we can define:\n\n                    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                However, if we do modulus, then (y-x) might be negative and then we add 12 until positive. But the condition for the chord is that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n            But wait: the example [E, G, C]: \n                E=4, G=7, C=0.\n                d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3\n                d2 = (0-7)%12 = (0-7) %12 = -7 %12 = 5 (because -7 + 12 = 5)\n\n            Then we check: 3 and 5 -> not matching.\n\n            Now, consider the same set but in a different order: [C, E, G] -> [0,4,7]: \n                d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> matches major.\n\n            So we must try all permutations.\n\n            There are 6 permutations. We'll try:\n\n                [0,4,7]: 4,3 -> major.\n                [0,7,4]: d1=(7-0)=7, d2=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)%12=9 -> not.\n                [4,0,7]: d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(7-0)%12=7 -> not.\n                [4,7,0]: d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> not.\n                [7,0,4]: d1=(0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> not.\n                [7,4,0]: d1=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)%12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> not.\n\n            So only one permutation works.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            notes = input().split()\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            n1, n2, n3 = [mapping[x] for x in notes]\n\n            perms = set(permutations([n1, n2, n3]))\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                x, y, z = p\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                # But wait: the modulus operation for negative: \n                #   d1 = (y-x) %12: if y-x is negative, then we add 12 until positive.\n                #   Similarly for d2.\n\n                # However, note: the condition for the chord requires two consecutive intervals. But the entire set of three notes must be distinct, and the intervals must be exactly 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n                # But note: the circle is 12, so the third interval is (z-x)%12, and we must have d1+d2+(z-x)%12 = 12? Actually, no: the three intervals in the circle are d1, d2, and (x-z)%12? Actually, the circle is broken at x, then we have y and z. The entire circle is 12, so the three intervals (from x to y, y to z, z to x) must sum to 12. However, we are not using the third interval.\n\n                # We only check the two consecutive intervals.\n\n                # Condition for major: d1==4 and d2==3.\n                # Condition for minor: d1==3 and d2==4.\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n\n            Then, if found_major: print \"major\"\n            elif found_minor: print \"minor\"\n            else: print \"strange\"\n\n        However, wait: is it possible that the same chord has two different patterns? The problem says the answer is unambiguous, so no chord is both major and minor.\n\n        But note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's check:\n\n            Notes: ['C#','B','F'] -> [1,10,5]\n\n            Permutations:\n\n            [1,10,5]:\n                d1 = (10-1)%12 = 9 -> not 3 or 4.\n                d2 = (5-10)%12 = (5-10)%12 = -5 %12 = 7 -> no.\n\n            [1,5,10]:\n                d1 = (5-1)%12=4 -> no (we need 3 for minor or 4 for major first part)\n                d2 = (10-5)%12=5 -> no.\n\n            [10,1,5]:\n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10)%12 = -9%12=3 -> then d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor! Yes.\n\n            So we found minor.\n\n        But wait, how did we get (1-10)%12=3? Because (1-10) = -9, and -9 mod12 is 3 (since 12*1 - 9 = 3). So yes.\n\n        However, note: the example ordering was given as \"B C# F\", which corresponds to [10,1,5]. So we found the minor.\n\n        But wait: the example says the chord is minor. So our method works.\n\n        However, let's test the example \"A B H\": [9,10,11]\n\n            Check for major: any permutation with d1=4 and d2=3?\n                [9,10,11]: d1=1, d2=1 -> no.\n                [9,11,10]: d1= (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)%12= (10-11)%12=-1%12=11 -> no.\n                [10,9,11]: d1=(9-10)%12= -1%12=11, d2= (11-9)%12=2 -> no.\n                [10,11,9]: d1= (11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)%12= -2%12=10 -> no.\n                [11,9,10]: d1=(9-11)%12= -2%12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n                [11,10,9]: d1=(10-11)%12= -1%12=11, d2=(9-10)%12= -1%12=11 -> no.\n\n            So it returns \"strange\".\n\n        However, wait: the example output for \"A B H\" is 'strange'. So that matches.\n\n        But note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. In the case of [9,10,11] (A,B,H), the distances are 1 and 1. So it's an augmented chord? \n\n        However, the above method uses the modulus and checks the two consecutive intervals. We are not requiring that the entire set is contained in an octave. \n\n        But wait: the condition for the chord is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). Our method checks the two consecutive intervals in the given permutation. \n\n        One more example: a diminished chord, say [C,E,G#] (which is 0,4,8). \n\n            [0,4,8]: d1=4, d2=4 -> not major or minor.\n            [0,8,4]: d1=8, d2=(4-8)%12= (4-8+12)%12=8 -> no.\n            [4,0,8]: d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(8-0)%12=8 -> no.\n            [4,8,0]: d1=4, d2=(0-8)%12=4 -> no.\n            [8,0,4]: d1=(0-8)%12=4, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n            [8,4,0]: d1=(4-8)%12= (4-8+12)%12=8, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n        So it returns \"strange\".\n\n        This seems to be working.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n            (a-b) %12: if a-b is negative, then it adds 12 until positive.\n\n        But wait: what if the distance is more than 12? Actually, the notes are modulo12, so the maximum distance in the circle is 11. But we are taking modulus 12, so we are reducing the difference to the range [0,11].\n\n        But note: the condition for the chord requires the two consecutive intervals to be 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). These are fixed. \n\n        However, there is a catch: the problem says the chord is defined by the two consecutive intervals. But what if the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3, but the entire set of notes is not contiguous? \n\n        Example: [0,4,7] is major. What about [0,4,7+12]? But we don't have that because we normalized to 0-11.\n\n        But wait, what if the chord spans more than one octave? \n\n        Example: [0,4,19] -> but 19 mod12 = 7, so [0,4,7] again.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input string to three numbers (each note to a number from 0 to 11).\n            Step 2: Generate all permutations of these three numbers.\n            Step 3: For each permutation (x,y,z):\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12   [This will be in [0,11]]\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12   [This will be in [0,11]]\n\n                If d1==4 and d2==3: mark major as found.\n                If d1==3 and d2==4: mark minor as found.\n\n            Step 4: Output accordingly.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a chord that is major but the two intervals are not in the first two consecutive? For example, what if the chord is defined by the intervals (3,4) but then the entire set is not contiguous? Actually, the condition is about the two consecutive intervals. \n\n        But note: the condition is for the entire chord to be three notes, and the two consecutive intervals. The chord must have two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        But wait: the entire chord must be three notes. The condition does not require the entire chord to be within one octave. However, the example \"C E G\" is within one octave. But consider a major chord that wraps:\n\n            Example: [C, E, G] in the next octave? Actually, we normalized to 0-11, so we don't have multiple octaves.\n\n        However, the problem says: the notes are repeated cyclically, so we consider the circle. \n\n        But note: the input gives three notes. They are given without octave information. So we assume they are from the same octave or adjacent? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but the mapping is independent of octave.\n\n        Since the circle is 12, and we map each note to a number from 0 to 11, we are effectively assuming that the three notes are within one octave. \n\n        But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n            C# (1), B (10), F (5). \n\n        This chord is minor. However, if we consider the notes in two octaves, we might have other representations, but the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically, so we are only concerned with the semitone classes.\n\n        Therefore, the mapping is correct.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import itertools\n\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            s = input().strip().split()\n            if len(s) != 3:\n                # According to the problem, there are three notes. But just in case.\n                # But the problem says three, so we assume three.\n                pass\n\n            nums = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n\n            # Generate all permutations\n            perms = set(itertools.permutations(nums))\n\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                x, y, z = p\n                # Calculate the two consecutive intervals\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                # But note: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n                #   However, the modulus in Python for negative numbers: \n                #       (a - b) % 12: if a-b is negative, then it becomes positive by adding 12 until positive.\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n\n            if found_major:\n                print(\"major\")\n            elif found_minor:\n                print(\"minor\")\n            else:\n                print(\"strange\")\n\n        However, wait: the example [10,1,5] (B, C#, F) for minor: \n            We found d1 = (1-10)%12 = 3, d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n        But what if the two intervals are the same but in a different order? For example, what if we have a major chord that is represented by (3,4) in one permutation and (4,3) in another? Actually, the condition is fixed: the first interval must be 4 and the second 3 for major, and vice versa for minor.\n\n        However, note: the problem defines the major chord as having the two intervals (4 and 3) and the minor as (3 and 4). The ordering is fixed by the condition: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n        But in the example [10,1,5]: \n            Ordering: [10,1,5] -> the distances: from 10 to 1 is 3, and from 1 to 5 is 4. So that matches minor.\n\n        But wait: the problem says for minor: \"the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones\". In the ordering [10,1,5], we have:\n            X = 10 (B), Y=1 (C#), Z=5 (F)\n            Then the distance from X to Y is 3, and from Y to Z is 4 -> minor.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example \"C E G\" is [0,4,7] and we found the permutation [0,4,7] which gives d1=4, d2=3 -> major.\n\n        But what if we have a chord that is both? The problem says it's unambiguous.\n\n        One more corner: what if the chord is [0,4,8] (C, E, G#) -> which is not major or minor, but what if we check:\n\n            [0,4,8]: d1=4, d2=4 -> not 4,3 or 3,4 -> strange.\n\n        But wait, is [0,4,8] a major chord? No, because the major chord requires the third interval to be 3 semitones from E to G, but here from E to G# is 4 semitones. So it's an augmented chord.\n\n        So the code should be correct.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n            Expected: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\n        We have:\n\n            Example 1: ['C E G'] -> [0,4,7] -> found major.\n            Example 2: ['C# B F'] -> [1,10,5] -> found minor (via permutation [10,1,5]).\n            Example 3: ['A B H'] -> [9,10,11] -> no permutation gives (4,3) or (3,4) -> strange.\n\n        So the code should work.\n\n        However, note: the example input is given as a string in the format \"C E G\", etc.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: what if the input has the same note repeated? The problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So the input should have three distinct notes.\n\n        We assume distinct.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import itertools\n\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each musical note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11, representing its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, calculate the intervals between consecutive notes. A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second interval to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second interval to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Decision Making**: Based on the intervals found in any permutation, classify the chord as major, minor, or strange (neither).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    perms = set(itertools.permutations(nums))\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in perms:\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique integer (0-11) based on its position in the musical scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding integers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: All possible orderings of the three notes are generated using `itertools.permutations`.\n4. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Chord Classification**: The intervals are checked against the criteria for major (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) and minor (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) chords. If either is found, the result is printed; otherwise, \"strange\" is printed indicating the chord does not fit either category.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
