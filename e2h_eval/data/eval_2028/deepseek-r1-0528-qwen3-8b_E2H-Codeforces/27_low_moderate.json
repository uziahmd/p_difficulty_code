On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence after reversal must be considered. However, note that the reversal operation might change the arrangement of 1's and 2's.\n\n Without any reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence would be the entire set of 1's and then 2's? Actually, we can have multiple increasing runs.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. The goal is to maximize the overall longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n In the original sequence, the entire sequence is composed of two numbers: 1 and 2.\n\n The longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire sequence (without reversal) is at most the total number of elements if the sequence is non-decreasing. But if not, then we can think of it as: \n   - The LNDS is the sum of the consecutive 1's and then consecutive 2's that we can form.\n\n However, after reversal, we can fix a part of the sequence that was originally decreasing (like a run of 2's then 1's) to become increasing.\n\n How can we approach this?\n\n Note: The entire sequence is made of 1's and 2's. Therefore, the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be broken down as:\n\n   Option 1: Take all the 1's and then all the 2's. But wait, if we reverse a segment, we might merge some 1's and 2's in a way that we can include more.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation is contiguous. Let's denote:\n\n   Original sequence: [a1, a2, ..., an]\n\n After reversing [l, r] (0-indexed or 1-indexed?), the sequence becomes:\n   [a1, a2, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_{l}, a_{r+1}, ... , a_n]\n\n What is the effect? The reversal flips a contiguous segment.\n\n Since the sequence is only 1 and 2, we can consider the following:\n\n   The entire sequence can be split into three parts:\n      [prefix] [reversed segment] [suffix]\n\n   The prefix and suffix are unchanged.\n\n   The reversed segment is the original segment [l, r] but reversed.\n\n What is the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the entire sequence?\n\n Since the sequence is only 1 and 2, the LNDS is simply the entire sequence if the entire sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can combine the prefix, reversed segment, and suffix.\n\n However, note: the LNDS doesn't need to be contiguous, but the condition is non-decreasing. So the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but we can pick a mix from the entire sequence.\n\n But note: the problem is asking for the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after performing one reversal.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the array consists only of 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is just the maximum between:\n   - The total number of 1's (if we can arrange to take all 1's without having to leave out some 2's that come after? Actually, no, because we can also take 2's if they are in order.)\n\n Actually, note: we can always take all the 1's and then all the 2's. But wait, the reversal might help by rearranging the 1's and 2's so that we have a longer increasing sequence.\n\n However, the entire sequence after reversal might not be non-decreasing, but the LNDS can be computed by:\n\n   Let x = count of 1's in the entire sequence.\n   Let y = count of 2's in the entire sequence.\n\n   Then, without reversal, the LNDS is min(x+y, max_contiguous_1s + max_contiguous_2s_that_follow_the_1s) ??? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, without reversal, the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. But if not, we can still take all the 1's and then all the 2's? \n\n However, note: the LNDS does not require contiguous elements. But since the array is only 1 and 2, the entire set of 1's and then the entire set of 2's (in order) is always a valid non-decreasing subsequence. Therefore, the LNDS is at least (x+y) if we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's? But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the optimal solution involves flipping a segment where the original sequence has a decreasing pattern (i.e., a block of 2s followed by a block of 1s), which when reversed becomes an increasing sequence (1s followed by 2s). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such a sequence can be the entire sequence if it is already non-decreasing. Otherwise, the LNDS will include all 1s followed by all 2s. However, by reversing a segment, we can potentially merge some 1s and 2s from different parts of the sequence into a single increasing sequence.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal reversal will convert a segment of 2s followed by 1s into 1s followed by 2s. This allows us to combine more 1s and 2s into the LNDS. The goal is to find the segment whose reversal maximizes the combined count of 1s and 2s in the resulting sequence.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We precompute prefix sums of 1s and 2s to efficiently calculate the number of 1s and 2s in any segment. For each possible segment [l, r], we check if reversing it would turn a decreasing segment (2s followed by 1s) into an increasing one (1s followed by 2s). If so, we calculate the potential increase in the LNDS by combining the 1s from the suffix and the 2s from the prefix around the reversed segment.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over all possible segments (O(n^2)), and for each segment, performing constant-time checks and calculations using precomputed prefix sums. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint n ≤ 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(arr)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    ans = n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            left_ones = prefix_ones[i]\n            right_twos = n - prefix_twos[j+1]\n            middle_ones = prefix_ones[j+1] - prefix_ones[i]\n            middle_twos = prefix_twos[j+1] - prefix_twos[i]\n            \n            if middle_twos < middle_ones:\n                total_after_flip = left_ones + middle_ones + right_twos\n                if total_after_flip > ans:\n                    ans = total_after_flip\n                    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.\n2. **Prefix Arrays**: Two prefix arrays are computed: `prefix_ones` counts cumulative 1s up to each index, and `prefix_twos` does the same for 2s.\n3. **Initial Answer**: The initial answer is set to the length of the sequence, assuming the sequence is already non-decreasing.\n4. **Segment Iteration**: For each possible segment [i, j], the code checks if reversing the segment would convert a decreasing sequence (more 2s than 1s) into an increasing one. If so, it calculates the total number of 1s and 2s that can be included in the LNDS by combining the 1s before the segment, the 1s within the segment, and the 2s after the segment.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value obtained from all segments is printed as the result, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequence achievable after one reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments to find the optimal reversal that maximizes the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence, leveraging prefix sums for quick cumulative counts.",
