Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to break the problem into two parts:\n 1. Matching the '?' with specific colors (or other '?') as much as possible, but note that we want maximum pairs and also we have to output the pairs.\n\n However, note: The problem has two types of boots: left and right, each string of length n.\n\n Steps:\n - We cannot use a boot more than once.\n - We have two strings: l (left) and r (right)\n\n We can consider:\n   - First, match the boots that have fixed colors (non '?') and are compatible.\n   - Then, handle the remaining '?' in both strings.\n\n But note: an indefinite color '?' can be matched with any color (even a fixed one or another '?'). However, matching two '?' together is allowed and sometimes necessary if we don't have a fixed color match.\n\n However, the problem is to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n Important: The total pairs cannot exceed n (which is given). We are to output the maximum pairs and the pairs.\n\n Let's think:\n\n We can form a pair from two boots (one left, one right) if:\n   - The left boot color is a letter and the right boot color is the same letter.\n   - The left boot color is '?' and the right boot color is any letter (including '?').\n   - The right boot color is '?' and the left boot color is any letter (including '?').\n\n However, note that the problem says: \n      An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n So, we can also have:\n   - A '?' in left and a '?' in right: that's compatible.\n\n But note: we cannot use a boot twice.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n can be up to 150000, we need an efficient solution.\n\n Observation:\n\n We can first try to match the fixed colors (non '?') that are compatible. Then, for the remaining '?' in both strings, we can form pairs arbitrarily? \n\n However, note: the matching must be one-to-one and we want the maximum.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to bipartite matching, but we are allowed to match if:\n   - l[i] == r[j] (for non '?')\n   - or l[i] == '?' and r[j] is anything (then we can match)\n   - or l[i] is anything and r[j] == '?'\n\n But note: the condition is symmetric in the sense that we can also match two '?' together.\n\n However, the catch: we want maximum pairs.\n\n We can break the problem into two sets:\n\n   Let A = set of indices for left boots that are not '?'\n   Let B = set of indices for right boots that are not '?'\n\n Then, we can match:\n   - All pairs (i, j) such that l[i] == r[j] and i in A and j in B.\n\n   Then, the remaining '?' in left and right can be matched arbitrarily (since they are wildcards). However, note: we might have leftover '?' that we can match with the fixed ones we haven't considered? Actually, no: because fixed ones were already matched by their own color.\n\n But wait: the problem does not require that we use only fixed matches first. In fact, we can use '?' to match with fixed, and fixed with '?', and even two '?' together.\n\n However, the maximum pairs is the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where an edge exists between left index i and right index j if:\n   (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is anything) OR (r[j]=='?' and l[i] is anything).\n\n But note: the condition \"OR\" includes the case when both are '?'. So actually, the condition is always true if at least one is '?' and the other is arbitrary, and also when both are fixed and equal.\n\n However, there is a caveat: if we use a '?' to match a fixed color, then we are using up that '?' which could have been used to match two '?'? But note: we want maximum pairs.\n\n Actually, the problem is that we have two types of edges:\n\n   Type 1: fixed matches (both fixed and equal)\n   Type 2: one fixed and one '?'\n   Type 3: two '?'\n\n But note: the graph is large (n=150000) so we cannot do a general bipartite matching (like Hopcroft–Karp) because that would be too slow.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can separate the boots into two categories:\n\n   Category 1: Boots that are fixed (non '?')\n   Category 2: Boots that are '?'\n\n However, note: the problem allows matching a fixed color with a '?' and vice versa, and also two '?'.\n\n We can think of it as:\n\n   Step 1: Count the maximum matching by considering the fixed boots. We can form a bipartite graph for the fixed boots",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined as follows: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same; an indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching each left boot to a right boot such that their colors are compatible. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs efficiently, given the constraints (n can be up to 150,000). \n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves two main steps:\n   - **Matching Fixed Colors**: First, match all pairs where both boots have fixed colors (non '?') and these colors are identical. This step ensures that we utilize all exact matches without interference from wildcards.\n   - **Handling Wildcards**: After processing fixed color matches, the remaining '?' in both strings can be matched in any order since '?' is compatible with any color. The number of such matches is limited by the minimum of the remaining '?' in left and right boots.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution leverages frequency counting for fixed colors to efficiently find all possible matches. For wildcard characters, a greedy approach is used to match them in any order, ensuring maximum pairs.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the input strings exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    fixed_left = []\n    fixed_right = []\n    q_left = []\n    q_right = []\n    \n    for i, ch in enumerate(l_str):\n        if ch == '?':\n            q_left.append(i)\n        else:\n            fixed_left.append((i, ch))\n            \n    for i, ch in enumerate(r_str):\n        if ch == '?':\n            q_right.append(i)\n        else:\n            fixed_right.append((i, ch))\n            \n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for i, ch in fixed_right:\n        freq[ch] += 1\n        \n    matches = 0\n    \n    for i, ch in fixed_left:\n        if freq.get(ch, 0) > 0:\n            matches += 1\n            freq[ch] -= 1\n            \n    total_matches = matches + min(len(q_left), len(q_right))\n    \n    print(total_matches)\n    \n    res_left = []\n    res_right = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n    \n    for i, ch in fixed_left:\n        if freq.get(ch, 0) > 0:\n            res_left.append(i+1)\n            res_right.append(freq[ch] + 1)\n            freq[ch] -= 1\n            \n    while left_index < len(res_left) and right_index < len(res_right):\n        print(f\"{res_left[left_index]} {res_right[right_index]}\")\n        left_index += 1\n        right_index += 1\n        \n    q_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(q_left)):\n        print(f\"{q_left[i]+1} {q_right[q_count]+1}\")\n        q_count += 1\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Separating Characters**: The code separates the characters into fixed colors and wildcards ('?') for both left and right boots.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: For fixed colors on the right, it counts occurrences to facilitate matching with left boots of the same color.\n4. **Fixed Color Matching**: It matches left boots with fixed colors to right boots of the same color, decrementing the count each time a match is found.\n5. **Wildcard Matching**: The remaining wildcards are matched in any order, as they can pair with any color. The number of such matches is the minimum of the counts of wildcards in left and right boots.\n6. **Output**: The results are printed, first listing the pairs from fixed color matches, followed by pairs from wildcard matches.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by prioritizing exact matches and then utilizing wildcards, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
