            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. Each string is of the form \"digit suit\", but note: the input is three space separated strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the problem says: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n However, looking at the example, it seems that each tile is represented by two characters (like '1s') and there are three tiles. So the input line has three tokens, each token being two characters.\n\n Example: \"1s 2s 3s\" — that would be three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s'\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is shown as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This might be just for illustration. The actual input is one line with three strings? Or three tokens?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n And each tile is represented as a string of two characters.\n\n So the input line will have three such strings. Example: \"1s2s3s\" would be if they were concatenated? But no, the example input format is shown as:\n\n   Input: \n      ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n Actually, the example output is:\n\n      ['0', '0', '1']\n\n And the third example input is \"3p 9m 2p\", meaning three tiles: \"3p\", \"9m\", \"2p\".\n\n But wait, the input is one line containing three strings? Or three tokens?\n\n Clarification from the problem: \"The only line contains three strings\". \n\n In competitive programming, sometimes the input is given as a single line with multiple space-separated tokens. However, the example representation is confusing.\n\n Since the problem says \"three strings\", and the example shows three strings (each being a two-character string) then we can assume:\n\n   We read one line, split it, and we get a list of three strings.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n   \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n   \"9m 9m 9m\"\n\n   \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n However, the problem says the input is one line. So actually, the example input is given as three separate lines? \n\n Let me check the problem statement: \"The only line\" — meaning one line. \n\n Then the example input must be:\n\n   Line 1: \"1s 2s 3s\"   (but wait, that's three tokens)\n\n Actually, the example input format in the problem is ambiguous. But looking at the example outputs, they are printed as:\n\n   Output: ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So the program should output three integers? Or one integer per test case? \n\n Wait, the example input is provided as three separate examples. The problem says:\n\n   Input: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n   Output:\n        ['0', '0', '1']\n\n But the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the problem. \n\n Actually, the example input is just three test cases. However, the problem states: \"The only line\" — meaning one line of input.\n\n After reading the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n This means that the entire input is one line, which contains three strings (each representing a tile). \n\n But wait, if we have three tiles, each represented by two characters, then the total length is 6 or 7? Because the tile is two characters, so three tiles would be 6 characters. But the problem says \"three strings\", meaning three tokens? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the only line contains three strings\", so the input is one line with three strings. Then we split the line by space? But the example: \"1s 2s 3s\" — that would be one line with three tokens: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\n However, what if the input is given without spaces? The problem does not specify. But the example includes spaces.\n\n Let me see: \"Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from 1 to 9). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit\"\n\n So each tile is represented as a string of length 2. And the input line has three such strings. \n\n Therefore, the input line will have three two-character tokens. We can split the line by space.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read a line and split into tokens. There should be exactly three tokens.\n\n 2. For each token, we can break it into the digit part and the suit part. But note: each token is two characters, so the first character is the digit and the second is the suit.\n\n 3. We have three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n What are the possibilities?\n\n Case 0: Already a mentsu? Then 0.\n\n Case 1: Not yet, but can we form a mentsu by drawing 1 tile?\n\n Case 2: Drawing 2 tiles?\n\n Case 3: Even after drawing 2 tiles, we cannot form a mentsu? Then we need 3? \n\n But note: we have three tiles initially. We can draw more. We are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily many times.\n\n However, note that a mentsu is defined as either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\n Let's consider:\n\n Option 1: Triplet (koutsu)\n   We need three identical tiles. The current hand has three tiles. They might be:\n     - Already three same: then 0.\n     - Two same and one different: then we can draw the missing one to make three same -> 1.\n     - One same and two different: then we need two more of the same -> 2.\n     - All different: then we need at least two more (if we want to form a triplet for one of the numbers) but wait, we can choose any tile. However, note: we are forming one mentsu. So we can focus on one number. We can draw two of the same number (if that number appears once) to form a triplet. But also, if there are two different numbers, we can't form a triplet for both at the same time with only two draws? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n   However, note: the triplet must be of the same tile (same suit and same number). So if we have [1m, 1m, 2m] then we can draw one 1m to get [1m,1m,1m,2m] and then we have a triplet (and an extra tile). So that's 1 draw.\n\n   But if we have [1m, 2m, 3m] and we want to form a triplet, we can draw two more 1m, or two more 2m, or two more 3m. Then we have a triplet and two extra tiles. However, we might also form a shuntsu.\n\n   Actually, we are allowed to form any mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu). So we have two types to consider.\n\n Option 2: Sequence (shuntsu)\n   A shuntsu requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   We can have:\n     - Already a shuntsu: e.g., [1m,2m,3m] -> 0.\n     - How about two consecutive with one missing? For example, [1m,2m,4m]: we can draw a 3m to complete the sequence -> 1.\n     - Also, we can have non-consecutive ones that can form a sequence with two draws? For example, [1m,3m,4m]: we can draw a 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m] or [2m,3m,4m]? But wait, [1m,3m,4m] already has two consecutive (3m,4m). Then we can draw a 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m] OR a 1m to complete [2m,3m,4m] (but wait, we don't have two 3m and 4m? Actually, we have one 3m and one 4m. Then if we draw 2m, we have [1m,2m,3m,3m,4m] and then we can take [1m,2m,3m] as a sequence. Similarly, if we draw 2m again, we don't have enough for two sequences? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. We can choose which one to form.\n\n   Also, we might have two different suits. Then we cannot form a sequence because sequences require same suit.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's denote:\n     hand = [t1, t2, t3]\n\n   We can count the frequency of each tile (by suit and number).\n\n   We need to consider:\n\n   Possibility 1: Already have a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) -> 0.\n\n   Possibility 2: With one draw, can we form a mentsu?\n        a) Koutsu: \n            For a particular tile (say, x), if we have two or more of x, then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more x. But wait, we have three tiles. If we have two of the same, then the third is different. So we can complete the triplet for that same one by drawing one. But note: the other tile is still there. However, the definition of mentsu is just having at least one mentsu. Having a triplet and one extra tile is acceptable.\n\n            Alternatively, we might have three tiles of different numbers, but we can choose one number and draw two of them? But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile. So for koutsu, we can only complete a triplet if we have two of a kind.\n\n        b) Shuntsu:\n            We need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. We can have two tiles that are consecutive (same suit, and numbers n and n+1) and then we can draw n+2 (or n-1 if we have n and n+1 and n+2 isn't available, but wait: we are allowed to draw any tile, so we can always draw the next one). \n\n            But note: we have three tiles. We can use two of them to form a base for a sequence. For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 4m], then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (and leave 4m). \n\n            However, what if we have [1m, 1m, 2m]? Then we have two 1m and one 2m. We can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m. But note: we have two 1m, so we can use one of them for the sequence and the other is left. That is acceptable.\n\n            Also, we might have a sequence that uses two different pairs? Actually, we have three tiles. We can use at most three.\n\n            Conditions for one-draw shuntsu:\n                - There exists a suit and a starting number n (from 1 to 7) such that we have two of the three consecutive tiles (n, n+1, n+2) in that suit. And the missing one is the only one needed.\n\n            But note: we might have duplicates. For example, [1m, 2m, 2m]. Then we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m. But we also have an extra 2m. Alternatively, we could also form a triplet of 2m (if we draw one more 2m) but that is koutsu. However, we are considering one-draw and we can do either.\n\n            Actually, we are to compute the minimum number of draws. So we should check both koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n   Possibility 3: With two draws, can we form a mentsu?\n        a) Koutsu: \n            - If we have one of a kind, then we need to draw two of that same tile.\n\n            - But note: we might have two different numbers that we can form triplets for, but we can only form one mentsu. So we choose the one that requires two draws.\n\n            - However, we might also consider that we can form a triplet by drawing two of a tile that appears once.\n\n        b) Shuntsu:\n            - We might have two tiles that are one apart, but we need two more (for example, [1m, 3m, 5m] in the same suit). Then we can draw 2m and 4m? But wait, we only need one mentsu. Actually, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles: for example, [1m, 2m, 3m] by drawing 2m and 3m? But wait, we have 1m and 3m, so we can draw 2m to get [1m,2m,3m] and then we have the original 1m,3m and the drawn 2m. But wait, we have two 1m? No, we have one 1m and one 3m. Then we draw 2m: that gives us [1m, 3m, 5m, 2m]. Now we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using the drawn 2m). So that's one draw? Actually, no: we drew one tile (2m) and now we have four tiles. But the condition is that we need to form at least one mentsu. We are allowed to have extra tiles.\n\n            Actually, the problem does not require to use all the tiles, just to have at least one mentsu.\n\n            However, note: we start with three tiles, and we can draw up to two. After drawing two, we have five. But we don't have to use all, we just need to have a mentsu (any three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu) somewhere.\n\n            But wait, the rules of the game? The problem doesn't specify the entire set of rules, but the goal is to have at least one mentsu.\n\n            How about: [1m, 1m, 1m] is a mentsu (koutsu). Similarly, [1m,2m,3m] is a mentsu (shuntsu). \n\n            However, note that we can have duplicate tiles. The definition of koutsu requires three identical tiles. So having four 1m is okay, because we can pick three of them to form a koutsu.\n\n            So for shuntsu, we can use any three consecutive in the same suit, even if there are duplicates? Actually, the definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. It doesn't say distinct tiles. But wait, the example: [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains [5p, 4p, 6p] as a shuntsu? Actually, wait, the example says [5p, 4p, 6p] is a shuntsu? But 4,5,6 are consecutive. However, the example input has two 7p and two 5p? But the example output says it contains a shuntsu.\n\n            Actually, the example input is: [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — and the shuntsu is [5p, 4p, 6p] (which is not sorted, but that's okay because order doesn't matter). But wait, the example says: \"it contains a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p]\" — wait, [5p, 7p, 6p] is [5,7,6] which is consecutive? Actually, 5,6,7 are consecutive. So they are using two different sequences.\n\n            So duplicates are allowed? Actually, the shuntsu requires three distinct numbers? The example [5p,4p,6p] uses 4,5,6 (distinct) and [5p,7p,6p] uses 5,6,7 (distinct). \n\n            But wait, what if we have [1m,2m,2m,3m] — then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using one of the 2m). \n\n            Therefore, for shuntsu, we can have duplicates, but the three tiles must be distinct in number? Actually, the definition says \"three sequential numbered tiles\". So the numbers must be consecutive and distinct. \n\n            So for shuntsu, the three tiles must be three distinct consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n   We have three tiles. We can represent the hand as a list of (number, suit). \n\n   Step 1: Check if there's already a mentsu.\n\n   Step 2: Check if one draw can form a mentsu.\n\n   Step 3: Check if two draws can form a mentsu.\n\n   Step 4: Otherwise, we need three draws? Actually, wait: the problem says minimum number. But note:\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 1m] -> 0.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> 1 (because we can form a triplet of 1m by drawing one 1m, OR a shuntsu? [1m,1m,2m] is not a shuntsu because we need three consecutive. But wait, we can form a triplet. So 1.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> 0.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> 1 (shuntsu: draw 3m).\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 3m] -> \n            Already: no triplet (only two 1m) and no shuntsu (we have 1,1,3 -> not consecutive).\n            One draw: \n                For koutsu: we can draw one 1m to complete the triplet (then we have three 1m and one 3m) -> valid, so 1.\n                Also, for shuntsu: we can draw a 2m to form [1m,2m,3m] (using one of the 1m and the 3m and the drawn 2m) -> valid, so 1.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 4m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw 1m -> then we have three 1m and one 4m -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: we can form a shuntsu with [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m? But wait, we are only allowed one draw. So we can only draw one. Then we can't form a shuntsu in one draw. Alternatively, we can form [3m,4m,5m] by drawing 5m? But wait, we have 1m,1m,4m. We can use the 4m and then we need 3m and 5m? But one draw only one tile. So no.\n\n            So one draw is sufficient for koutsu.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> 1 (as above)\n\n        Example: [1m, 3m, 4m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: we don't have two of any -> so no.\n                Shuntsu: we have 3m and 4m. We can draw 2m to form [2m,3m,4m] (using the existing 3m and 4m and the drawn 2m). So 1.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 2m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw one 2m to complete [2m,2m,2m] -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (using one 2m) -> valid.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2p] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw 1m -> then we have three 1m and one 2p -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: we have two 1m (suit m) and one 2p (suit p). We cannot form a shuntsu because shuntsu requires same suit. So only koutsu is available.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 3p] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw 1m -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: same suit? no, because 1m and 3p are different suits. So we cannot form a shuntsu.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 5m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw 1m -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: we have 1m and 5m. We can form a shuntsu by drawing three tiles? But one draw only. We can form a shuntsu that uses 1m? Then we need 2m and 3m, but that's two draws. So one draw is not enough for shuntsu.\n\n        Example: [1m, 5m, 9m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: no two same.\n                Shuntsu: no two consecutive in the same suit.\n\n        Example: [1m, 5m, 9m] -> two draws: \n            For koutsu: we can draw two 1m, or two 5m, or two 9m. Then we have a triplet. So two draws.\n            For shuntsu: we can try to form a sequence with two draws. But note: we have three different numbers. We can form a sequence by completing one of the gaps. However, we need three consecutive. The numbers are 1,5,9. We can form a sequence by drawing two tiles to complete one of the possible sequences? For example, if we draw 2m and 3m, then we have [1m,2m,3m] and the rest [5m,9m]. So two draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 5m, 9m] -> two draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 5m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw one 1m -> valid (then we have three 1m and one 5m) -> 1.\n                Shuntsu: we have 1m and 5m. We can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing two 2m and 3m? But that's two draws. Alternatively, we can form [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 4m and 6m? Then we have [1m,1m,5m,4m,6m] and then we can use [4m,5m,6m] (shuntsu). But that's two draws.\n\n            So minimum is 1 (koutsu).\n\n        Example: [1m, 5m, 5m] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: draw one 5m -> valid.\n                Shuntsu: we have 5m and 5m. We can form a sequence? We need three consecutive. We can use the two 5m and one 4m and one 6m? But that's two draws. Or we can use the two 5m and one 4m to form [4m,5m,5m] -> but wait, shuntsu requires three distinct consecutive numbers. So we need one 4m, one 5m, one 6m. We have two 5m, so we can use one 5m. Then we need to draw 4m and 6m (two draws). \n\n            So one draw is enough for koutsu.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4p] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: no two same.\n                Shuntsu: we have 1m,2m (same suit) but then 4p is different. We can form a shuntsu in the m suit? We have 1m and 2m, then we need 3m. But the 4p is in a different suit. So we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (shuntsu). So 1.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4p] -> 1.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4s] -> same as above.\n\n        Example: [1m, 3m, 4s] -> \n            Already: no.\n            One draw: \n                Koutsu: no two same.\n                Shuntsu: we have 3m and 4s (different suits) -> cannot form a shuntsu in one draw because we need same suit. So no.\n\n        Example: [1m, 3m, 4s] -> \n            Two draws: \n                We can form a triplet for 1m? We need two more 1m -> two draws.\n                Or for 3m? We need two more 3m -> two draws.\n                Or for 4s? two more 4s -> two draws.\n                Or form a shuntsu: we can form a shuntsu in m: [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m (one draw) and then we have [1m,2m,3m] (shuntsu). But wait, we only drew one tile (2m) and then we have [1m,2m,3m] (using the 1m and 3m and the drawn 2m). But wait, the hand is [1m,3m,4s] and we draw 2m -> then we have [1m,3m,4s,2m]. Then we can form the shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4s). So that's one draw.\n\n            But wait, I thought one draw was not enough because of the suit mismatch. But actually, the 2m is drawn and then we have two m tiles (1m and 2m and 3m) and one s tile (4s). So yes, we have a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] in the m suit.\n\n            Correction: The example [1m, 3m, 4s] -> we can form a shuntsu by drawing one 2m. So one draw.\n\n        So why did I think we couldn't? Because the hand originally has 1m and 3m (suit m) and 4s (suit s). After drawing 2m, we have 1m,2m,3m (all m) and 4s. Then we have a shuntsu in m. \n\n        Therefore, we must consider that we can mix the existing tiles arbitrarily (as long as the drawn tile is of the same suit as the two we are using for the shuntsu). \n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Let tiles = [t1, t2, t3] where each ti is a string of two chars.\n\n        We can represent each tile as (int(tile[0]), tile[1])\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Check if there's already a mentsu.\n\n           Check for koutsu: \n                Count the frequency of each tile (by both number and suit). If any tile appears at least 3 times, then we have a triplet. But we have only three tiles. So if we have three identical, then yes.\n\n                However, note: koutsu is three identical, so same suit and same number.\n\n           Check for shuntsu:\n                Group by suit. For each suit, consider the distinct numbers (and ignore duplicates for the purpose of forming a sequence? Actually, we can use duplicates to form the sequence? No, because the sequence requires three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n                But wait, we can use one tile only once. So we need three distinct tiles (same suit, consecutive numbers) in the hand. However, if we have duplicates, we can still use one occurrence for the sequence.\n\n                Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> we can form [1m,2m,?] but we need 3m. But wait, we don't have 3m. However, we can use the two 1m to help two different sequences? Actually, we are allowed to use each tile only once. So in [1m,1m,2m] we have two 1m and one 2m.\n\n                How to check for shuntsu in the hand?\n                    For each suit, collect the numbers. Then sort the distinct numbers (but we can have duplicates, but for the sequence we only need one occurrence of each number).\n\n                Actually, we don't need distinct numbers: we need to check if there exists three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) such that for each of these numbers, we have at least one tile in that suit.\n\n                However, if we have [1m,2m,2m,3m] (four tiles) then we have two 2m, but that doesn't break the sequence.\n\n                Since we have three tiles, we can check:\n\n                    For each suit, let S = sorted(set(numbers in that suit))   [but wait, we can use duplicates? Actually, the definition: three sequential numbered tiles. Each tile is one numbered tile. So we need three distinct numbers? \n\n                    But the example [5p,4p,6p] is three distinct numbers.\n\n                    However, the example [5p,5s,9m,4p,1s,7p,7m,6p] has a shuntsu [5p,4p,6p] — here the numbers are 4,5,6 (distinct). \n\n                    So we need three distinct numbers.\n\n                Therefore, for a given suit, we need at least three distinct numbers that are consecutive.\n\n                But wait, what if we have [1m,2m,3m,3m] (four tiles)? Then we have two 3m. We can use one 3m and one 1m and one 2m to form the sequence.\n\n                However, our hand is three tiles. So we have three tiles. We can only use three.\n\n                So for shuntsu: we need three distinct consecutive numbers in the same suit, and we have at least one tile for each of these numbers (and we don't care about duplicates beyond one).\n\n        2. Check for one-draw mentsu:\n\n            a) Koutsu: \n                For each distinct tile type (suit and number) that appears at least once, if we have two of them, then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more. But note: if we have two of a tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives three.\n\n                However, we can also consider: if we have one tile, we can draw two to complete a triplet, but that's two draws. So for one-draw, we require having two of the same.\n\n                But wait: what if we have three tiles: two of one and one of another. Then we can complete the triplet for the one we have two of.\n\n            b) Shuntsu:\n                We can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile if there exists a suit and a number n such that we have two of the three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) in that suit, and the missing one is n, n+1, or n+2.\n\n                More precisely: \n                    For a fixed suit, consider the set of numbers we have. We need to check if there exists a base number n (from 1 to 7) such that two of the numbers {n, n+1, n+2} are present in the hand (in that suit) and the missing one is the only one we need to draw.\n\n                But note: the hand may have multiple suits. We can only consider one suit at a time.\n\n                Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we have two consecutive (1,2) and missing 3. So we can draw 3m.\n\n                Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> we have two consecutive (3,4) and missing 2. So we can draw 2m.\n\n                Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> we have two 1m and one 2m. Then in suit m, the distinct numbers are {1,2}. We need to check for sequences that include 1 and 2: \n                    Base n=1: [1,2,3] -> we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> can draw 3m.\n                    Base n=0: not allowed (minimum 1)\n                    Base n=2: [2,3,4] -> we have 2, missing 3 and 4 -> but we only draw one, so we can only complete one gap.\n\n                But note: we can only draw one tile. So we can only complete one gap.\n\n                However, we might have two gaps? Actually, we are allowed to form a shuntsu by drawing one tile. We can choose any tile. So we look for any suit and any base n such that two of the three numbers are present and the missing one is not present.\n\n                But what if the hand has tiles from multiple suits? Then we can only use the tiles from one suit.\n\n                Example: [1m, 2m, 3p] -> \n                    In suit m: we have [1,2] (so we can draw 3m to form [1,2,3] in m).\n                    In suit p: we have [3] -> no two consecutive.\n\n                So one-draw shuntsu is possible.\n\n            However, note: we might have two different suits and we can form a shuntsu in one of them.\n\n        3. Check for two-draw mentsu:\n\n            a) Koutsu: \n                For any tile type (suit and number) that appears at least once, we can complete the triplet by drawing two of that tile. So if there is at least one tile that appears at least once, then we can do it in two draws.\n\n            b) Shuntsu:\n                We can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles if there exists a suit and a base n (from 1 to 7) such that one of the three consecutive numbers is present and the other two are missing. Then we draw the two missing ones.\n\n                But wait: we might also have two consecutive numbers and then we need two draws to complete the sequence? Actually, we already considered one-draw for the case when two are present. Now, if only one is present, then we need two draws.\n\n                Example: [1m, 5m] (but wait, we have three tiles. Actually, the hand is three tiles. So let's consider [1m, 5m, 9m] (three tiles, all m). \n                    We have distinct numbers: {1,5,9}. We can form a sequence by drawing two tiles: for example, draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we have 1m,5m,9m, so we can use the 1m and then draw 2m,3m). Or draw 4m,5m,6m? Actually, we have 5m, so we can form [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 4m and 6m.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to use the existing tile (5m) for the sequence [4m,5m,6m]. So we can form that by drawing two tiles.\n\n                However, we might have a hand that doesn't have three tiles of the same suit. Example: [1m, 1p, 5m] -> \n                    In m: [1,5] -> we can form",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same suit and number).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The solution involves checking the initial hand for existing mentsu, then determining if one or two additional tiles can form a mentsu.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, verify if the hand already contains a koutsu or shuntsu.\n   - **One-Draw Check**: Determine if drawing one tile can complete a koutsu (two tiles of the same kind) or a shuntsu (two of three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n   - **Two-Draw Check**: If no one-draw solution exists, check if two tiles can complete a koutsu (one tile duplicated) or a shuntsu (the missing number in a sequence).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Count**: Track the count of each tile (suit and number) to check for koutsu.\n   - **Sequence Check**: For each suit, sort the numbers and check for any three consecutive numbers to form a shuntsu.\n   - **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where tiles are from different suits or numbers are non-consecutive.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves iterating through the tiles and checking possible sequences, which is efficient with a constant time complexity O(1) due to fixed input size (three tiles).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = []\n    for s in data:\n        if len(s) != 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n        tiles.append((int(s[0]), s[1]))\n        \n    def has_koutsu(tiles):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n        for num, suit in tiles:\n            count_dict[(num, suit)] += 1\n            \n        for key in count_dict:\n            if count_dict[key] >= 3:\n                return True\n        return False\n        \n    def has_shuntsu(tiles):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        suit_dict = defaultdict(set)\n        for num, suit in tiles:\n            suit_dict[suit].add(num)\n            \n        for suit, nums_set in suit_dict.items():\n            nums = sorted(nums_set)\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n < 3:\n                continue\n            nums_sorted = sorted(set(nums))\n            for i in range(len(nums_sorted) - 2):\n                if nums_sorted[i+1] == nums_sorted[i] + 1 and nums_sorted[i+2] == nums_sorted[i] + 2:\n                    return True\n            for i in range(len(nums_sorted) - 2):\n                a, b, c = nums_sorted[i], nums_sorted[i]+1, nums_sorted[i]+2\n                if a in nums_set and b in nums_set and c in nums_set:\n                    return True\n        return False\n        \n    if has_koutsu(tiles) or has_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    def one_draw_koutsu(tiles):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n        for num, suit in tiles:\n            count_dict[(num, suit)] += 1\n            \n        for key in count_dict:\n            if count_dict[key] >= 2:\n                return True\n        return False\n        \n    def one_draw_shuntsu(tiles):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        suit_dict = defaultdict(set)\n        for num, suit in tiles:\n            suit_dict[suit].add(num)\n            \n        for suit, nums_set in suit_dict.items():\n            nums = sorted(nums_set)\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n < 2:\n                continue\n            for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n                a = nums[i]\n                b = nums[i+1]\n                if b == a + 1:\n                    needed = b + 1\n                    if needed <= 9:\n                        return True\n                else:\n                    if a + 1 in nums_set and a + 2 in nums_set:\n                        return True\n        return False\n        \n    if one_draw_koutsu(tiles) or one_draw_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    print(2)\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into three tiles.
