    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = (a+k, b+k) be the greatest common divisor. Then note that d divides (a+k) and (b+k), so it must also divide (a+k - (b+k)) = a-b (if a>=b) or (b+k - (a+k)) = b-a (if b>=a). Therefore, d divides |a-b|.\n\n Also, note that for fixed k, we have:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / GCD(a+k, b+k)\n\n We can let g = GCD(a+k, b+k). Then g divides |a-b|, as argued.\n\n So, we can consider divisors of |a-b|. However, note that if a==b, then we are looking for k such that LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k, so the minimum would be at k=0 (then LCM is a, which is minimal).\n\n But note: the problem says \"non-negative integer k\", and we want the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. If multiple k give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If a == b, then we can set k=0 and output 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, let d0 = |a-b| (but note: we are going to consider divisors of d0). However, note that k might also be chosen arbitrarily, but the key is that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide d0.\n\n 3. We note that the condition for k is that (a+k) mod g == 0 and (b+k) mod g == 0, which implies that k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. Since g divides d0, and note that a mod g and b mod g must be the same? Actually, because g divides (a-b), we have a ≡ b (mod g). So the conditions are consistent: we require k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g, and since a ≡ b (mod g), then -a ≡ -b (mod g). So the system has a solution.\n\n    The smallest non-negative k that satisfies k ≡ (-a) mod g is k = (g - a % g) % g, but note: if a % g == 0 then k=0, else k = g - (a % g). However, wait: we also have the condition that k must be non-negative and the same for both a+k and b+k. But note that the system requires k to satisfy:\n        k >= -min(a,b)   [but k>=0] and k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: we require that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then k must be at least max( ceil((-a)/g)*g + something? ) Actually, we can write:\n        k >= max( -a % g, -b % g )? \n\n    But note: k must be non-negative. And we know that the smallest k that makes g divide (a+k) is:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n        However, if a % g != 0, then k0 = g - (a % g) (unless a % g == 0 then k0=0). Similarly for b: k1 = (g - b % g) % g.\n\n    But note: because g divides (a-b), we have a ≡ b (mod g). Therefore, a % g = b % g. So k0 = k1. So for each divisor g of d0, the minimal k that satisfies the congruence for g is k0 = (g - a % g) % g. However, note: we can have k0 negative? No, because modulo operation for positive g and a gives a remainder in [0, g-1]. Then k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g. But if a % g == 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g). However, note that this k0 is the smallest non-negative k that makes a+k divisible by g? Actually, yes.\n\n 4. However, note: the problem does not require the gcd to be g, but the gcd could be any divisor of d0. But the LCM is determined by the gcd. Specifically, for a fixed g (divisor of d0) we can achieve having gcd = g, but note: the actual gcd of (a+k, b+k) might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd must divide d0, but we are considering all divisors. However, note that when we set k0 (the minimal k for g) then the gcd might be greater than g. In fact, the gcd might be a multiple of g. But note: the gcd must divide d0, and d0 is fixed. However, the minimal k for g might not yield an LCM with gcd exactly g, but we are only concerned with the value of the LCM.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We note that the LCM for k is LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / GCD(a+k, b+k). Since GCD(a+k, b+k) = GCD(a+k, |a-b|) [because GCD(a+k, b+k) = GCD(a+k, (a+k)-(b+k)) = GCD(a+k, a-b)], we can write:\n\n   Let d = |a-b|\n   Then, for a candidate k, let g = GCD(a+k, d). Then LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) // g.\n\n But note: the LCM depends on k and the gcd. We are to minimize the LCM.\n\n How to iterate?\n\n We cannot iterate over all k from 0 to ... because k can be very large.\n\n However, note that the gcd g must divide d. Therefore, we can consider all divisors of d (which are at most around 1344 for numbers up to 10^9) and then for each divisor g, we compute the minimal k0 (as above) that makes g divide (a+k) (and hence (b+k) as well, because g divides d). Then, for that k0, we can compute the LCM and compare.\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Because the gcd might not be exactly g, but a multiple of g? Actually, the gcd will be the GCD(a+k0, d). However, note that we set k0 so that g divides (a+k0). But note: the gcd we get is GCD(a+k0, d) and this must be a divisor of d, and also a multiple of g? Actually, no: g divides d and g divides (a+k0), so the gcd (which is GCD(a+k0, d)) must be a divisor of d and also a divisor of a+k0. Moreover, the gcd might be larger than g. However, we are iterating over all divisors of d. So we can also consider the divisors that are multiples of g? But note: the minimal k for a divisor g might not be the one that gives the minimal LCM. Alternatively, we can consider that the actual gcd (let's call it g') must be a divisor of d. Therefore, we can consider every divisor of d (positive) and then for each divisor g', we can compute the minimal k0 for which g' divides (a+k) (and hence (b+k)) and then compute the LCM.\n\n However, note: the minimal k for g' is k0(g') = (g' - a % g') % g'. Then, we can compute the LCM for that k0 and for the divisor g' (which is the actual gcd? Not necessarily, because the gcd is GCD(a+k0, d) and that might be a divisor of d and also divides a+k0, but note: we set k0 so that g' divides a+k0, but the gcd might be a divisor of d that is greater than or equal to g'? Actually, the gcd is the GCD(a+k0, d). Since g' divides a+k0 and g' divides d (because g' is a divisor of d), then the gcd must be at least g'? Actually, no: the gcd is the GCD(a+k0, d) and since g' divides a+k0 and g' divides d, then the gcd is at least g'. But note: we are iterating over all divisors, including the ones that are factors. However, the minimal k for a divisor g' might not be the one that yields the minimal LCM for the divisor g'. But note: we are forced to consider that the gcd must be a divisor of d. So we can iterate over all divisors g' of d, and then for each divisor, compute the minimal k0 that satisfies the condition for g', then compute the LCM for that k0 (with the actual gcd being g_actual = GCD(a+k0, d) [which is at least g']? Actually, wait: we set k0 so that g' divides a+k0. Then the gcd (GCD(a+k0, d)) will be at least g', but it might be a multiple of g' (if there is a common divisor larger than g'). However, note that g' is a divisor of d, and we are iterating over all divisors. Then, when we consider a divisor g', we are effectively requiring that the gcd is divisible by g'. But the actual gcd might be different.\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n   Let g = GCD(a+k, b+k) = GCD(a+k, |a-b|) = GCD(a+k, d)\n\n   Then, g must divide d. So we can iterate over all divisors g of d.\n\n   For each divisor g, we can compute the minimal non-negative k0 (>=0) such that g divides (a+k0). Then, for that k0, the gcd is at least g. However, the LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0)//g0, where g0 = GCD(a+k0, d). But note: g0 might be larger than g. How do we account for that?\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n   Consider that the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)//GCD(a+k, b+k). Since GCD(a+k, b+k) = GCD(a+k, d) (because (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b, and GCD(x,y)=GCD(x, x-y)), then:\n\n        LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) // GCD(a+k, d)\n\n   Now, note that GCD(a+k, d) is the same as GCD(a+k, |a-b|). We are free to choose k. We want to minimize the LCM.\n\n   Also note: k must be chosen so that the gcd is as large as possible to minimize the LCM? Actually, the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k) divided by the gcd. So to minimize the LCM, we want the gcd to be as large as possible (so that the denominator is large) and (a+k)*(b+k) to be as small as possible. But note: (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k (if k increases, both factors increase). However, the gcd might change.\n\n   However, note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. We cannot iterate over all k because k can be very large.\n\n   Another known approach for such problems is to note that the candidate k values are the divisors of d (or related to them) and also the divisors of d might lead to the minimal LCM. But note: the minimal k for divisor g is k0 = (g - a % g) % g. Then, we can compute the LCM for that k0 and also for other k's that are multiples? Actually, we can consider that the condition for k is that k ≡ (-a) mod g. Then the next k's are k0 + t * g (for t>=0). However, we are interested in the smallest k that minimizes the LCM.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, choose the smallest one.\" So we are to consider the smallest k first, and then check the LCM.\n\n   However, note that the minimal k for divisor g is k0, and the next one is k0+g, then k0+2g, etc. But the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)//gcd, and (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k. Therefore, the minimal LCM for a fixed divisor g might occur at the minimal k (k0) because if we take a larger k (k0 + t*g) then the product (a+k)*(b+k) becomes larger.\n\n   BUT: wait, what if the gcd increases when we take a larger k? Then the LCM might become smaller even though the product is larger. Example: \n        a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors of 4: 1,2,4.\n        For g=4: k0 = (4 - 6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4 = 2. Then, a+k=8, b+k=12, gcd=GCD(8,12)=4 -> LCM= (8*12)//4 = 24.\n        Now, if we take k0+4 = 6, then a+k=12, b+k=16, gcd=GCD(12,16)=4 -> LCM=(12*16)//4 = 48, which is worse.\n\n        For g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2 = 0. Then, a+0=6, b+0=10, gcd=GCD(6,10)=2 -> LCM= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n\n        For g=1: k0 = (1-6%1)%1. But note: modulo 1: 6%1=0, so k0=0. Then, gcd=GCD(6,10)=1 -> LCM=60.\n\n        So the minimal LCM is 24 at k=2.\n\n   However, note: the divisor g=4 is the best, but we also have divisor g=2 and g=1. But we found k0 for each divisor. But note: the divisor g=4 leads to the minimal LCM, and k0=2.\n\n   But wait: what if we consider k=2 and k=6? We found k=2 is the minimal k that gives the divisor condition for g=4. However, is there a divisor we haven't considered? What if the gcd is 4, but we get k0=2, and then we don't need to consider k=6 because the LCM increased. But what about divisors that are not factors of d? We are only considering divisors of d.\n\n   However, note: the gcd must divide d, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n   But there is a catch: the minimal k might come from a divisor that is not the actual gcd. Actually, the actual gcd is the GCD(a+k, d) and that is always a divisor of d. So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. For example, if k0=0, then for every divisor g that divides both a and b (since then a%g==0 and b%g==0) we will get k0=0. But then we are going to compute the LCM for k=0 multiple times. We can avoid that by collecting distinct k's and then for each k we compute the LCM.\n\n   But note: the problem says to choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So we should consider all divisors and then among the candidate k's (each divisor gives one candidate k0) we also have to consider that sometimes a divisor might not be the actual gcd, but the k0 is the same for multiple divisors. However, the minimal k for a divisor g is k0 = (g - a % g) % g. This k0 might be the same for different divisors? For example, if two divisors g1 and g2 yield the same k0, then we are effectively testing the same k.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n     Step 1: If a == b, output 0.\n\n     Step 2: Let d = abs(a-b). Find all divisors of d.\n\n     Step 3: For each divisor g of d (both positive divisors), compute k0 = (g - a % g) % g. But note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g). However, note: we are considering positive divisors and k0 is non-negative.\n\n     Step 4: Additionally, note that k0 must satisfy the condition for the divisor g, but note: the gcd we use in the LCM is actually GCD(a+k0, d). However, we don't know the gcd until we compute it. But wait, we can compute the LCM for k0 as (a+k0)*(b+k0) // GCD(a+k0, d). But note: we are iterating over divisors, and we are getting a candidate k0 for each divisor. However, the same k0 might appear for multiple divisors.\n\n     Step 5: We must consider that k0 must be non-negative and we are only interested in the smallest k that minimizes the LCM.\n\n     However, note: the set of candidate k's is the set { (g - a % g) % g for each divisor g of d }.\n\n     But wait: is that all? There is another possibility: k=0 is always a candidate, and also k might be negative? No, k>=0.\n\n     However, note: what if the minimal k is not obtained by one of these divisors? Actually, the gcd must divide d, so the condition for k is that the gcd divides d, and the minimal k for making the gcd at least g is k0. But note: the gcd we get might be a divisor of d, but we are iterating over all divisors. However, the minimal k that gives a particular gcd (say h) is the same as the minimal k that makes h divide (a+k) (and h divides d). Therefore, we are covering all candidates.\n\n     But note: the candidate k0 for divisor g is the minimal k that makes g divide (a+k). However, the actual gcd (h) must divide d and must be a divisor of (a+k). And h might be greater than g. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we are going to consider h as well. But note: the candidate k0 for divisor h might be larger than the candidate k0 for divisor g (if h>g). However, we are only interested in the minimal k.\n\n     Therefore, we can:\n\n        Collect candidate k's from all divisors (including 1 and d). Then, for each candidate k (without duplicates) we compute the LCM (by computing GCD(a+k, d) and then LCM = (a+k)*(b+k) // GCD(a+k,d)). Then, we choose the candidate k that minimizes the LCM, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\n     But wait: is it possible that a candidate k not generated by a divisor of d might yield a lower LCM? No, because the gcd must divide d, so the condition for k is that the gcd divides d, and the minimal k that makes the gcd divisible by a divisor g is k0. However, note: the gcd might be a divisor that is not necessarily the divisor we are iterating on. But the candidate k0 we are generating for divisor g is the minimal k that makes g divide (a+k). Then, at that k, the gcd (which is GCD(a+k, d)) might be a multiple of g. But then, we would have considered that multiple (which is a divisor of d) as well. However, we are iterating over every divisor, so we will eventually consider the actual gcd.\n\n     But note: we are not forcing the gcd to be exactly g. We are just ensuring that g divides (a+k). Then, the actual gcd is the GCD(a+k, d) which is at least g. However, we are going to consider the divisor h = GCD(a+k, d) as well, and then the candidate k0 for divisor h is the same k? Not necessarily: the minimal k for divisor h is (h - a % h) % h. This k0 might be less than the current k. But wait, we are generating k0 for each divisor independently.\n\n     Therefore, we must consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we must consider all divisors.\n\n     However, the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (since sqrt(10^9) is about 31622, and the number of divisors is much less, typically around hundreds or thousands).\n\n     Steps:\n\n        1. If a == b: print 0 and exit.\n\n        2. Let d = abs(a-b). If d==0, then a==b, so already handled.\n\n        3. Factorize d and get all divisors.\n\n        4. Create an empty set for candidate_k.\n\n        5. For each divisor g of d (including 1 and d):\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n            Additionally, note: the problem might have k that is beyond the minimal one for g? But we are only interested in the minimal k per divisor. However, note: the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but the minimal k overall might be from a different divisor. However, we are collecting all k0 from all divisors.\n\n        6. But wait: is k0 always the minimal k for divisor g? Yes.\n\n        7. However, note: the divisor g must be positive, and we consider all positive divisors.\n\n        8. But note: the divisor g might be negative? No, divisors are positive.\n\n        9. Then, we also have to consider k=0 separately? Actually, k0 for g=1 is 0 (if a % 1==0, which it is) and for g=d we get a candidate k0. So we are covering k=0.\n\n        10. Now, for each candidate k in candidate_k, we compute:\n                n = a + k\n                m = b + k\n                g_val = gcd(n, m)   # which is the same as gcd(n, d) because m-n = d\n                lcm_val = n * m // g_val\n\n            But note: we must be cautious because n and m can be very large (up to 10^9 + k, and k can be up to around 10^9? Actually, d is at most 10^9, and the candidate k0 for divisor g is at most g-1, and g<=d, so k0 < d, so k0 <= 10^9. Then n and m are about 10^9, and the product is 10^18, which is acceptable in Python for integers, but the gcd computation is efficient.\n\n        11. However, note: the same candidate k might be repeated, so we use a set.\n\n        12. But wait: what if there is a candidate k that is not generated by any divisor? For example, k=0 is generated by divisor g=1 and also by divisors that divide a and b. But note: the condition is that the gcd must divide d, so the minimal k for each divisor is the candidate. However, there might be a k that is not minimal for any divisor but still gives a low LCM? \n\n        Let me test with the example: a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\n        Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n        For g=1: k0 = (1-6%1)%1 -> but 6%1 is 0, so k0=0.\n        For g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 -> 6%2=0 -> k0=0.\n        For g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 -> 6%4=2, so (4-2)=2, then 2%4=2.\n\n        Candidate k: {0, 2}\n\n        Then, we compute for k=0: \n            n=6, m=10, gcd(6,10)=2, lcm=60//2=30.\n        For k=2:\n            n=8, m=12, gcd(8,12)=4, lcm=96//4=24.\n\n        Then we choose k=2.\n\n        But wait, is there a candidate k=1? \n            k=1: n=7, m=11, gcd(7,11)=1, lcm=77.\n        Why didn't we get k=1? Because the divisor g must divide d=4. The gcd for k=1 is 1, which divides 4, so we did consider g=1, and the minimal k for g=1 is 0, not 1. However, we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. But note: the problem does not require that the divisor is the one we are iterating on, but the gcd must divide d. However, the minimal k for divisor g=1 is 0, and then we computed the LCM for k=0. But k=1 is not the minimal k for divisor g=1, so we don't consider it. \n\n        But wait: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. We are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. Is it possible that a non-minimal k (for the divisor that is the actual gcd) gives a lower LCM? \n\n        Example: Consider a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n        For divisor 1: k0 = (1-5%1)%1 -> 0\n        For divisor 5: k0 = (5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0.\n\n        Then candidate k: {0}. Then we compute for k=0: \n            n=5, m=10, gcd=5, LCM= (5*10)//5 = 10.\n\n        But what about k=1?\n            n=6, m=11, gcd=1, LCM=66 -> worse.\n\n        k=2: n=7, m=12, gcd=1, LCM=84 -> worse.\n\n        k=3: n=8, m=13, gcd=1, LCM=104 -> worse.\n\n        k=4: n=9, m=14, gcd=1, LCM=126 -> worse.\n\n        k=5: n=10, m=15, gcd=5, LCM= (10*15)//5 = 30 -> worse.\n\n        So k=0 is the best.\n\n        But what if we have a case where a non-minimal k for a divisor gives a better LCM? \n\n        Example: Let a=2, b=14, d=12. Divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n        Minimal k for each divisor:\n          g=1: k0 = (1-2%1)%1 -> 0\n          g=2: k0 = (2-2%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0\n          g=3: k0 = (3-2%3)%3 = (3-2)%3=1\n          g=4: k0 = (4-2%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2\n          g=6: k0 = (6-2%6)%6= (6-2)%6=4\n          g=12: k0 = (12-2%12)%12= (12-2)%12=10\n\n        Candidate k: {0,1,2,4,10}\n\n        Now, compute LCM for each candidate:\n\n          k=0: n=2, m=14, gcd=2, LCM= (2*14)//2 = 14.\n          k=1: n=3, m=15, gcd=3, LCM= (3*15)//3 = 15.\n          k=2: n=4, m=16, gcd=4, LCM= (4*16)//4 = 16.\n          k=4: n=6, m=18, gcd=6, LCM= (6*18)//6 = 18.\n          k=10: n=12, m=24, gcd=12, LCM= (12*24)//12 = 24.\n\n        So the minimal LCM is 14 at k=0.\n\n        But wait, is there a k that we haven't considered that might yield a lower LCM? \n\n        k=3: n=5, m=17, gcd=1, LCM=85 -> worse.\n        k=5: n=7, m=19, gcd=1, LCM=133 -> worse.\n        k=6: n=8, m=20, gcd=4, LCM= (8*20)//4=40 -> worse than 14.\n\n        So it seems that the minimal k for each divisor is the only candidate we need to consider.\n\n        Why? Because for a fixed divisor g, the minimal k that makes g divide (a+k) is k0. Then, the next k that makes g divide (a+k) is k0+g, k0+2g, etc. But note: the LCM at k0+t*g is (a+k0+t*g)*(b+k0+t*g)//gcd_value, and the gcd_value is at least g (actually, it is GCD(a+k0+t*g, d)). However, the product (a+k0+t*g)*(b+k0+t*g) is increasing with t, and the gcd_value might be increasing as well (but not necessarily). But even if the gcd_value increases, the product increases faster. Therefore, the minimal LCM for a fixed divisor g occurs at k0.\n\n        However, wait: what if the gcd_value increases to a divisor h (which is a multiple of g) as we increase k? Then the LCM might drop. But note: the minimal k for divisor h is k0_h, which might be less than k0+g? Actually, the minimal k for divisor h is independent of g. We are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider h. But note: the candidate k0 for divisor h might be less than k0+g, so we have already considered a smaller k. However, if the minimal k for h is k0_h and k0_h is greater than k0 (the minimal k for g) then we are considering k0 and k0_h separately.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is:\n\n            candidates = set()\n            d = abs(a-b)\n            Find all divisors of d.\n\n            For each divisor g in divisors:\n                k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n                candidates.add(k0)\n\n            Then, we must also consider k=0? Actually, we are already considering g=1, which gives k0=0.\n\n            Then, for each candidate k in candidates, we compute:\n                n = a+k, m = b+k\n                g_val = gcd(n, m)   # which is gcd(n, d) because m-n = d, and gcd(n,m)=gcd(n, d) [since gcd(n,m)=gcd(n, n+m) ???] Actually, note: \n                    gcd(n, m) = gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k)-(a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a) = gcd(a+k, d)   [because d = |a-b|, so sign doesn't matter]\n\n            Then, lcm_val = n * m // g_val\n\n            Then, we compare the lcm_val and choose the candidate k with the smallest lcm_val. If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\n        But wait: is it correct to use gcd(n, d) instead of gcd(n, m)? Yes, because:\n            gcd(n, m) = gcd(n, m-n) = gcd(n, d)   [since d = |a-b|, and m-n = (b+k) - (a+k) = b-a, so absolute value d, but gcd is invariant under sign].\n\n        However, note: in our computation, we set d = abs(a-b). Then, we have:\n            gcd(n, d) = gcd(a+k, abs(a-b))\n\n        But note: the gcd(n, m) is the same as gcd(n, d) because:\n            gcd(n, m) = gcd(n, m-n) and then we can take absolute value? Actually, the Euclidean algorithm uses absolute differences. But we defined d = abs(a-b). Then, we can use gcd(n, d) to compute the gcd(n, m). \n\n        However, note: \n            gcd(n, m) = gcd(n, m-n) and then we can reduce by the gcd(n, m-n) recursively. But note: m-n = b-a, which is either d or -d, but gcd is defined for positive, so we use abs.\n\n        Actually, we can compute gcd(n, d) and it is the same as gcd(n, m) because:\n            gcd(n, m) = gcd(n, m-n) = gcd(n, b-a) and then we can take absolute value? But the gcd function in Python works for nonnegative numbers. We set d = abs(a-b) so that d is positive.\n\n        However, note: the gcd(n, d) is the same as gcd(n, abs(a-b)) and that is the same as gcd(n, a-b) because gcd is invariant under sign. But wait, let me check:\n\n            gcd(8,4) = 4, and gcd(8,-4)=4.\n\n        So we can use gcd(n, d) to compute the gcd(n, m).\n\n        But note: the LCM formula: LCM(n, m) = n * m // gcd(n, m). This is standard.\n\n        However, we are computing gcd(n, d) which equals gcd(n, m). So we can do:\n\n            g_val = gcd(n, d)\n\n        Then, lcm_val = n * m // g_val\n\n        But wait: is that correct? \n\n            n * m = (a+k)*(b+k)\n            and gcd(n, m) = g_val.\n\n        Then, yes.\n\n        However, note: the LCM is defined as the least common multiple of n and m, and we are using the formula: LCM(n, m) = n * m // GCD(n, m). This is correct.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We need a function to compute gcd. We can use math.gcd.\n\n            But note: the numbers n and m can be up to 10^9 + k, and k is at most around 10^9 (since d<=10^9, and k0 < d, so k0 <= 10^9). Then n and m are up to 2e9, so the product is up to 4e18, which is within Python integer range.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                import math\n\n                a, b = map(int, input().split())\n                if a == b:\n                    print(0)\n                    exit(0)\n\n                d = abs(a-b)\n\n                # Get all divisors of d\n                def get_divisors(n):\n                    # returns a list of divisors of n\n                    i = 1\n                    divisors = set()\n                    while i*i <= n:\n                        if n % i == 0:\n                            divisors.add(i)\n                            divisors.add(n//i)\n                        i += 1\n                    return divisors\n\n                divisors_list = get_divisors(d)\n\n                candidate_ks = set()\n                for g in divisors_list:\n                    # Compute k0: the minimal nonnegative k such that (a+k) % g == 0\n                    # Note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0.\n                    # But note: if g > a, then a % g = a, so k0 = (g - a) % g.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. The solution involves leveraging mathematical insights about divisors and the properties of GCD and LCM.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This means we only need to consider divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) when determining potential values of \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), the minimal \\( k \\) that makes \\( g \\) divide both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) can be computed. This \\( k \\) is given by \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) value.\n   - For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - Among all these \\( k \\) values, select the one that yields the smallest LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's efficiency hinges on the number of divisors of \\( |a - b| \\), which is \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\) where \\( d = |a - b| \\). Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9 \\), the maximum number of divisors is around 1344, making this approach feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    \n    def get_divisors(n):\n        i = 1\n        divisors = set()\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n            i += 1\n        return divisors\n\n    divisors_list = get_divisors(d)\n    candidate_ks = set()\n    \n    for g in divisors_list:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n        candidate_ks.add(k0)\n        \n    best_k = -1\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for k in candidate_ks:\n        n = a + k\n        m = b + k\n        g_val = math.gcd(n, m)\n        current_lcm = n * m // g_val\n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If they are equal, it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself, and \\( k = 0 \\) is the smallest non-negative integer.\n\n2. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all positive divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) by checking each integer up to the square root of \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n3. **Candidate \\( k \\) Values**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the corresponding \\( k \\) is calculated as \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).
