Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a and b, the gap in the middle is (b - a). \n        To cover this gap, the light from the left lantern must extend to at least (a + d) >= (b - d) => 2*d >= (b - a). \n        So the minimum d needed for that gap is (b - a) / 2.\n\n 3. Therefore, we can compute:\n    candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0   # for the left end\n    candidate2 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0   # for the right end\n    candidate3 = max(0, (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2.0) for each consecutive pair? Actually, note that the requirement for the gap between a[i-1] and a[i] is (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.0, but wait:\n\n    Actually, if we have two lanterns at positions x and y (with x <= y), then the entire segment [x-d, x+d] and [y-d, y+d] must cover [x, y]. The gap in the middle is from x+d to y-d. To have no gap, we require x+d >= y-d => 2*d >= y - x. So the minimal d for that gap is (y-x)/2.\n\n    However, note that the entire street must be covered. So we take the maximum of all these requirements.\n\n 4. Algorithm:\n    - Read n and l.\n    - Read the list of lantern positions and sort it.\n    - If there are no lanterns (n==0), then we need d to cover the entire street, so d = l/2.0? But wait, the problem says there are n lanterns, and n>=1. So we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n    Steps:\n      sorted_ai = sorted(ai)\n\n      candidates = []\n      # left part\n      candidates.append(sorted_ai[0] / 2.0)\n\n      # right part\n      candidates.append((l - sorted_ai[-1]) / 2.0)\n\n      # gaps between lanterns\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          gap = sorted_ai[i] - sorted_ai[i-1]\n          # The minimal d needed to cover the gap between these two is gap / 2.0\n          # But note: if the lanterns are too far apart, we require d >= gap/2. However, we are looking for the minimal d that covers the whole street, so we must cover the largest gap/2 requirement.\n          candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n      Then, the answer is the maximum value in candidates.\n\n 5. However, wait: is that sufficient?\n    Example: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        n=2, l=5\n        sorted_ai = [2,5]\n\n        left part: 2/2 = 1.0\n        right part: (5-5)/2 = 0.0\n        gap: (5-2)=3 -> 3/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then maximum is 1.5, but the example output is 2.0.\n\n    This is incorrect. Why?\n\n    Let's reexamine the gap requirement: For two lanterns at 2 and 5, the entire street is from 0 to 5.\n\n    The first lantern at 2 lights [2-d, 2+d]. The second at 5 lights [5-d,5+d].\n\n    To cover the entire street [0,5]:\n        From 0 to 2-d: we require 2-d >= 0 => d>=2. But wait, we also have the gap between 2 and 5: we require that the two light beams meet or overlap.\n\n        Condition for meeting: 2+d >= 5-d  => 2d >= 3 => d>=1.5.\n\n        However, the left end requires d>=2 (because the first lantern must cover from 0 to 2, so 2-d <= 0 => d>=2). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is 2.\n\n    The mistake: In our candidate for the left part, we considered only the first lantern's distance from 0, which is 2. The condition is: the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least 2-d, so we require 2-d <= 0? Actually, the first lantern's coverage goes from 2-d to 2+d. To cover 0, we require 2-d <= 0? That would be d>=2. Alternatively, we can think: the left end (0) must be within d of some lantern. The closest lantern is at 2, so d must be at least 2.\n\n    But note: the lantern doesn't necessarily have to cover the entire left part by itself. Actually, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least 2-d, but wait: actually the left end (0) must be covered by the first lantern: so 0 must be in [2-d, 2+d] => 2-d <= 0 => d>=2.\n\n    Similarly, the right end (5) must be covered by the last lantern: 5 must be in [5-d,5+d] => 5-d<=5 and 5+d>=5 -> always true for the lower bound, but the upper bound isn't constrained by the last lantern? Actually, the last lantern must cover up to l (which is 5). So the condition is: 5+d >=5 is always true, and the condition for the right side is that the last lantern's coverage must reach l, meaning 5+d >=5 (which is always true) and the requirement is that the light from the last lantern must cover the point 5, which is always done. However, wait: the problem says the street ends at l. The lantern at 5 must cover from 5-d to 5+d. But the street is from 0 to l. The point l=5 must be covered, so 5-d <=5 is always true, and we don't require anything from the right side for covering beyond 5 because the street ends at 5.\n\n    Correction: The street is from 0 to l. The right end is l, so the last lantern must cover the point l. The condition for the last lantern to cover l is: l must be in [last_lantern - d, last_lantern + d] => last_lantern + d >= l. Since last_lantern is 5, we have 5+d>=5 -> d>=0, which is always true. But wait, what if the last lantern is not at l? Then we require d to be at least (l - last_lantern). However, in our example, the last lantern is at 5, so we don't require any extra for the right.\n\n    But wait, the example input is \"2 5\\n2 5\", so the last lantern is at 5. Then the right end is covered. What if the last lantern was at 4? Then we require d to be at least (5-4)=1.\n\n    So the correct conditions:\n\n    - The left end (0) must be within d of the first lantern: d >= (first_lantern - 0) / 1? Actually, the first lantern must cover 0, so d must be at least (first_lantern - 0) because the light extends from first_lantern-d to first_lantern+d. We require first_lantern-d <= 0 => d >= first_lantern. But wait, if the first lantern is at 2, then d>=2. However, note that the light from the first lantern goes from 2-d to 2+d. To cover 0, we require 2-d <= 0 => d>=2.\n\n    However, consider two lanterns: one at 0 and one at 5, then for the left end, the first lantern is at 0, so d>=0, but the gap between 0 and 5 requires d>=2.5.\n\n    Now, let's recast:\n\n    We must ensure the entire interval [0, l] is covered.\n\n    The idea: the entire street is covered if every point x in [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\n    We can break the problem into:\n\n    1. The leftmost segment: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position. The required d here is at least (first_lantern - 0) / 1, but actually the distance from 0 to the first lantern is first_lantern. The light from the first lantern must extend from 0 to first_lantern, so the radius must be at least first_lantern (if we consider only the first lantern). However, if there are multiple lanterns, we might use the first lantern to cover the left, but note: the first lantern is the closest to 0, so we must have d >= (first_lantern - 0) / 1? Actually, the condition is: the first lantern's light must reach 0, so d >= first_lantern (because from 0 to first_lantern is a distance of first_lantern, and the light must be at least that).\n\n    But wait, that's not the case. The light from the first lantern at a0 will cover [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require 0 >= a0-d => d >= a0. However, if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. But note: if the next lantern is very close, maybe we don't need such a big d? Actually, we are looking for the minimal d that covers the entire street.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think greedily: we want to cover the street. The entire street is covered if:\n\n    - The first lantern covers from 0 to at least (a0 + d) and the next lantern must cover the gap until the next one, etc.\n\n    Actually, a common solution for such problems is:\n\n    Step 1: sort the lantern positions.\n    Step 2: Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns, but note that the entire street must be covered.\n\n    Another method:\n\n    Let d_min = 0.0\n\n    We know that the entire street must be covered. We can simulate:\n\n    Let current_cover = 0.0 (the farthest point covered so far)\n\n    Then, for each lantern (from left to right):\n\n        If the lantern is at position a_i, then the light from this lantern must start at a_i - d_min, but wait, we are trying to find the minimal d.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use binary search on d, but the problem asks for an exact minimal d.\n\n    However, note that the minimal d must be at least half the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns? Not exactly.\n\n    Let me reframe:\n\n    The entire street is covered if:\n\n        - The leftmost lantern covers from 0 to at least the next lantern's coverage, but we can consider:\n\n        We require that the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] covers [0, l].\n\n    Conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: The leftmost point 0 must be covered: there exists a lantern such that a_i - d <= 0 <= a_i + d. The closest lantern is the first one, so we require d >= a_0 (because 0 must be >= a_0-d => d>=a_0).\n\n        Condition 2: The rightmost point l must be covered: d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n        Condition 3: Between two consecutive lanterns, the gap must be covered. Consider two consecutive lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1}. The coverage from a_i goes to a_i+d, and from a_{i+1} comes from a_{i+1}-d. The entire segment between a_i and a_{i+1} must be covered. The critical point is the midpoint? Actually, we require that the two intervals [a_i-d, a_i+d] and [a_{i+1}-d, a_{i+1}+d] must overlap or meet. The condition is: a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d => 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal d must be at least:\n\n        d >= max( a_0, l - a_{n-1}, (max_gap_between_consecutive)/2 )\n\n    But wait, in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\": \n        a0 = 2, l - a_{n-1} = 5-5=0, and the gap is (5-2)=3, so (3/2)=1.5.\n        Then d >= max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> which is the expected answer.\n\n    Now, consider the example from the problem: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n        Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        Condition 1: a0 = 0 -> d>=0\n        Condition 2: l - a_{n-1} = 15-15=0 -> d>=0\n        Condition 3: gaps: \n            3-0=3 -> 3/2=1.5\n            5-3=2 -> 2/2=1\n            7-5=2 -> 1\n            9-7=2 -> 1\n            14-9=5 -> 2.5\n            15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n        Then d >= max(0,0,1.5,1,1,1,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n        Output: 2.5\n\n    So the algorithm is:\n\n        Read n, l\n        Read the list of lantern positions and sort it.\n\n        d1 = a[0]  # because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0], so d must be at least a[0] (to cover 0)\n        d2 = l - a[-1] # the last lantern must cover from a[-1] to l, so d must be at least (l - a[-1])\n        d3 = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The minimal d required for this gap is gap/2, but note: if the gap is negative? No, sorted.\n            d3 = max(d3, gap/2.0)\n\n        answer = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n    However, wait: the condition for the left end is d>=a[0] (to cover 0) and for the right end is d>= (l - a[-1]). For the gaps, we require d>= (gap)/2.\n\n    But note: in the left end, the condition is actually d >= a[0] (because the first lantern must extend back to 0). Similarly, the right end requires d >= (l - a[-1]). And for the gaps, the condition is d >= (gap)/2.\n\n    Then we take the maximum of these three.\n\n    Let me test with the example \"2 5\\n2 5\": \n        d1 = 2, d2 = 0, d3 = 1.5 -> max(2,0,1.5)=2.\n\n    Another example: \"1 10\\n5\" (one lantern in the middle)\n        d1 = 5 (to cover 0: from 5-5=0 to 5+5=10, so covers [0,10] -> works, but minimal d is 5? Actually, yes, because the street is from 0 to 10, and the lantern at 5 must cover both ends. So d must be at least 5.\n\n    But wait, the condition for the gap doesn't apply because there's only one lantern.\n\n    How about two lanterns at [0,10] for a street of length 10?\n        d1 = 0, d2 = 0, gap = 10, so d3 = 10/2=5 -> answer=5.\n\n    Now, what if the lantern is at 0 and the street ends at 10? Then the lantern at 0 must cover [0-d,0+d]. To cover 10, we require 0+d>=10 -> d>=10. But wait, the condition for the right end is d>= (10-0)=10. The gap condition: if there's only one lantern, then the gap condition doesn't apply (we don't have consecutive lanterns). So the answer is 10.\n\n    However, what if we have two lanterns: one at 0 and one at 10, and the street is 10?\n        Then d1 = 0, d2 = 0, gap = 10 -> d3=5, so answer=5. But is 5 enough?\n            First lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers [0,5]\n            Second lantern: [10-5,10+5] = [5,15] -> covers [5,10]\n            Together, they cover [0,10]. So yes.\n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there's only one lantern, then we must cover from 0 to l, so the lantern must be at most l/2 away from both ends? Actually, the minimal d must be at least max(a[0], l - a[-1]), but note: if the single lantern is at position x, then the left condition is d>=x, the right condition is d>=l-x, so the minimal d is max(x, l-x). But wait, our method above for one lantern: \n        #   d1 = a[0] = x\n        #   d2 = l - a[-1] = l-x\n        #   d3 = 0 (since no consecutive gaps)\n        #   so answer = max(x, l-x, 0) = max(x, l-x)\n\n        # However, consider the example: one lantern at 3, street length 10 -> then d1=3, d2=7, so answer=7. But is that correct?\n        #   The lantern at 3 must cover from 3-7=-4 to 3+7=10. So yes, the entire street [0,10] is covered. But note: the minimal d might be less? \n        #   Actually, we require that the lantern covers 0 and 10. \n        #       0 must be in [3-d,3+d] -> 3-d<=0 -> d>=3.\n        #       10 must be in [3-d,3+d] -> 3+d>=10 -> d>=7.\n        #   So indeed, the minimal d is 7.\n\n        # But wait, what if we have two lanterns? Then we can use the two lanterns to share the burden.\n\n        # Our method for two lanterns: \n        #   Example: two lanterns at [3,7] for a street of length 10.\n        #   d1 = 3, d2 = 10-7=3, gap = 4 -> d3=2 -> so answer = max(3,3,2)=3.\n        #   Check: \n        #       First lantern: [0,6] (if d=3) -> covers [0,6] (since 3-3=0, 3+3=6)\n        #       Second lantern: [4,10] (7-3=4, 7+3=10)\n        #       Together, [0,6] and [4,10] -> [0,10] is covered.\n\n        # Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the left end is not exactly d>=a[0] because if there are multiple lanterns, the first lantern might not be the one that covers the left end? Actually, the first lantern is the closest to 0, so the condition d>=a[0] is necessary and sufficient for the left end (because the left end 0 must be within d of the first lantern). Similarly, the last lantern is the closest to l, so d>= (l - a[-1]) is necessary and sufficient.\n\n    But wait, what if the first lantern is not the one that must cover the left end? Actually, the left end is at 0, and the first lantern is the smallest coordinate. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. The light from the first lantern must extend to 0, so d must be at least a[0]. However, if there are multiple lanterns, could a different lantern (say the second one) cover the left end? No, because the first lantern is the closest to 0, and if the first lantern doesn't cover 0, then no lantern will because they are further away. So the condition d>=a[0] is correct.\n\n    Similarly, the condition for the right end is d>= (l - a[-1]).\n\n    And for the gaps, we require that the gap between two consecutive lanterns is covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The condition is d >= (gap)/2.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of these three values.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # Edge case: if the street has no lantern? But n>=1 per problem.\n\n        # Compute d1, d2, and d3\n        d1 = a[0]  # left end condition\n        d2 = l - a[-1]  # right end condition\n        d3 = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The minimal d for this gap is gap/2, but note: if the gap is zero, then no issue, but we take the maximum.\n            if gap > 0:\n                d3 = max(d3, gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n        # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places as per example.\n        print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: what if the entire street is already covered by the lanterns without needing to extend to the edges? For example, if we have a lantern at 0 and a lantern at l, then d1=0, d2=0, and the gaps in the middle might be large, but the condition for the gaps is the maximum gap/2. \n\n    But note: the condition for the left and right ends are independent. Even if the left end is covered by a lantern at 0 (so d1=0) and the right end by a lantern at l (so d2=0), we still must check the gaps in the middle.\n\n    The above code should work.\n\n    Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        d1 = 0\n        d2 = 15-15 = 0\n        gaps: \n            3-0=3 -> 1.5\n            5-3=2 -> 1\n            7-5=2 -> 1\n            9-7=2 -> 1\n            14-9=5 -> 2.5\n            15-14=1 -> 0.5\n        d3 = 2.5\n        ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> correct.\n\n    Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        Sorted: [2,5]\n        d1=2, d2=0, gaps: 5-2=3 -> 1.5 -> ans=2.0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 3: \"1 10\\n5\"\n        d1=5, d2=5, gaps: none -> ans=5.0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 4: \"1 10\\n3\"\n        d1=3, d2=7, gaps: none -> ans=7.0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 5: \"2 10\\n3 7\"\n        d1=3, d2=3, gaps: 4 -> 2.0 -> ans=3.0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 6: \"0 lanterns\" -> but n>=1, so skip.\n\n    Example 7: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n        d1=0, d2=0, gaps: 5-0=5 -> 2.5; 10-5=5 -> 2.5 -> ans=2.5 -> correct.\n\n    Example 8: \"3 10\\n0 2 10\"\n        d1=0, d2=0, gaps: 2-0=2 -> 1; 10-2=8 -> 4 -> ans=4.0.\n\n        Check: \n            First lantern at 0: covers [0-4,0+4]=[-4,4] -> covers [0,2] and the left end 0.\n            Second lantern at 2: covers [2-4,2+4]=[-2,6] -> but wait, we set d=4, so it covers from -2 to 6, which covers the gap between 0 and 2 and also extends to 6.\n            Third lantern at 10: covers [10-4,10+4]=[6,14] -> so the entire street [0,10] is covered from 0 to 10.\n\n        However, note: the gap between 2 and 10 is 8, so the condition is d>= (8)/2=4, which is met.\n\n    But wait, what if we set d=3.9? Then the third lantern would cover [6.1,13.9] which does not cover 6 (the street includes 6). Actually, the street is from 0 to 10, and the second lantern at 2 with d=3.9 covers up to 5.9, and the third lantern at 10 with d=3.9 covers from 10-3.9=6.1 to 13.9. Then the point 6.0 is not covered. So 4.0 is minimal.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the gaps is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the gap between them. The minimal d required for the gap between two lanterns at positions x and y (x<y) is (y-x)/2. This is because the left lantern's light must reach at least x+d, and the right lantern's light must start at y-d, and we require x+d >= y-d => d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n    We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n    One more edge: if the street is of length 0? But l>=1 per problem.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the street is from 0 to l (inclusive). The lanterns can be at 0 and l.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # Conditions for the left and right\n        d_left = a[0]  # to cover from 0 to a[0], we need d >= a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]  # to cover from a[-1] to l, we need d >= l - a[-1]\n\n        # Conditions for gaps between lanterns\n        d_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The minimal d for this gap is gap/2, but if the gap is 0, then no requirement (but we take max so 0 is okay)\n            required = gap / 2.0\n            if required > d_gap:\n                d_gap = required\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait, what if there are duplicate lanterns? Then the gap might be 0, which is okay.\n\n    Example: two lanterns at the same position, say [3,3] for a street of length 10.\n        d_left = 3\n        d_right = 7\n        gap = 0 -> d_gap=0\n        ans = 7.0\n\n    Correct, because the two lanterns at 3 must cover the entire street. The left end requires d>=3, the right end requires d>=7, and the gap condition is 0. So the minimal d is 7.\n\n    However, with two lanterns at 3, the coverage is [3-d,3+d] for both. To cover 0: 3-d<=0 -> d>=3; to cover 10: 3+d>=10 -> d>=7. So 7 is minimal.\n\n    Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n    But note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point. Our gap calculation uses consecutive elements, so duplicates will be adjacent and the gap is 0, which is handled correctly.\n\n    We'll run the code with the provided examples.\n\n    Example Input: \n        \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n    Output: \n        \"2.5000000000\"\n        \"2.0000000000\"\n\n    The code produces:\n\n        For \"7 15\": 2.5 -> formatted to \"2.500000000\"\n        For \"2 5\": 2.0 -> formatted to \"2.000000000\"\n\n    Perfect.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the answer must be considered correct if absolute or relative error <= 1e-9. Our method uses floating point and the operations are basic, so it should be precise.\n\n    Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for all lantern positions `a_i`. The minimal `d` must satisfy three conditions:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0), so `d` must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (`l`), so `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. Specifically, the distance between two consecutive lanterns should not exceed `2 * d`, meaning `d` must be at least half the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the lantern positions to easily access the first and last lanterns and to compute gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Compute Requirements**: Calculate the minimal `d` required for left end coverage, right end coverage, and the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Determine Minimal `d`**: The answer is the maximum value among the three computed requirements, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes `O(n log n)` time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent steps involve linear scans to compute gaps, which is `O(n)`. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    d_left = a[0]\n    d_right = l - a[-1]\n    d_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required = gap / 2.0\n        if required > d_gap:\n            d_gap = required\n            \n    ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n    print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of the leftmost and rightmost coverage requirements and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Left and Right Coverage**: The minimal `d` required to cover the start (0) and end (`l`) of the street is computed as the distance from the first and last lantern to these points, respectively.\n4. **Gap Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The minimal `d` needed to cover this gap is half the gap size. The largest such value across all gaps is noted.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value among the left coverage, right coverage, and the largest gap coverage requirement, ensuring the entire street is illuminated. The result is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places. \n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal light radius by leveraging sorting and linear scans, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
