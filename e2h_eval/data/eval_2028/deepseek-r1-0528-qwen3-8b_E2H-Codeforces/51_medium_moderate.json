Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any extra whitespace including newline) to get the expected letters.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the expected string and in the pile string.\n\n Alternatively, we can sort the combined names and sort the pile. Then compare if the sorted combined names equals the sorted pile.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'] -> wait, actually the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n But note: the example input format is three lines.\n\n Let me clarify the example:\n\n   Example Input:\n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But wait, the example input has three separate strings? Actually, the problem says three lines.\n\n   Let me re-read: \n        The input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So, we should read three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three elements, each element being a string that might contain multiple lines? \n\n   Actually, looking at the example input:\n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing. The problem says three lines.\n\n   Clarification from the problem: \n        The first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the host's name, the third line contains the pile.\n\n   But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This seems to be a representation of the entire input as a list of three strings, but each string itself contains newlines.\n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example input string for the first sample is written as: \n        'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   That means the first string in the list is actually \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is three lines concatenated with '\\n'.\n\n   However, the problem says three lines. So when reading from stdin, we would do:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile_str = input().strip()\n\n   But wait, the example input has the guest's name, host's name, and then the pile all in separate lines.\n\n   However, the example input representation in the problem is one string per line? \n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Input:\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   So, we are to read three lines.\n\n   But the example input provided in the problem is given as a list of three strings, each string containing a mix of letters and newline characters. \n\n   Let me check the example outputs: \n        Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   And the example input is three different cases? \n\n   Actually, the example input is one case, then a second case, then a third case?\n\n   The problem states:\n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is just a representation of three test cases. But the problem says:\n\n        The input file consists of three lines: ...\n\n   So, we are to write a program that reads one test case at a time.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings. But note: the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   We'll assume that the input is three lines. So we read three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input representation is confusing. Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        Case 1: \n            guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Case 2:\n            guest: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            host: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Case 3:\n            guest: \"BABBONATALE\"\n            host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n   However, the example input string is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is a single string that contains three lines? Or is it a list of three strings, each string containing one line?\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but each string is the entire content of one test case? \n\n   But the problem says: the input file consists of three lines. So if we are to write a program that reads until EOF, then we must account for multiple test cases?\n\n   Looking at the problem statement: \"The input file consists of three lines\" — meaning one test case.\n\n   However, the example output is a list of three strings: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n   This implies that the example input is actually three separate test cases? But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \n\n        Input\n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n   So, one test case: three lines.\n\n   But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing because the example input representation has three lines in the first string? \n\n   Actually, the example input representation is showing three test cases. Each string is a representation of the entire input for one test case? \n\n   However, the problem says the input file has three lines. So for each test case, we have three lines.\n\n   But the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being the concatenation of three lines (with '\\n' separating them). \n\n   So, if we are to write a program that handles one test case, we read three lines. But the example input representation is for three test cases.\n\n   I think there was a misrepresentation. The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input. \n\n   The example input is actually three test cases, but the problem description says one test case.\n\n   Wait, the example input is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   And the example output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So, the input has three test cases, each test case having three lines (but represented in one string with '\\n').\n\n   How should we read? \n\n   The problem says the input file has three lines. So if we are running the program on a file that contains three lines, that's one test case.\n\n   But the example input is given as three strings, each containing three lines. This suggests that the example input is actually three test cases, and the input file would have nine lines.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n   There's an ambiguity.\n\n   Let me check the note: \n\n        In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\n   The first sample: \n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   So, the pile is the third line.\n\n   Therefore, one test case has three lines.\n\n   But the example input representation is three test cases. \n\n   Since the problem says the input file has three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input representation is for three test cases. \n\n   This is likely a mistake in the problem statement. The intended input is one test case of three lines.\n\n   But the sample input provided in the example is three test cases.\n\n   So, we must handle multiple test cases? \n\n   The problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\". It doesn't specify how many test cases. \n\n   Let me look at the constraints: the length of each line does not exceed 100. \n\n   And the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being the entire input for a test case (with three lines).\n\n   Since the problem statement says the input file has three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example output is three answers.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \n\n        Input: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\n   So, one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n   The problem says: \"Example Input\" and then provides a list of three strings. \n\n   And the example output is a list of three strings.\n\n   This implies that the example input is actually three separate test cases, each test case consisting of three lines (so total nine lines). \n\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n   Now, I see the confusion: the example input representation is not matching the problem description.\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a single string that contains three test cases, each test case being three lines. \n\n   The problem statement should have said: \"You may assume that the input has multiple test cases, each test case consisting of three lines.\"\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   Alternatively, the example input representation is just showing three examples, but the program must handle one test case at a time.\n\n   Since the problem says the input file has three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input is given as three test cases. \n\n   How did the example output become three answers? \n\n   This suggests that the problem expects multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me check the constraints: the length of each line does not exceed 100, and there are no other constraints.\n\n   The problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   However, the example input representation is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   and the example output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So, if we are to write a program that reads multiple test cases, then we can read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n   There's an inconsistency.\n\n   Since the problem statement says three lines, but the example input is three test cases (each with three lines), we must ask for clarification.\n\n   However, since this is a competitive programming problem, we can deduce:\n\n   Option 1: There is only one test case. Then the example input representation is incorrect.\n\n   Option 2: There are multiple test cases. The input file may have multiple sets of three lines.\n\n   How many test cases? The example input has three test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Looking at the note: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\"\n\n   And the example input is three test cases.\n\n   In competitive programming problems, sometimes the input has multiple test cases. \n\n   The problem does not specify the number of test cases, but the example input has three.\n\n   How to proceed?\n\n   We can read until EOF. Each test case is three lines.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\" — meaning one test case.\n\n   This is conflicting.\n\n   Another possibility: the example input representation is a way to show the entire input for the example, and the actual input for one test case is three lines.\n\n   But then why the example output is three answers?\n\n   I think there was a miscommunication in the problem statement.\n\n   After checking similar problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement does not explicitly say \"There are multiple test cases\", we stick to one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as three test cases.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        [Then the problem description]\n\n        Example Input\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This example input is shown as a list of three strings. But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   So, if the input file has three lines, then we read three lines. But the example input representation is three test cases, meaning the input file has nine lines.\n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   I will assume that the problem intends to have multiple test cases, and the input is given until EOF, with each test case being three lines.\n\n   Why? Because the example input is given as three test cases and the output is three answers.\n\n   Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                guest = input().strip()\n                host = input().strip()\n                pile = input().strip()\n\n                # Combine guest and host\n                target = guest + host\n                # Check if sorted(target) == sorted(pile)\n\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines. So if we break after one test case, we don't know.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that the example input is provided as one string that contains three test cases, but that's not standard.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        Input: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\n   This clearly states one test case.\n\n   But the example input is three test cases.\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   I decide to follow the example input and output.\n\n   The example input is three test cases, so we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example expects multiple test cases, we'll read until EOF.\n\n   Each test case: three lines.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        test_cases = []\n        while True:\n            try:\n                line1 = input().strip()\n                line2 = input().strip()\n                line3 = input().strip()\n                # Process the test case\n                target = line1 + line2\n                if sorted(target) == sorted(line3):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n\n   However, the problem says the input file has three lines. But if we read three lines and then break, that's one test case.\n\n   But the example input has three test cases, so we need to read three times (each test case is three lines) until EOF.\n\n   But what if there is only one test case? Then we read three lines and break.\n\n   This matches the problem statement.\n\n   However, the example input has three test cases. So we would read 9 lines.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being the three lines for one test case.\n\n   But the actual input file would have:\n\n        Line1: SANTACLAUS\n        Line2: DEDMOROZ\n        Line3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        Line4: PAPAINOEL\n        Line5: JOULUPUKKI\n        Line6: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n        Line7: BABBONATALE\n        Line8: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        Line9: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   Then we process three test cases.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n   This is still conflicting.\n\n   I think the problem statement intended to say: \"The input consists of three lines\" for one test case, but the example input is showing three test cases.\n\n   Since the example output is three answers, the intended behavior is to handle multiple test cases.\n\n   We'll go with the multiple test cases approach.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        # But wait, the input is three lines per test case. How many test cases? We don't know.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem says the input file has three lines. But if there are multiple test cases, then the input file has 3 * n lines.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        lines = []\n        while True:\n            try:\n                line = input().strip()\n                lines.append(line)\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n\n        Then, group the lines into groups of three.\n\n        But the problem says the first line is guest, second line host, third line pile. Then next test case starts with guest.\n\n        However, the input order is:\n\n            Test case 1: \n                line0: guest\n                line1: host\n                line2: pile\n\n            Test case 2:\n                line3: guest\n                line4: host\n                line5: pile\n\n        So, we can process in groups.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read three lines at a time until EOF.\n\n   Let me change the reading method:\n\n        test_cases = []\n        while True:\n            guest = input().strip()\n            host = input().strip()\n            pile = input().strip()\n            test_cases.append( (guest, host, pile) )\n            # If we hit EOF, then we break after the third line fails? But the input is three lines per test case.\n\n        But if we get EOF in the middle, that would cause an error.\n\n        The problem says the input file has three lines. So we assume that the input is complete.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I'll assume the input has multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\n   We'll read until we have read the entire input (until EOF) and then process every three lines.\n\n   But the problem says three lines for the whole input. So if we read more than three lines, that's an error.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem statement is for one test case, and the example input representation is just a way to show three examples.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Example Input\" and then shows a list of three strings.\n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   Let me look at the problem statement again: \n\n        Example Input\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This example input is given as three strings. But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   I think the intended meaning is that the input file has three lines, and the example input is one test case with three lines.\n\n   However, the example input string is long and includes three lines. \n\n   Actually, the example input for the first test case is:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the first string in the list is \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is three lines separated by '\\n'. \n\n   So, if we read the first line as \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", that would be one line.\n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   Therefore, the example input representation is not matching the input format.\n\n   I think there was a formatting issue in the problem statement.\n\n   We must read three separate lines.\n\n   And the example input is three test cases, but the input file for the system tests might have multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, I decide to read three lines and then stop.\n\n   If the input has more than three lines, then we ignore the rest or consider it as part of the next test case? But the problem says three lines.\n\n   Therefore, the intended solution is to read three lines.\n\n   But the example output is three answers, meaning three test cases.\n\n   I think the problem statement meant to say: \"You may assume that there are up to ? test cases, each consisting of three lines.\"\n\n   But without knowing the number, we must use the following:\n\n        We'll read three lines.\n\n        Then, we'll process that one test case.\n\n        But the example input is three test cases.\n\n   This is a mess.\n\n   Let me try to submit a solution that works for one test case and see if it passes the sample.\n\n   Sample test case 1:\n\n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Now, sort(target) and sort(pile) should be the same.\n\n        target_sorted = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        pile_sorted = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n        Let's count:\n\n            target: \n                S: 3, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, Z: 1\n\n            pile: \n                S: 3, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, L: 1, U: 1\n\n            But wait, the pile has an 'R' and the target doesn't? \n\n            Actually, let me check:\n\n                target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> breaks down as:\n                    SANTACLAUS + DEDMOROZ\n\n                SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> actually, wait:\n\n                    SANTACLAUS: \n                        S: 2, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1\n\n                DEDMOROZ:\n                    D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 2, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n                Combined: \n                    S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n                Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n                Let's break down the pile:\n\n                    SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n                S: appears 3 times?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (frequency count) of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters in the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to verify if the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined guest and host names, with no extra or missing letters. This means the sorted list of letters from the combined names should match the sorted list of letters from the pile.\n2. **Intuition**: By comparing the sorted versions of the combined names and the pile, we can efficiently check if they are permutations of each other. If the sorted strings are identical, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves reading three input lines (guest name, host name, and pile), concatenating the first two lines, sorting both the concatenated string and the pile string, and then comparing them.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The dominant operation is sorting the strings. Given that the maximum length of each line is 100, the total length of the combined string and the pile is at most 200 characters. Sorting such a string is efficient, typically O(n log n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three lines from the standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the concatenated string and the pile string are sorted. If the sorted versions match, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters using sorting, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
