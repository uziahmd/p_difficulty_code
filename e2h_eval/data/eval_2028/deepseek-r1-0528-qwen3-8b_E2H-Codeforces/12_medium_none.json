The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are moving along a circular ringroad (clockwise) with n houses. \n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house ai (with the condition that tasks are done in increasing order of index).\n\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way, we can consider the movement as going from house i to house j by:\n   If j >= i: then the distance is (j - i) mod n, but note: because it's circular and we can only go clockwise, \n   actually if we are at house i and want to go to house j, the distance is (j - i) if j >= i, \n   but if j < i, then we have to go from i to the end and then wrap around: so (n - i + j).\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the houses arranged in a circle of size n. The distance from i to j (moving clockwise) is:\n   (j - i) % n, but wait: if j < i, then (j - i) is negative, so modulo doesn't work directly.\n\n Actually, we can compute the clockwise distance from i to j as:\n   If j >= i: distance = j - i\n   Else: distance = (n - i) + j\n\n But note: we are allowed to traverse the entire circle. However, since the tasks must be done in order, we cannot jump arbitrarily.\n\n However, note that we might complete multiple tasks consecutively without moving (if the next task is at the same house or behind? But wait: the condition is that we must complete all tasks with numbers less than i first. So we do them in order.\n\n Actually, the problem requires that we do the tasks in the given order (from the first to the last). \n\n Example: \n   Input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\": \n        Start at 1, then need to go to 3, then from 3 to 2, then from 2 to 3.\n\n   Steps: \n        From 1 to 3: \n            Since 3 >= 1, we can go 1->2->3 (distance 2)\n        Then from 3 to 2: \n            Since 2 < 3, we go 3->4->1->2 (distance (4-3)+2 = 1+2 = 3? But wait: 3->4: 1, 4->1: 1, 1->2: 1 -> total 3? But example says 6 total time units for the whole sequence.\n\n   Total time: 2 (for first part) + 3 (for second) + ... wait, then from 2 to 3: \n        From 2 to 3: 1 unit.\n\n   So 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\n\n   That is: \n        Start at 1, then move to 2 (time 1), then to 3 (time 2), then to 4 (time 3), then to 1 (time 4), then to 2 (time 5), then to 3 (time 6).\n\n   However, note that after completing the first task (at house 3) we are at house 3. Then we need to go to house 2. \n        From 3 to 2: we must go clockwise: 3->4->1->2. That's 3 steps: so time increases by 3 (from time=2 to time=5). Then from 2 to 3: 1 step (time=6).\n\n   But note: the example does not break down by task. The condition is: complete the i-th task at house ai, and before that we must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n   Therefore, we can break the journey into segments between consecutive tasks (including the starting point and the first task).\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let positions = [a1, a2, ..., am] (the required houses for each task)\n\n   We start at house 1.\n\n   Then for the first task, we go from 1 to a1.\n   Then from a1 to a2.\n   Then from a2 to a3.\n   ...\n\n   The total time is the sum of the distances for each segment.\n\n   How to compute the distance from current house x to next house y?\n\n   Since the ringroad is circular and clockwise, we can define:\n\n        distance(x, y) = (y - x) % n   ... but this modulo doesn't give the positive distance.\n\n   Instead, we can use:\n\n        if y >= x:\n            d = y - x\n        else:\n            d = n - x + y\n\n   Alternatively, we can use modular arithmetic:\n\n        d = (y - x) % n\n        but wait: if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, and (y-x)%n gives a positive number: (y-x+n) % n, which is the same as n - (x-y) but that is not the same as our formula.\n\n   Let's check: \n        Example: x=3, y=2, n=4: \n            (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3, which is the same as n - (3-2) = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\n        Another: x=1, y=3, n=4: \n            (3-1)%4 = 2, which is correct.\n\n   So we can write: \n        distance = (y - x) % n\n        BUT: wait, the modulus operation for negative: in Python, a % b is non-negative. \n\n   However, note: the modulus operation gives a result in the range [0, n-1]. But when we are at house 1 and going to house 1, then (1-1)%n=0, which is correct.\n\n   However, if we are at house 4 and going to house 1 (n=4): \n        (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1, which is not the same as the actual steps (which should be 1: 4->1 is one step). But wait, according to our direct calculation: \n        From 4 to 1: \n            Since 1 < 4, then d = n - 4 + 1 = 4-4+1 = 1. Correct.\n\n   But note: our formula using modulus: (y-x)%n gives 1, which is the same.\n\n   However, let me verify the modulus method: \n        We want the clockwise distance from x to y. The total circle is n. The clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative number of steps such that x + d ≡ y (mod n) and d is taken in the range [0, n-1].\n\n        Actually, we can also compute: \n            d = (y - x) % n\n        but if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x)%n = (y-x+n) % n, which is the same as adding n until we get a positive value.\n\n        This is exactly the distance we want: \n            If y >= x, then (y-x) is positive and less than n (because y<=n and x>=1, but if x==y then 0; if y>=x and y-x < n, then modulus doesn't change) so d = y-x.\n            If y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so we add n: d = y - x + n, which is the same as our else clause.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute the distance from x to y as: (y - x) % n, but wait: what if (y-x) is negative and we are using modulus? In Python, modulus for negative gives the positive remainder.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (y-x) % n is defined as: \n        (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n   For a negative a, it will add enough multiples of n to make it non-negative.\n\n   But wait: is this the same as the clockwise distance? \n\n        Example: from 3 to 2 in a ring of 4: \n            (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 (since -1 + 4 = 3).\n\n        Example: from 4 to 1 in a ring of 4: \n            (1-4) % 4 = (-3) % 4 = 1 (since -3 + 4 = 1).\n\n   So yes, it matches.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python is well-defined and gives a non-negative result. But note: we are not taking modulus by n in the usual way for circular distances? Actually, the modulus operation here gives the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n   But wait: what if we are going from house 1 to house 1? \n        (1-1)%n = 0 -> correct.\n\n   So we can compute the distance from x to y as: (y - x) % n, but note: if the result is negative, we adjust by adding n until positive, which modulus does.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the modulus operation does not necessarily give the minimal nonnegative residue? Actually, it does: the result is in [0, n-1]. And the clockwise distance from x to y is indeed in [0, n-1]. \n\n   But wait: the problem says that moving from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit. The entire circle has n houses, so the maximum distance should be n-1? \n\n   However, consider: from house 1 to house n (last house) in a circle of n: \n        (n - 1) % n = n-1, which is correct because we go 1->2->...->n, which is n-1 steps.\n\n   But wait: the example above from 4 to 1 (n=4) was 1 step, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can calculate the distance from x to y as: \n        d = (y - x) % n\n        However, wait: if y==x, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n   But note: the modulus operation does not require adjustment because the distance from x to y is defined as the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. And since we can only move clockwise, the distance is the minimal nonnegative steps to reach y from x.\n\n   However, there is an alternative: sometimes people use modulo arithmetic differently. But the above holds.\n\n   But wait: what if the task list is long (up to 10^5) and we do modulus for each adjacent pair? That would be 10^5 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation is cheap, but we must be cautious: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so we can do 10^5 modulus operations.\n\n   But wait: let me check the example again: \n        Example 2: Input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n        Start at 1, then go to 2: \n            (2-1)%4 = 1 -> correct (1 step)\n        Then from 2 to 3: \n            (3-2)%4 = 1 -> correct (1 step)\n        Then from 3 to 3: \n            (3-3)%4 = 0 -> correct (0 steps)\n\n        Total time: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n        Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n   Therefore, the plan:\n\n        Read n and m.\n        Read the list of m integers.\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current_house = 1\n\n        For each task_house in the list:\n            distance = (task_house - current_house) % n\n            But wait: what if the modulus gives a negative? Actually, in our examples, we saw that when task_house < current_house, the modulus gives a positive number.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined as (a-b) % n, and if (a-b) is negative, it adds n until positive.\n\n            But let me test with a negative: \n                (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 -> which is correct.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus operation is giving the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n            But note: the modulus operation is defined for any integer. So we can use:\n\n            d = (task_house - current_house) % n\n\n            However, wait: what if the modulus returns 0? Then we don't move. What if the modulus returns a positive number? Then we move that many steps.\n\n            But note: the modulus operation might return 0 even if we are at the same house, which is correct.\n\n            However, there is a potential issue: the modulus operation in this case is giving the minimal nonnegative representation, but note that the clockwise distance is the minimal nonnegative representation. \n\n            But wait: what if the modulus operation gives a value greater than or equal to n? Actually, no: because (task_house - current_house) is in the range [-(n-1), n-1] (since both are between 1 and n). Then modulus n will give a value in [0, n-1].\n\n            However, there's a catch: the modulus operation does not necessarily represent the clockwise distance if we consider the entire circle. But note: the circle has n houses, so the clockwise distance from x to y must be in [0, n-1]. \n\n            But wait: is there a possibility that the direct modulus doesn't account for the fact that we can only go clockwise? Actually, the modulus operation gives the same as the clockwise distance because:\n\n                The clockwise distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) mod n = y mod n.\n\n                However, note: the houses are numbered 1 to n. We can map them to 0 to n-1? \n\n            Let me map: \n                House 1 -> 0, House 2 -> 1, ... House n -> n-1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from house i (mapped to i-1) to house j (mapped to j-1) is: (j-1 - (i-1)) % n, but then if negative we add n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the circular array of length n. The clockwise distance from i to j (in the original numbering) is the same as the clockwise distance from (i-1) to (j-1) in the array of length n.\n\n            But wait, our modulus operation above uses the original numbers. \n\n            Example: from 4 to 1 (n=4): \n                Original: 4 and 1 -> (1-4) % 4 = -3 % 4 = 1 (in Python).\n                Mapped: 4->3, 1->0: (0-3) % 4 = -3 % 4 = 1 (same).\n\n            Example: from 1 to 4 (n=4): \n                Original: (4-1) % 4 = 3 % 4 = 3.\n                Mapped: (3-0) % 4 = 3 % 4 = 3.\n\n            Example: from 3 to 2 (n=4): \n                Original: (2-3) % 4 = -1 % 4 = 3.\n                Mapped: (1-2) % 4 = -1 % 4 = 3.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in the example above for (a-b) % n is the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus operation gives a negative? Actually, in Python, the modulus always returns a nonnegative value.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            d = (task_house - current_house) % n\n\n        However, wait: what if (task_house - current_house) is negative? Then we add n until positive, but modulus does that.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python is defined for negative numbers as: \n            a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n        For negative a: floor(-1/4) = -1, so (-1)%4 = -1 - 4*(-1) = -1 +4 = 3.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: if the modulus operation returns 0, that's correct (no movement). But note: the modulus operation might also return 0 if the two houses are the same, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: is there a situation where the modulus operation returns a value that is not the clockwise distance? \n\n            Consider: from house 1 to house 5 in a ring of 4? \n            But wait: the problem states that houses are numbered 1 through n. So if n=4, then house 5 does not exist. Our input ensures that each ai is between 1 and n.\n\n        Therefore, we can rely on the modulus.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in the formula (y-x) % n might not be the standard way to compute the clockwise distance because the standard way is to break the circle and then consider the linear path. But mathematically, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y-x) mod n, but with the understanding that if (y-x) is negative, then we add n.\n\n        Since modulus does that, we can use it.\n\n        But wait: is (y-x) mod n the same as the clockwise distance? \n\n            Yes, because the clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (x + d) ≡ y (mod n). And d = (y-x) mod n.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined such that (x + d) mod n = (x + (y-x)) mod n = y mod n, but wait: \n\n            (x + (y-x)) mod n = y mod n, but if y-x is negative, then we have to add n until positive. And that's what modulus does.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total = 0\n            for a in tasks:\n                # Compute the clockwise distance from current to a\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # However, wait: what if d is 0? Then we don't move. But note: the modulus operation gives 0 for same house.\n\n                # But wait: there's a problem: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative solution. However, note that the clockwise distance from x to y is defined as (y-x) mod n, but in a circle of n houses, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y-x) mod n, but wait: \n\n                # Let me reexamine: \n                #   The entire circle has n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is the number of steps we move clockwise to get from x to y.\n\n                #   We can also compute: \n                #       If a >= current: d = a - current\n                #       Else: d = a - current + n\n\n                #   But note: (a - current) % n is equivalent to:\n                #       if a >= current: d = a - current (because positive and less than n? Not necessarily: a - current could be >= n? \n                #           Example: n=4, current=1, a=5 -> but a is at most n, so a<=n, and current>=1, so a-current <= n-1, which is less than n. So then modulus doesn't change.\n\n                #       if a < current: then a - current is negative, so we add n: d = a - current + n.\n\n                #   But note: a and current are in [1, n]. Then a - current is in [-n+1, n-1]. So the modulus operation is safe.\n\n                #   However, there is a better way: \n\n                #   d = (a - current) % n\n                #   But wait: what if (a - current) is negative and we are using modulus? It will be adjusted to the positive equivalent.\n\n                #   However, note: the modulus operation returns a value in [0, n-1]. But the clockwise distance from x to y must be in [0, n-1] (if we consider that we can go from x to y in at most n-1 steps, because after n steps we are back to x).\n\n                #   But wait: the problem does not require to take the minimal path in terms of the entire circle? Actually, the problem forces us to move only clockwise, so we cannot go counterclockwise. Therefore, the distance is fixed.\n\n                #   However, there's a catch: the modulus operation gives the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n                #   But wait: let's test with a negative and positive:\n\n                #       Example: n=5, current=3, a=1.\n                #           (1-3) %5 = (-2)%5 = 3. \n                #           Steps: 3->4->5->1: that's 3 steps? Actually: \n                #               3 to 4: 1 step, 4 to 5: 2, 5 to 1: 3. Correct.\n\n                #       Example: n=5, current=3, a=4: \n                #           (4-3)%5=1 -> correct.\n\n                #   Therefore, we can use the modulus.\n\n                # However, wait: the modulus operation is giving the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n                # But note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is the same as (a-b) mod n, which is the mathematical definition.\n\n                # So we can use:\n\n                total += d\n                current = a\n\n        Then print(total)\n\n        However, wait: let's run the first example: \n            Input: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Start: current=1, total=0.\n\n            First task: a=3\n                d = (3-1)%4 = 2%4 = 2 -> total=2, current=3.\n\n            Second task: a=2\n                d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> total=2+3=5, current=2.\n\n            Third task: a=3\n                d = (3-2)%4 = 1%4 = 1 -> total=5+1=6.\n\n            Output: 6 -> correct.\n\n        Second example: \n            Input: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n            Start: current=1, total=0.\n\n            First task: a=2 -> d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total=1, current=2.\n            Second task: a=3 -> d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total=2, current=3.\n            Third task: a=3 -> d=0 -> total=2.\n\n            Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a task list that wraps around more than once? \n\n        Example: n=3, tasks=[3,1,2]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            First: 1 to 3: (3-1)%3=2 -> total=2, current=3.\n            Second: 3 to 1: (1-3)%3 = (-2)%3 = 1 -> total=3, current=1.\n            Third: 1 to 2: (2-1)%3=1 -> total=4.\n\n            Actual moves: \n                Start at 1.\n                Move 1->2->3: 2 steps (time=2)\n                Then from 3: 3->1: 1 step (time=3)\n                Then from 1->2: 1 step (time=4)\n\n            Correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation is giving the minimal representation, but note that the modulus operation is defined as the remainder after division, and the remainder is in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But wait: what if the modulus operation returns a value that is not the minimal steps? \n\n        Let me clarify: the modulus operation for negative numbers is defined to give a nonnegative remainder. The clockwise distance is defined as the minimal nonnegative steps. So modulus gives that.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            total = 0\n            current = 1\n            for num in arr:\n                # Calculate the distance from current to num\n                # Using modulus: (num - current) % n\n                d = (num - current) % n\n                # But wait: if d == 0, then we don't move, which is correct.\n                total += d\n                current = num\n\n            print(total)\n\n        However, wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        But wait: consider the following: \n\n            Example: n=5, current=5, next task=1: \n                d = (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 (because -4 + 5 = 1) -> correct, because from 5 to 1: 5->1 is 1 step (since 5->1 is the next clockwise).\n\n            Example: n=5, current=5, next task=2: \n                d = (2-5)%5 = (-3)%5 = 2 -> steps: 5->1->2: 2 steps, correct.\n\n        So the code should be correct.\n\n        However, wait: there's a potential performance issue? We are doing modulus for each of the m tasks (up to 10^5). Modulus is O(1) so it's acceptable.\n\n        But wait: I just realized: the modulus operation for negative numbers is defined, but what if the difference is negative and very large? \n\n            Example: n=10**5, current=10**5, next task=1: \n                d = (1 - 10**5) % 10**5 = (1 - 100000) % 100000 = (-99999) % 100000 = 1 (because -99999 + 100000 = 1)\n\n            Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus.\n\n        However, wait: there's an alternative way that might be clearer: \n\n            d = (num - current) % n\n            But note: if (num - current) is negative, then (num - current) % n = (num - current + n) % n, but since (num - current) is negative, adding n once is enough because |num - current| < n (because num and current are in [1, n]). \n\n            Actually, the absolute value of (num - current) is at most n-1, so one addition of n is enough.\n\n        But the modulus operation is doing that automatically.\n\n        Therefore, we'll use the modulus.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation might be slower than a conditional? But 10^5 operations is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But let me check with the worst-case: 10^5 modulus operations. \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid modulus by:\n\n            if num >= current:\n                d = num - current\n            else:\n                d = num - current + n\n\n        This is the same and avoids modulus. Which is faster?\n\n        Let's test with a small example:\n\n            n=4, current=3, num=2: \n                Condition: 2>=3? False -> d = 2-3+4 = 3 -> same.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if num >= current:\n                d = num - current\n            else:\n                d = num - current + n\n\n        This is also clear and avoids modulus.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation is defined for negative, and we know the inputs are integers, so either way is fine.\n\n        However, the modulus version is concise.\n\n        But wait: there's a potential pitfall with modulus: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined, but some other languages might not. Since we are in Python, it's safe.\n\n        But the problem says: use cin, cout or %I64d in C++, so we are writing in Python.\n\n        Let me choose the modulus version for clarity.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation might be slightly more expensive than a simple subtraction and comparison. \n\n        But 10^5 operations is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But let me run a quick benchmark in mind: modulus is a single operation, and the conditional is two comparisons and a subtraction. \n\n        However, the problem constraints are 10^5, so both are acceptable.\n\n        I'll stick to the modulus version.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for a in arr:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to a\n                ans += (a - current) % n\n                current = a\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But wait: wait! There's a catch.\n\n        The modulus operation gives the same as the clockwise distance only if we consider that the circle has n houses. However, note that the modulus operation gives a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But observe: the distance from x to y clockwise is (y-x) mod n, which is the same as (y-x+n) % n. \n\n        However, note: the example with x=1, y=1: (1-1)%n=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two consecutive tasks that are the same? Then we add 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a task that is the same as the current house? Then we don't move.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not account for the fact that we might have moved more than necessary? \n\n        Actually, no: the modulus operation is giving the minimal steps to get from x to y by going clockwise.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not require the minimal steps overall, but the steps we take while doing the tasks in order. \n\n        However, note: we are forced to move only clockwise, and the tasks are in order. Therefore, the minimal steps for each segment is exactly the clockwise distance.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: let me test with a different example: \n\n            n=10, tasks=[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n            Start at 1.\n\n            Segment 1: 1 to 10: \n                (10-1)%10 = 9 -> correct (steps: 1->2->...->10: 9 steps)\n\n            Segment 2: 10 to 9: \n                (9-10)%10 = -1 %10 = 9 -> steps: 10->1->2->...->9: 9 steps? \n                But wait: from 10 to 9: clockwise: 10->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that's 9 steps.\n\n            Segment 3: 9 to 8: (8-9)%10 = -1 %10 = 9 -> 9 steps.\n\n            So total steps = 9 + 9*9 = 9 + 81 = 90.\n\n            But wait, we can simulate:\n\n                Start at 1.\n                Go to 10: 9 steps (time=9)\n                Then from 10 to 9: 9 steps (time=18)\n                Then from 9 to 8: 9 steps (time=27)\n                Then from 8 to 7: 9 steps (time=36)\n                Then from 7 to 6: 9 steps (time=45)\n                Then from 6 to 5: 9 steps (time=54)\n                Then from 5 to 4: 9 steps (time=63)\n                Then from 4 to 3: 9 steps (time=72)\n                Then from 3 to 2: 9 steps (time=81)\n                Then from 2 to 1: 9 steps (time=90)\n\n            So 90 is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the tasks are not in decreasing order? \n\n        Example: n=10, tasks=[1,2,3,...,10] \n\n            Start at 1.\n\n            Segment 1: 1 to 1: 0\n            Segment 2: 1 to 2: (2-1)%10=1\n            Segment 3: 2 to 3: (3-2)%10=1\n            ...\n            Segment 10: 9 to 10: (10-9)%10=1\n\n            Total time = 0 + 1*9 = 9.\n\n            Actual: \n                Start at 1, then no move for first task, then move from 1 to 2 (1 step), 2 to 3 (1 step), ... 9 to 10 (1 step). Total 9 steps.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        But wait: note that the modulus operation is defined for negative, and the inputs are positive, so we are safe.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined even if a and b are positive and a-b is negative.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total = 0\n            for a in arr:\n                total += (a - current) % n\n                current = a\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait: wait, wait! There's a mistake in the modulus operation.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=1, a=3 -> (3-1)%4 = 2, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=3, a=2 -> (2-3)%4 = -1%4 = 3, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=2, a=3 -> (3-2)%4=1, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, a=1 -> (1-4)%4 = -3%4 = 1, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, a=2 -> (2-4)%4 = -2%4 = 2, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, a=3 -> (3-4)%4 = -1%4=3, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, a=4 -> 0, correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, a=5 -> but wait, a is between 1 and n, so no.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says that the ringroad has n houses, and we are moving from house to house. The modulus operation is giving the clockwise distance, which is the number of edges we traverse.\n\n        Therefore, we output the total.\n\n        But wait: the example input format: \n            The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). \n            The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).\n\n        We are reading the second line as a list of m integers.\n\n        Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n            Our code: \n                n=4, m=3, arr=[3,2,3]\n                total=0, current=1\n                a=3: total += (3-1)%4 = 2 -> total=2, current=3\n                a=2: total += (2-3)%4 = 3 -> total=5, current=2\n                a=3: total += (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total=6 -> print(6)\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n            Our code: \n                n=4, m=3, arr=[2,3,3]\n                total=0, current=1\n                a=2: total += (2-1)%4 = 1 -> total=1, current=2\n                a=3: total += (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total=2, current=3\n                a=3: total += 0 -> total=2 -> print(2)\n\n        Therefore, we output the correct answers.\n\n        However, wait: the example outputs are 6 and 2.\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus operation is not the best because we are accumulating the distances? \n\n        The problem does not require the minimal path overall, but the path that goes through the tasks in order. And the modulus operation gives the exact steps for each segment.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The ringroad has `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n`, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise along the ringroad. The distance between two houses `x` and `y` in a clockwise direction is calculated as `(y - x) % n`. This formula works because if `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the distance is simply `y - x`. If `y` is less than `x`, the distance is `(n - x) + y`, which simplifies to `(y - x) % n` due to modular arithmetic properties.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task's required house, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the next task's house using the modulus operation, and accumulate the total time taken for these moves. The current position is updated after each task to the task's house.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, performing a constant-time modulus operation for each. With `m` tasks, the time complexity is O(m), which is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor a in arr:\n    total += (a - current) % n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of houses where each task needs to be performed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 (`current = 1`) with a total time of 0 (`total = 0`).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task's required house `a`:\n   - Calculate the clockwise distance from `current` to `a` using `(a - current) % n`. This handles both cases where `a` is ahead or behind `current` in the circular road.\n   - Add this distance to the total time and update the current position to `a`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
