There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) or even try to use brute-force with state space reduction.\n However, note that the restrictions are given as intervals and we have multiple restrictions. We need to assign heights to each spot (from 0 to h) such that for every restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n One idea: sort the restrictions by x_i (the maximum allowed height). Then, we can use a constraint that propagates from left to right.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP with state (i, last_heights) but the state space might be too large.\n\n Another idea: since n, m, h are small (<=50), we can consider iterating over possible heights and using the restrictions to enforce constraints.\n\n However, note that the restrictions are independent and overlapping. We need to satisfy all of them.\n\n Let's reframe: Each house i can have a height a_i in [0, h]. The profit is sum(a_i^2).\n\n Constraints: For each restriction (l, r, x): max{ a_j for j from l to r } <= x.\n\n We can try to use an approach similar to \"minimum requirement\" but here we have maximum limits.\n\n Idea: \n 1. We note that the profit function is separable (each house is squared) and the constraints are on contiguous segments.\n\n 2. We can use the following: \n    - Without any restrictions, the best for each house is to set it to h (since h^2 >= k^2 for any k<=h).\n    - But the restrictions might force some houses to be lower.\n\n 3. We can try to process the restrictions. Since there are only 50 spots and 50 restrictions, we can use a greedy propagation? But note: we want to maximize the profit.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a state representation that considers the current spot and the current maximum height from the last few spots? But the constraints are arbitrary intervals.\n\n 5. Another idea: use constraint satisfaction. But 50^50 states is too many.\n\n 6. Since n is at most 50, but h is also at most 50, and m is at most 50, we can use a different approach.\n\n Observation: The restrictions are given as (l, r, x). We can first extract the most restrictive constraint for each segment? Actually, we can combine the constraints: if two constraints overlap, then the height must be at most the minimum x_i in the overlapping region.\n\n However, the problem is that the same house may be constrained by multiple restrictions. So for each house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover house i.\n\n But wait: that is not necessarily true. Consider: \n   Restriction1: [1,3] -> x1\n   Restriction2: [2,4] -> x2\n   Then house 2 must be <= min(x1, x2). Similarly, house 3 must be <= min(x1, x2) for the two restrictions that cover it? Actually, yes, because the restriction1 says the whole segment [1,3] must be <= x1, and restriction2 says [2,4] must be <= x2, so house 3 must be <= x1 and <= x2.\n\n So step 1: For each house i, let c_i = minimum x_j among all restrictions j that cover i. Then the house i must be built at most c_i. But note: what if no restriction covers house i? Then c_i would be infinity? Actually, we have the global constraint that the house cannot exceed h. And the problem says: \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" So without any restriction, the house can be up to h.\n\n However, note: the example input does not give a global constraint beyond h. But the restrictions might not cover some houses. Then the house can be up to h. \n\n But wait: what if a house is not covered by any restriction? Then we can set it to h.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes the restrictions might imply that even if a house is not directly restricted, the constraint from a neighboring segment might require it to be lower? Actually, no. Because the constraints are independent per segment. The only constraints are the ones explicitly given and the global h.\n\n However, consider: \n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=1\n   Restriction2: [3,4] with x=1\n   Then house 1 can be up to 1, house 2 up to 1, house 3 up to 1, house 4 up to 1.\n\n But what if we have:\n   Restriction1: [1,3] with x=2, and no other restrictions. Then houses 1,2,3 can be up to 2.\n\n So for each house i, we define:\n   base[i] = min( { x_j | j: such that [l_j, r_j] covers i } )   if there is at least one restriction covering i, otherwise base[i] = h.\n\n However, wait: is that sufficient? Consider: \n   Restriction1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction2: [2,4] with x=3\n   Then for house 2: base[2] = min(2,3)=2, which is correct.\n\n But now, consider a more complex scenario: \n   We have two restrictions: \n        Restriction1: [1,4] with x=2\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=3\n   Then house 1: min(2,3)=2 -> correct because [1,4] requires <=2.\n   House 2: min(2,3)=2 -> correct.\n\n So the above definition is correct: the house i must be at most the minimum x_j of all restrictions that cover i. \n\n However, note: the problem says that the tallest house in a segment must be at most x_i. This is a condition on the entire segment. But if we set each house independently to the minimum x_j that covers it, then the condition for a segment [l, r] with x_i is automatically satisfied because each house j in [l, r] is set to at most x_i (since the restriction j covering [l, r] has x_i, and there might be others but we take the minimum, so the house j is set to at most x_i).\n\n But wait: what if we set a house to a value lower than the minimum? Then we are not maximizing the profit. We want to set each house to the maximum allowed by the constraints.\n\n However, the above base[i] gives an upper bound for house i. Then the optimal for house i is to set it to base[i] (unless base[i] is negative, but x_i>=0). \n\n But wait: is that always true? Let's check:\n\n   Profit is the sum of squares. Since the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers, we want to set each house to the maximum allowed value to maximize the square. However, note: the constraints are independent per house? \n\n However, consider: \n   Two restrictions: \n        [1,2] with x=1, and [2,3] with x=2.\n   Then base[1]=1, base[2]=min(1,2)=1, base[3]=2.\n\n   Then we set house1=1, house2=1, house3=2. \n   Profit: 1+1+4=6.\n\n   Is there a better way? \n        If we set house2=2, then the first restriction [1,2] would require the tallest house in [1,2] <=1, but house2=2 violates that. So we cannot set house2 to 2.\n\n   So the above method works.\n\n But wait: what if the constraints interact in a more complicated way? \n\n Example from the problem: \n   First example: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: \n            [1,1] with x=1 -> base[1]=1\n            [2,2] with x=3 -> base[2]=3\n            [3,3] with x=2 -> base[3]=2\n\n        Then we set: \n            house1=1, house2=3, house3=2 -> profit=1+9+4=14.\n\n   Second example: \n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: \n            [2,3] with x=8 -> base[2]=min(inf,8)=8, base[3]=min(8,7)=7 (but wait, second restriction [3,4] with x=7)\n            base[1]=10 (no restriction), base[2]=min(8, ...) actually the second restriction doesn't cover house2? \n            Correction: the second restriction [3,4] does not cover house2. So base[2]=8 (only the first restriction). \n            base[3]=min(8,7)=7, base[4]=7.\n\n        Then set: \n            house1=10, house2=8, house3=7, house4=7 -> profit=10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   This matches.\n\n However, wait: what if a house is covered by two restrictions with different x? Then we take the minimum, which is correct.\n\n But note: the problem statement says \"The i-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". \n\n The above method sets each house independently to the minimum x_i that covers it. This ensures that in any segment [l_i, r_i], the maximum height is at most x_i (because each house in the segment is at most x_i, so the maximum is at most x_i). \n\n Therefore, the solution is: \n   Step 1: Read n, h, m.\n   Step 2: Initialize an array base[0..n-1] (for houses 1-indexed) with base[i] = h (if no restriction) but wait, initially set to h (the global maximum). Then, for each restriction, update the base for houses from l_i to r_i to the minimum of the current base and x_i.\n\n   However, wait: we are taking the minimum of the current base and x_i. But initially base is set to h. Then, when processing a restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), we set for each house j in [l_i, r_i]:\n        base[j] = min(base[j], x_i)\n\n   This is correct because the house j must be at most x_i (from this restriction) and we already set it to the minimum of all restrictions so far and the initial h.\n\n   But note: if a house is not covered by any restriction, then base[j] remains h, which is allowed.\n\n   Then, the maximum profit is the sum for i=1 to n of (base[i])^2? \n\n   However, wait: is that the maximum? \n\n   Consider: maybe we don't have to set each house to the maximum allowed (base[i])? Because if we set a house to a lower value, then we might relax the constraints for adjacent segments? \n\n   But note: the constraints are independent. Each house i must be <= base[i] (because of the restrictions). And setting it to base[i] gives the maximum profit (since base[i]^2 is the maximum we can get for house i). \n\n   However, there is a catch: the constraints are defined on contiguous segments, and sometimes a house might be forced to be lower because of a segment constraint that includes multiple houses. But note: our base[i] is the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover house i. And we are allowed to set house i to base[i] and still satisfy all restrictions that cover it.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is simply: for each house i, set it to base[i] (which is the minimum x_i of all restrictions covering i, or h if none) and then compute the sum of squares.\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        base[1]=min(1) = 1\n        base[2]=min(3) = 3\n        base[3]=min(2)=2\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2:\n        base[1]=10 (no restriction)\n        base[2]=min(8) [from [2,3]] -> 8\n        base[3]=min(8,7)=7\n        base[4]=7\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if there is a restriction that forces a house to be lower, but we can set it higher because the segment constraint is satisfied by other houses? \n\n   Let me clarify: the constraint for a segment [l, r] is that the maximum height in that segment is <= x. \n\n   Our base[i] is computed as the minimum x from all restrictions covering i. \n\n   But note: if we set house i to base[i], then for any segment [l, r] that has a restriction (with x=x0) and that covers house i, we have base[i] <= x0. However, the segment [l, r] might have a house j that is set to base[j] (which is <= x0) and the maximum in the segment is the maximum of base[i] for i in [l, r]. \n\n   But wait: is the maximum in the segment [l, r] necessarily <= x0? \n\n   We know that for each house i in [l, r], base[i] <= x0 (because the restriction says that the house i must be <= x0, and base[i] is the minimum of all restrictions including the one with x0). \n\n   Therefore, the maximum in the segment is <= x0.\n\n   So the assignment is valid.\n\n   But is it the maximum profit? \n\n   Yes, because for each house i, we set it to the maximum allowed (base[i]), and the square is maximized for each house independently.\n\n   However, wait: what if we set one house to less than base[i] to allow another house to be set higher? \n\n   Example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=1\n        Restriction: [1,2] with x=5.\n\n        Then base[1]=5, base[2]=5.\n\n        Profit = 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n        But if we set house1=4 and house2=5, then the segment [1,2] has maximum 5 (still satisfies) and profit=16+25=41, which is worse.\n\n        Or if we set house1=5 and house2=4, same.\n\n        What if we set house1=3 and house2=5? Then the segment [1,2] has maximum 5, but profit=9+25=34, worse.\n\n        So we cannot do better.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x=5\n\n        Then base[1]=5, base[2]=5 -> profit=50.\n\n        Alternatively, set house1=5, house2=5 -> 50.\n\n        But if we set house1=5 and house2=5, that's the maximum.\n\n   However, consider a scenario where two restrictions interact:\n\n        n=2, h=10, m=1\n        Restriction: [1,2] with x=5.\n\n        Then base[1]=5, base[2]=5 -> profit=50.\n\n        Now, if we set house1=3, house2=5, then the segment [1,2] is still <=5, but the profit is 9+25=34, which is less.\n\n        But note: the profit is additive, and we are not constrained to set houses to the base[i] arbitrarily. The base[i] is the maximum allowed for house i. \n\n        However, the catch: the constraints are on the entire segment. In the above example, we could set house1 to 10 if there were no restriction? But wait, the restriction [1,2] says the entire segment must be <=5, so house1 cannot be 10. \n\n        So the base[i] is the maximum allowed for house i due to all restrictions.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Step 1: Initialize base = [h]*(n+1)   # 1-indexed, index from 1 to n\n        Step 2: For each of the m restrictions (each given by l, r, x):\n                for i from l to r:\n                    base[i] = min(base[i], x)\n\n        Step 3: Compute profit = 0\n                 for i from 1 to n:\n                     profit += base[i] * base[i]\n\n        Step 4: Print profit.\n\n   But wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions? Our base[i] is updated by the minimum x from the restrictions that cover i.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over all restrictions and updating base[i] to the minimum x that appears in any restriction covering i. \n\n   But is that correct? \n\n        Example: \n          Restriction1: [1,2] x=5\n          Restriction2: [1,2] x=3\n\n          Then for house1: \n            Initially base[1]=10.\n            After Restriction1: base[1]=min(10,5)=5.\n            After Restriction2: base[1]=min(5,3)=3.\n\n          Similarly for house2.\n\n        That's correct.\n\n   However, consider: \n          Restriction1: [1,2] x=5\n          Restriction2: [2,3] x=3\n\n          Then for house2: \n            Initially base[2]=10.\n            After Restriction1: base[2]=min(10,5)=5.\n            After Restriction2: base[2]=min(5,3)=3.\n\n        Then house2 is set to 3.\n\n        Now, check the segment [1,2]: maximum is max(base[1], base[2]) = max(5,3)=5 -> okay (restriction1 allows 5).\n        Check the segment [2,3]: maximum is max(base[2], base[3]) = max(3, base[3]) -> base[3] was updated by Restriction2: initially 10, then min(10,3)=3. So max(3,3)=3 -> okay.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: what if the restrictions are not applied in order? We update base[i] with the minimum of the current base[i] and the x of the restriction. Since the minimum is taken, the order doesn't matter.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        base = [h] * (n+1)   # 0-indexed we won't use index0, we use 1..n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            # update the base for houses from l to r\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if base[i] > x_val:\n                    base[i] = x_val\n\n        total_profit = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            total_profit += base[i] * base[i]\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n   However, wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then base[i] remains h for all i, and profit = n * h^2.\n\n   Example: n=3, h=3, m=0 -> profit = 3*9=27.\n\n   But the example input had m=3.\n\n   But wait: the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        Our code: \n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            base = [3,3,3,3] (index0 unused, then indices 1,2,3)\n\n            Process restriction1: l=1, r=1, x_val=1 -> base[1]=min(3,1)=1\n            Process restriction2: l=2, r=2, x_val=3 -> base[2]=min(3,3)=3\n            Process restriction3: l=3, r=3, x_val=2 -> base[3]=min(3,2)=2\n\n            Then total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the maximum height is h (so h=3) and the restrictions can be as low as 0. Our code uses the minimum of the base and the restriction.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the house must be between 0 and h. Our base[i] is at least 0? \n\n        Since x_val can be 0, then base[i] can become 0.\n\n   Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1\n        Restriction: [1,1] x=0\n\n        Then base[1]=0, profit=0.\n\n   But wait: is that allowed? The problem says the house can be built with an integer height between 0 and h. So 0 is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the above solution seems to work.\n\n   However, wait: is it possible that by setting a house to a value lower than the base[i] we can get more profit overall? \n\n   Let me think: the profit is the sum of squares. The square function is convex and increasing for nonnegative numbers. Therefore, for each house, the maximum profit we can get from that house is by setting it to the maximum allowed value (base[i]). \n\n   Therefore, we should set each house to base[i] to maximize its own contribution, and the constraints are independent per house (because the base[i] already incorporates all the restrictions that cover house i). \n\n   But wait, what if two houses are connected by a constraint? \n\n        Example: two houses with a constraint [1,2] with x=5. Then base[1]=5, base[2]=5. \n        Setting both to 5 gives 5^2+5^2=50.\n        If we set house1=4 and house2=5, then the constraint [1,2] is still satisfied (max=5) but the profit is 16+25=41, which is less.\n\n        Similarly, if we set house1=5 and house2=4, same.\n\n        What if we set house1=3 and house2=5? Then the constraint is satisfied (max=5) and profit=9+25=34, which is less.\n\n        So we cannot improve by lowering one house.\n\n        Why? Because the square function grows faster for larger numbers. \n\n        Therefore, the solution is indeed to set each house to base[i].\n\n   However, note: the above reasoning is for independent houses. But the constraints are on contiguous segments. \n\n        But note: the base[i] is the minimum x from all restrictions covering i, and we are allowed to set house i to base[i] without violating any constraint (as argued earlier). \n\n        And since the square function is increasing and convex, we want to set each house to the maximum allowed (base[i]).\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, let me check with the provided examples and the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample input 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" -> output 14.\n\n   Sample input 2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\" -> output 262.\n\n   However, wait: the second sample input: \n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        base = [10,10,10,10] initially.\n\n        First restriction: [2,3] with 8 -> update base[2]=min(10,8)=8, base[3]=min(10,8)=8.\n        Second restriction: [3,4] with 7 -> update base[3]=min(8,7)=7, base[4]=min(10,7)=7.\n\n        Then base[1]=10, base[2]=8, base[3]=7, base[4]=7.\n\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        base = [h] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed, we ignore index0\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            for j in range(l, r+1):\n                if base[j] > x_val:\n                    base[j] = x_val\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            total += base[i] * base[i]\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: the problem says there are m restrictions, and we are reading m lines.\n\n   However, note: the input format: \n        The first line: n, h, m\n        Then m lines, each with three integers.\n\n   But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is a list of two strings, each string being a test case.\n\n   How do we run the code? \n\n        We assume standard input.\n\n   Since the problem is competitive programming, we read from stdin.\n\n   But note: the input might have multiple test cases? The problem says: \"The first line contains three integers\", so one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two separate test cases in the example? Actually, the example input is two separate inputs. \n\n   The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"Print a single integer\".\n\n   So we assume one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings in a list. \n\n   Actually, the problem statement example input is:\n\n        Input:\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But this is just an example. In the actual competition, there is one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples. But the code must handle one test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" and we have one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we read one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two separate test cases in the example? Actually, the example input is two separate examples. \n\n   The problem says: \"You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\"\n\n   And then the example input is:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n            Output: 14\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n            Output: 262\n\n   So we must write code that reads one test case.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input is described.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, so we can read one test case.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as two strings? Actually, the example input is two separate test cases. \n\n   Let me read the problem again: the input format is as described.\n\n   The problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m ... Each of the next m lines ...\"\n\n   So the input is one test case.\n\n   But the example input is two separate test cases. \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is just a representation of two examples.\n\n   Therefore, we assume that the input is one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so we output one integer per test case.\n\n   Since the problem says there is one test case, we output one integer.\n\n   But wait: what if the problem intended to have multiple test cases? \n\n   The problem statement does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the constraints are small, and the input format is fixed, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the sample input is two test cases? Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples. \n\n   However, the example input format is:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3 3\n            1 1 1\n            2 2 3\n            3 3 2\n\n        Output:\n            14\n\n        And separately:\n\n        Input:\n            4 10 2\n            2 3 8\n            3 4 7\n\n        Output:\n            262\n\n   So the code should handle one test case.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\" and then m lines. So we read until we have processed m lines.\n\n   The code above does that.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as two separate strings. In practice, the input is provided from stdin.\n\n   Let me run the code with the first example:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3 3\n            1 1 1\n            2 2 3\n            3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n   Second example:\n\n        Input:\n            4 10 2\n            2 3 8\n            3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   But wait: is there a possibility that the same house is covered by two restrictions that conflict? \n\n        Example: \n            Restriction1: [1,2] x=5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] x=3\n\n        Then base[1]=3, base[2]=3. \n\n        Now, what if we have:\n\n            Restriction1: [1,2] x=5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] x=4\n\n        Then base[1]=4, base[2]=4.\n\n        But then the segment [1,2] must be at most 4 (from the second restriction) and 5 (from the first) -> the stricter one is 4, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the restrictions are independent. Our solution is to set each house to the minimum of the restrictions and the global h.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the house must be set to the minimum? We set it to the minimum because that is the maximum allowed. And that gives the maximum profit.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h. Our base[i] is at most h (because we start with h and then take min with x_val which is between 0 and h). So base[i] is between 0 and h.\n\n   This satisfies the requirement.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        base = [h] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed, index 0 unused\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if base[i] > x_val:\n                    base[i] = x_val\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            total += base[i] * base[i]\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the example input might have the restrictions in any order? Our code updates base[i] regardless of the order. Since we are taking the minimum, the order does not matter.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" -> outputs 14.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\" -> outputs 262.\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: \"1 10 1\\n1 1 5\" -> base[1]=5, profit=25.\n\n   Example 4: \n        Input: \"2 10 1\\n1 2 5\" -> base[1]=5, base[2]=5, profit=50.\n\n   Example 5: \n        Input: \"2 10 2\\n1 1 5\\n2 2 3\" -> base[1]=5, base[2]=3, profit=25+9=34.\n\n   Example 6: \n        Input: \"2 10 2\\n1 2 5\\n1 2 3\" -> base[1]=min(10,5,3)=3, base[2]=3, profit=18.\n\n   All these seem correct.\n\n   But wait: in Example 5, the two restrictions are independent. The first restricts house1 to 5, the second restricts house2 to 3. Then the entire street has two houses: [5,3] and the maximum in the entire street? There is no restriction that covers the entire street, but we don't require that. We only have two restrictions: [1,1] and [2,2]. So the maximum in [1,1] is 5, and in [2,2] is 3, so both restrictions are satisfied.\n\n   Example 6: two restrictions: [1,2] with 5 and [1,2] with 3. Then the entire segment [1,2] must be at most 3 (because the second restriction is 3, and the first is 5, but the stricter one is 3). Then base[1]=min(10,5,3)=3, base[2]=3.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says that the restrictions are given as (l_i, r_i, x_i). We are updating base[i] for every house i in the segment [l_i, r_i] to the minimum of the current base[i] and x_i. \n\n   This is correct because the house i must be at most x_i (from this restriction) and we are keeping the minimum of all such x_i.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the house can be built with an integer height between 0 and h. Our base[i] is set to the minimum of the restrictions and h. However, note that the restrictions' x_i are between 0 and h, so base[i] is at most h. And we set base[i] to at least 0 (if a restriction sets it to 0). \n\n   Therefore, the house height is in [0, h] (if we set base[i] to the minimum, and the minimum is at least 0, then we are good).\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        base = [h] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed, index 0 is unused\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l, r+1):\n                if base[j] > x_val:\n                    base[j] = x_val\n\n        total_profit = 0\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            total_profit += base[j] * base[j]\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all restrictions that apply to its spot, and the goal is to set each house's height to the maximum allowed value to maximize its contribution to the total profit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that each house's height does not exceed the most restrictive value from any zoning restriction covering its spot. The profit function is separable, meaning the total profit is the sum of individual house profits (each being the square of its height). \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the minimum value of all restrictions that include that house. This is because each restriction imposes an upper bound on the house's height, and the strictest (smallest) bound must be respected.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an array `base` where each element is set to the global maximum height `h`.\n   - For each zoning restriction, update the `base` array for all houses in the specified range to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height limit.\n   - After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the values in the `base` array.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each house in its range. With `n` houses and `m` restrictions, each potentially affecting up to `n` houses, the time complexity is O(m*n), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nbase = [h] * (n + 1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if base[i] > x_val:\n            base[i] = x_val\n\ntotal_profit = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total_profit += base[i] * base[i]\n\nprint(total_profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `base` array is initialized with the global maximum height `h` for each house (index 0 is unused for simplicity).\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code scans the specified range of houses and updates their `base` values to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height limit. This ensures each house's height adheres to all applicable restrictions.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, the total profit is computed by summing the squares of the heights in the `base` array. This leverages the fact that setting each house's height to its maximum allowable value maximizes its individual profit contribution.\n4. **Output**: The computed total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently enforces all zoning restrictions while maximizing the profit by leveraging simple array operations and a clear understanding of the problem constraints.",
