The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of rounds `n`, then two strings A and B (the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that each player uses a cyclic sequence. Therefore, the entire game can be broken down into cycles of length L = lcm(m, k) or even we can consider the periodicity of pairs (i, j) from A and B.\n\n However, note: In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n The outcome of a round is determined by the pair (A[i % m], B[i % k]). We need to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over n rounds.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute the outcome for each pair (a, b) where a in ['R','S','P'] and b in ['R','S','P'].\n\n    According to the rules:\n        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S): so if a='R' and b='S' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P): so if a='S' and b='P' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n        Paper (P) beats Rock (R): so if a='P' and b='R' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n\n    Otherwise (if they are the same or the other way around):\n        If a == b: draw.\n        Else: \n            If a wins against b? Actually, if it's not a win for Nikephoros, then Polycarpus wins (so the reverse rules).\n\n    Alternatively, we can define:\n\n    Let outcome(a, b) be:\n        if a == b: 0 (draw)\n        else:\n            if (a, b) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then 1 (Nikephoros wins) -> meaning Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n            else: -1 (Polycarpus wins) -> meaning Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n    But wait: in the example, when P vs S: P is Nikephoros's move and S is Polycarpus's move. Then according to the rules, P (paper) beats R (rock) but not S? Actually, no: the rule is:\n        Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.\n\n    So:\n        R vs S: R wins -> but wait, our example input: \n            Input: \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\"\n            Round 1: R vs R -> draw.\n            Round 2: P vs S -> P (paper) vs S (scissors): paper does NOT beat scissors. Actually, the rule says scissors beats paper. So here, P (paper) is beaten by S (scissors). Therefore, in this round, Polycarpus wins (because he showed S which beats P) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n\n    Correction: the example says: \n        Round 2: P - S -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n    So actually, the outcome is determined by:\n\n        a = 'P', b = 'S': since 'P' is paper and 'S' is scissors, and the rule is that scissors beats paper, so b wins -> Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n    Therefore, we can define:\n\n        if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs for Nikephoros: [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a red spot).\n        Otherwise, if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs for Polycarpus: [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros gets a red spot).\n        And if a==b, then no one gets a red spot.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think:\n\n        Define a function that returns:\n            1 if Nikephoros wins (so add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots)\n            -1 if Polycarpus wins (so add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots)\n            0 for draw.\n\n    But note: the problem asks for the total red spots on both players.\n\n    Actually, we can count separately:\n\n        For each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets one red spot.\n        If Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros gets one red spot.\n\n    So we don't need negative numbers, we can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the outcome without simulating each round individually due to the large constraint on `n` (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The key observation is that the sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes also repeat in a periodic manner.\n2. **Insight**: The periodicity of outcomes can be determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. However, directly computing LCM for large `n` is impractical. Instead, we analyze all possible pairs of moves (from the two sequences) and count how many times each pair results in a win for one player or a draw.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Precompute Outcomes**: For each possible pair of moves (from the two sequences), determine the winner or if it's a draw. This helps in mapping each unique pair to its outcome.\n   - **Count Unique Cycles**: For each unique combination of indices (i, j) in the sequences, calculate how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and the remaining rounds. Multiply the outcomes by the number of occurrences of each pair.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The complexity is O(m*k), where m and k are the lengths of the sequences (up to 1000 each), making it feasible even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    def outcome(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return 0\n        elif (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 1  # Polycarpus gets a red spot (since Nikephoros wins)\n        else:\n            return -1  # Nikephoros gets a red spot (Polycarpus wins)\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    total_red_nike = 0\n    total_red_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(k):\n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j]\n            res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n            if res == 1:\n                poly_count = 0\n                while n >= 0:\n                    if (i * (k + poly_count)) % m == i and (j * (m + poly_count)) % k == j:\n                        break\n                    poly_count += 1\n                cycles = (n) // poly_count\n                rem = n % poly_count\n                total_red_poly += cycles\n                for r in range(rem + 1):\n                    if outcome(A[(i + r) % m], B[(j + r) % k]) == 1:\n                        total_red_poly += 1\n            elif res == -1:\n                nike_count = 0\n                while n >= 0:\n                    if (i * (k + nike_count)) % m == i and (j * (m + nike_count)) % k == j:\n                        break\n                    nike_count += 1\n                cycles = (n) // nike_count\n                rem = n % nike_count\n                total_red_nike += cycles\n                for r in range(rem + 1):\n                    if outcome(A[(i + r) % m], B[(j + r) % k]) == -1:\n                        total_red_nike += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_red_nike} {total_red_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Outcome Function**: This function checks the result of a round based on the two moves: if they are the same, it's a draw; otherwise, it checks which move wins according to the game rules.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: For each unique pair of moves (one from each sequence), the code calculates how many full cycles of these moves occur in `n` rounds. It then processes any remaining rounds after these full cycles.\n4. **Counting Red Spots**: Depending on whether the outcome of a pair is a win for Nikephoros or Polycarpus, the respective player's red spot count is incremented by the number of occurrences of that pair in the played rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
