            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. Each string is of the form \"digit suit\", but note: the input is three separate strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" and each tile is represented by two characters.\n\n However, looking at the example, it seems the input is given as one line with three space-separated strings? Actually, the example input format is not clear.\n\n Let me re-read: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n But then the example input is shown as:\n   Input: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This doesn't look right. Actually, the problem says: \"the only line\", so we have one line of input. And the three tiles are given as three strings? Or as three tokens?\n\n Let me check the example again:\n\n Example Input:\n     1s 2s 3s\n     9m 9m 9m\n     3p 9m 2p\n\n But wait, the example output is given as:\n     ['0','0','1']\n\n So probably, the input is one line with three strings (each string being a tile). But wait, the example input is shown as three separate strings in an array. Actually, the problem statement says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n However, the example input is written as:\n\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n That might be just the way the example is presented. In reality, the input will be a single line with three strings, each string being a two-character string (each tile) OR three tiles separated by spaces?\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the only line contains three strings\". Each string is a tile? Then each tile is two characters. So the entire line would have three two-character strings? Then the total length of the line is 6 (if no spaces) but they are separated by spaces.\n\n Actually, let me read the problem again: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ...\". So each tile is represented by a string of two characters. Then the input has three such strings. How are they separated?\n\n The example input is written as three separate strings in a list. But the problem says \"The only line\", meaning one line of input. So we must read one line and then split it appropriately.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as:\n\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing. Alternatively, the problem might mean that the input is three tiles, each given as a two-character string, and these three are provided in one line, separated by spaces.\n\n Since the problem says \"three strings\", and each string is two characters, then the input could be:\n\n     \"1s2s3s\"   -> but then we don't know how to split.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from 1 to 9).\" and they represent it as \"digit\" + suit_letter.\n\n So each tile is two characters. There are three tiles. Therefore, the input line will have six characters, but they are grouped into three groups (each two characters) and separated by spaces? Or no spaces?\n\n The example input is shown as having spaces between the tiles. For example, the first example input is \"1s 2s 3s\", so there are spaces separating the three tiles.\n\n Therefore, we can read the input line and split it by spaces to get a list of three strings, each string is two characters.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split it. We should get three strings.\n\n 2. Count the frequency of each tile. Note: the tiles are identified by both the digit and the suit.\n\n 3. We have two types of mentsu: koutsu (triplet) and shuntsu (sequence).\n\n Conditions for a mentsu:\n\n   - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit).\n   - Shuntsu: three consecutive digits (n, n+1, n+2) in the same suit.\n\n But note: the hand has three tiles initially. We are allowed to draw extra tiles (minimum number) so that we have at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note that after drawing, we have more than three tiles. But the mentsu is formed by three tiles. So we need to check if we can form a mentsu with the existing tiles and possibly drawing one or two.\n\n But note: we can draw any tile arbitrarily. We are allowed to have duplicates. Also, the mentsu requires exactly three tiles.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n   Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n   Case 1: Not having a mentsu, but we can form one by drawing 1 tile.\n\n   Case 2: Not having a mentsu, and we cannot form one by drawing 1 tile, but we can by drawing 2 tiles.\n\n   Case 3: Even by drawing 2 tiles, we still cannot form a mentsu? Then we need 3? Actually, note that the problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we can win (i.e., have at least one mentsu).\n\n However, note: the hand initially has three tiles. After drawing k tiles, we have 3+k tiles.\n\n We are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. We can form multiple mentsu? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n How can we use the drawn tiles?\n\n Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n 0 draws: Check if the three tiles form a mentsu.\n\n 1 draw: Check if by adding one tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n 2 draws: Check if by adding two tiles we can form a mentsu.\n\n 3 draws: Actually, note: with four tiles, we can form a mentsu. But sometimes we might need three draws? However, consider:\n\n   - If we have three identical tiles, then we have a koutsu (so 0 draws). Otherwise, we might have two identical and one different.\n\n   However, note that we can also form a sequence by drawing one tile if we have two consecutive numbers and the third is missing, or if we have two of one number and one of the next, etc.\n\n But note: the problem allows us to draw any tile arbitrarily. We are allowed to form the mentsu from the entire hand (with the drawn tiles).\n\n However, note that we are only required to have one mentsu. The rest of the tiles don't matter.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let S be the set of initial three tiles.\n\n We are going to consider:\n\n 1. Check for 0 draws: \n      - Check for koutsu: any tile repeated three times? \n          But wait, we have three tiles. So if all three are the same, then we have a koutsu.\n\n      - Check for shuntsu: \n          Group by suit. For a given suit, if we have three consecutive numbers.\n\n 2. Check for 1 draw:\n\n      We can consider two cases:\n\n      Case A: Drawing a tile to complete a triplet.\n\n          For each distinct tile type (each distinct tile) that appears twice, then if we draw one more of that tile, we get a triplet.\n\n          However, what if we have two of one tile and one of another, but the two are the same and the third is different? Then drawing the same tile as the two will complete the triplet.\n\n          But note: the two must be of the same tile. So if we have [1m, 1m, 2m] then we can draw one more 1m to complete the triplet.\n\n      Case B: Drawing a tile to complete a sequence.\n\n          Consider sequences of three consecutive numbers in a given suit.\n\n          We have three tiles. They might be:\n\n            Option 1: Two tiles of the same suit and two consecutive numbers, and the third tile is of the same suit and one number away.\n\n          Actually, we can break down:\n\n          Let's group by suit.\n\n          For a given suit, let the distinct numbers present be considered. We have at most three tiles of that suit (if two suits appear, then one suit might have two and the other one).\n\n          We need to check for each suit:\n\n          Suppose in a suit we have:\n\n            Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] (three tiles, but we have only three tiles in total). Then we can complete the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing a 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing a 3m.\n\n          However, note: we can also form a sequence that uses two of the tiles and one drawn. \n\n          Conditions for forming a sequence with one draw:\n\n            - We have two consecutive numbers and the third consecutive is missing.\n\n            Specifically, for a suit, let the set of numbers be {a, b, c} (but we might have duplicates). We have to account for duplicates.\n\n          Actually, we can consider:\n\n            We have a multiset of numbers for a suit. We can use at most three tiles from that suit (since we have three tiles total). \n\n          Steps for a given suit:\n\n            Let the multiset for the suit be T (with frequencies). We can consider:\n\n            We are missing one tile to complete a sequence. The sequence is defined by three consecutive numbers.\n\n            How many sequences can we form? \n\n            We need three consecutive numbers. We have some numbers. We can use duplicates? Actually, no: the same tile cannot be used twice. So we have to consider distinct tiles.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. They might be repeated. But wait, the hand has three tiles. So if we have two of the same tile, then we have two copies of the same number and suit.\n\n            Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] for the suit m. Then we can form the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing a 3m, but we have two 1m's. We can use one 1m for the sequence. The other 1m is left. Similarly, we can also consider the sequence [0,1,2] but 0 doesn't exist.\n\n            Actually, we can use at most one occurrence per tile. So we have two 1m's. We can use one 1m for the sequence [1,2,3] and the other 1m is not part of the sequence.\n\n            But note: the definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles. So we need three distinct numbers (unless the same number is repeated? no, because the numbers must be consecutive). Actually, the numbers must be consecutive and distinct.\n\n            However, the same tile (same number and same suit) cannot be used twice.\n\n            So for a given suit, we have a multiset of numbers. We can use up to the count of each number, but each distinct number can be used at most once.\n\n            Now, we want to know: is there a set of three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) such that:\n\n                - The set {n, n+1, n+2} is contained in the available numbers (considering we have at least one copy for each) and we have at least one copy for each distinct number in the set.\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile. So we might be missing one number in the set.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n              Option 1: We already have two numbers of the set, and we are missing one. Then drawing the missing number (in the same suit) will complete the sequence.\n\n              Option 2: We have one number of the set, and we are missing two. Then we cannot complete the sequence with one draw.\n\n            However, note: the entire hand has three tiles. So we cannot have more than three tiles of the same suit (unless the other suits have negative? no, we have three tiles total). So we have to consider the distribution.\n\n            Actually, we are allowed to use one draw to complete the sequence. So we need to check for every suit and for every possible starting number n (from 1 to 7) the sequence (n, n+1, n+2). \n\n            For a given sequence (n, n+1, n+2):\n\n                Let the available numbers (for this suit) be the distinct numbers that appear at least once.\n\n                We require that we have at least two of the three numbers in the set {n, n+1, n+2}. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use duplicate tiles? No, because we can only use one copy of a tile. However, if we have duplicates, then we can use one copy of a number that appears twice. But the requirement is: the sequence must have three consecutive distinct numbers. So even if we have two copies of one number, we cannot use the same number twice.\n\n            Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> we have two 1m's. Then we can use one 1m and one 2m. The sequence [1,2,3] requires a 3m. We don't have 3m, so we need to draw 3m. But we have two 1m's and one 2m. The sequence [1,2,3] is formed by one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m.\n\n            However, we can also consider: [1m, 2m, 2m] -> then we have 1m and two 2m's. Then the sequence [1,2,3] requires 3m. We have 1m and two 2m's, so we can use one 2m. Then we need 3m.\n\n            But wait, what about the sequence [2,3,4]? We don't have 3m or 4m. So we cannot form [2,3,4] with one draw because we are missing two numbers.\n\n            So the condition for one draw for a sequence is: for a given sequence (n, n+1, n+2) and a given suit, we must have at least one tile for two of the numbers and we can draw the third.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. We are going to use three tiles for the sequence. But we have three tiles in total. So if we are going to use three tiles for the sequence, then the other suits don't matter? Actually, the hand has three tiles. If we use three tiles for the sequence, then we must have the three tiles for the sequence. But if we are missing one, then we draw one.\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile, and then we have four tiles. We don't require the entire hand to be the mentsu. We just require that the hand contains a mentsu (any three tiles). So we can have extra tiles.\n\n            However, when we draw one tile, we have four tiles. Then we can choose three of them to form the mentsu.\n\n            Therefore, we don't have to use all the tiles. We just need to have at least one mentsu.\n\n            So for the sequence case, we can consider:\n\n              We have three tiles. We can use any three of the four tiles (after drawing) to form the mentsu.\n\n            However, the drawn tile can be chosen arbitrarily. So we can choose the best one.\n\n            Therefore, to complete a sequence with one draw, we need to find a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) such that:\n\n                - The sequence is in one suit.\n\n                - We have at least two distinct numbers from the sequence (and they are in the same suit) and the two numbers are consecutive or with a gap of one.\n\n            Actually, we can have:\n\n                Case 1: We have two consecutive numbers (say a and a+1) and we are missing a+2. Then we draw a+2.\n\n                Case 2: We have two consecutive numbers (a and a+1) and we have an extra copy of a, but we also have a+2? Then we don't need to draw.\n\n            But wait, we are checking for 0 draws first. So if we already have a sequence, we return 0.\n\n            Now for 1 draw:\n\n                Condition for a sequence: There exists a suit and a number n (from 1 to 7) such that:\n\n                    We have at least one of n, n+1, n+2 (at least two of them) and the two we have are consecutive? Actually, we don't require the two we have to be consecutive. We just require that the set {n, n+1, n+2} has two elements present (and the suit matches) and we are missing one.\n\n                However, note: the two we have must be in the same suit, and they must be two distinct numbers (because the sequence requires distinct consecutive numbers). But they don't have to be consecutive? Actually, they can be non consecutive, but then we are missing two numbers. Then we cannot complete with one draw.\n\n                Example: We have [1m, 3m, 5m] (all in the same suit). Then we are missing 2m, 4m, and 6m is not in the sequence [1,2,3] or [3,4,5] or [5,6,7]. \n\n                For [3,4,5]: we have 3 and 5, so we are missing 4. Then we can draw 4m and form [3,4,5].\n\n                So the condition is: for the sequence (n, n+1, n+2), we have two of the three numbers (but they don't have to be consecutive) and they are in the same suit. Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n                However, what if we have duplicates? Example: [1m, 1m, 3m]. Then for the sequence [1,2,3]: we have two 1m and one 3m. We can use one 1m and the 3m, and we are missing 2m. Then we can draw 2m. But note: we have two 1m's. We can use one 1m, then we have one 1m left. The sequence [1,2,3] is valid.\n\n                So the condition is: for the sequence (n, n+1, n+2) and a suit, we have:\n\n                  Let the multiset of numbers for that suit be M.\n\n                  Then the number of distinct numbers in {n, n+1, n+2} that are present in M is at least 2.\n\n                However, wait: what if we have two copies of the same number? Then we have two distinct numbers? Actually, no: the distinct set of numbers we have in the hand for that suit is the set of distinct numbers. But we can use one copy per distinct number.\n\n                Actually, we don't care about duplicates for the sequence because the sequence requires distinct numbers. So we can ignore duplicates for the purpose of checking the distinct numbers.\n\n                Therefore, we can reduce the hand for a suit to a set of distinct numbers (but note: we might have two copies of a number, but that doesn't help for forming two different sequences).\n\n                However, duplicates might help if we are missing two numbers? Actually, no: because we can only use one copy of a tile.\n\n                But wait, duplicates can help in the following way: if we have two copies of a number that is part of two different sequences? Actually, no. We are only considering one sequence.\n\n                So for a given suit and a given sequence (n, n+1, n+2), we need to have at least two of the three numbers (distinct numbers) in the hand for that suit.\n\n            Example: \n                Hand: [1m, 1m, 2m] for suit m.\n                Sequence [1,2,3]: distinct numbers present: {1,2} -> two numbers, so we can complete by drawing 3m.\n\n                Hand: [1m, 2m, 4m] for suit m.\n                Sequence [1,2,3]: distinct numbers {1,2} -> two numbers, so we can complete by drawing 3m.\n                Sequence [2,3,4]: distinct numbers {2,4} -> two numbers, so we can complete by drawing 3m.\n\n                But note: we can only draw one tile. So we can choose the best sequence to complete.\n\n            However, what if we have two different sequences that can be completed by the same draw? Then we still only need one draw.\n\n            Therefore, for 1 draw (for sequence) we can do:\n\n                For each suit, and for each n from 1 to 7 (so that the sequence is (n, n+1, n+2) and n+2 <=9):\n\n                    Let S = {n, n+1, n+2}\n\n                    Let T = set of distinct numbers (ignoring duplicates) for that suit in the hand.\n\n                    If |T ∩ S| >= 2, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing number (which is the one in S but not in T) in that suit.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two different suits? We can only complete one sequence per suit. But note, the drawn tile must be in the suit of the sequence.\n\n            So if we have two different sequences in two different suits that can be completed by one draw, then we can only complete one of them. However, we are only drawing one tile. We can choose which one to draw. But we are only concerned with whether one draw is sufficient.\n\n            Therefore, if there exists at least one suit and one sequence (n, n+1, n+2) such that we have two distinct numbers from that sequence (in that suit) then one draw is sufficient.\n\n 3. Check for 2 draws:\n\n      There are several ways to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n      Possibility 1: Form a triplet.\n\n          We have two of a kind. Then we draw two more of that kind. So we can complete the triplet with two draws.\n\n          But wait, we can also complete a triplet by drawing one tile if we have two of a kind. So why two draws? \n\n          Actually, we are checking for 0 and 1 draws first. So if we didn't find 0 or 1, then we check 2.\n\n      Possibility 2: Form a sequence.\n\n          We have one tile of a number in a suit, and we need two more to complete a sequence.\n\n          Example: We have [1m, 4m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to complete [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. But wait, we can choose the best: actually, we have two gaps: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]. \n\n          However, we can also consider: we have [1m, 4m] and we draw 2m and 3m. Then we have the sequence [1,2,3] (we don't need 4m for that). But note: we have two draws.\n\n          But wait, is there a way to complete a sequence with two draws that is better? Actually, we can complete two different sequences, but we only need one.\n\n          However, note: we have three tiles. The third tile is not necessarily in the same suit. But we can ignore it.\n\n          Another example: We have [1m, 2p, 3s] (three different suits). Then we cannot form a sequence because we need same suit. So we must draw two tiles of the same suit as one of the existing ones? \n\n          Actually, we can choose the suit arbitrarily. We can draw two tiles of a new suit? But then we cannot form a sequence with the existing tiles because the existing tiles are in different suits.\n\n          But note: the problem allows drawing any tile. We can draw two tiles of the same suit as one of the existing ones, and then use that one and the two drawn to form a sequence.\n\n          Example: [1m, 2p, 3s] -> we can draw two 2m to form a triplet? Or two 1m to form a triplet? But wait, we don't have two of any. \n\n          Alternatively, we can draw two tiles to form a sequence in one of the suits. \n\n          For example, for the m tile (we have one 1m): we can draw 2m and 3m to form the sequence [1,2,3] in m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] and the other two tiles are 2p and 3s (which are irrelevant). \n\n          But wait, we have three tiles: [1m, 2p, 3s] and we draw two more: [2m,3m]. Then we have five tiles. We can pick [1m,2m,3m] to form the sequence.\n\n          Therefore, condition for two draws for a sequence: \n\n            There exists a suit such that we have at least one tile, and the set of distinct numbers in that suit has size 1 or 2, and the numbers we have are not consecutive and we are missing two consecutive numbers (or one gap that requires two numbers) such that by drawing two tiles we can complete a sequence.\n\n          Actually, we can break down:\n\n            We have a suit S and a set of distinct numbers T (for that suit). We want to know if we can complete a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) by drawing two tiles.\n\n            The sequence must be entirely in that suit.\n\n            We need to cover the entire sequence (n, n+1, n+2). We have some numbers from T. We need to draw the missing numbers.\n\n            The minimal number of draws for a particular sequence is: 3 - |T ∩ {n, n+1, n+2}|.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to choose the sequence arbitrarily (any n from 1 to 7). So we can choose the sequence that minimizes the number of draws.\n\n            Condition for two draws: There exists a suit and a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) such that the number of distinct numbers we have in that suit that are in the sequence is at most 1 (so we need to draw at least 2). \n\n            Actually, if we have 0 or 1 distinct numbers in the sequence, then we need to draw 3 - (number of distinct numbers we have in the sequence) tiles.\n\n            But note: we are limited by the fact that we can only use distinct numbers (so we cannot use the same tile twice). \n\n            However, we are allowed to draw any tile. So if we have one distinct number in the sequence, then we need to draw two more.\n\n            Example: We have one tile in a suit, say 1m. Then we can choose the sequence [1,2,3] and draw 2m and 3m. Then we have the sequence [1,2,3].\n\n            But wait, we have three tiles. The other two tiles are not in this suit. We don't care.\n\n            However, we must check: we have three tiles. We are drawing two, so we have five. But we can form the mentsu from the three tiles of the suit we are focusing on.\n\n            Therefore, for two draws for a sequence, we need to check: \n\n                There exists a suit and a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) such that the number of distinct numbers from {n, n+1, n+2} that are already present in that suit is at most 1.\n\n            But note: we might have two different sequences in the same suit? We can choose the best one.\n\n            However, we are only concerned with the minimal draws. So we can check for each suit and each sequence the number of distinct numbers we have.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: what is the maximum number of distinct numbers we can have in a sequence? We are allowed to draw two, so we need to have at most one distinct number in the sequence (then we need two draws) OR two distinct numbers but we are missing two numbers that are consecutive? Actually, no: if we have two distinct numbers, then we only need one draw (so that's the one-draw case). \n\n            Therefore, for two draws, we require that we have at most one distinct number in the sequence.\n\n            However, note: we might have two distinct numbers that are not consecutive. Then we need two draws. But wait, we can only complete the sequence if we have two consecutive numbers? Actually, no: we can complete the sequence by filling the gaps. \n\n            Example: We have two distinct numbers that are not consecutive, say 1m and 3m. Then the sequence [1,2,3] requires 2m. So we are missing one number (2m). Then we can complete with one draw. But wait, that's the one-draw case.\n\n            Therefore, the two-draw case for a sequence is when we have at most one distinct number in the sequence (so we need two draws) OR we have two distinct numbers that are consecutive? Then we can complete the sequence by drawing one tile (so that's one-draw). \n\n            Actually, no: if we have two consecutive numbers, then we are missing one (the third). Then we need one draw. So two-draw case must be when we have at most one distinct number in the sequence.\n\n            But wait, what if we have two distinct numbers that are not consecutive and we are missing two numbers? Then we need two draws.\n\n            Example: We have 1m and 4m. Then for the sequence [1,2,3]: we have 1, missing 2,3 -> two draws. But wait, we can choose a different sequence: [2,3,4] -> we have 4, missing 2,3 -> two draws. And [1,2,3] and [2,3,4] are the only two sequences that include 1 or 4.\n\n            But note: we can also consider a sequence that includes both 1 and 4? No, because 1 and 4 are not consecutive. The sequence must be three consecutive numbers.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for two draws for a sequence is: \n\n                There exists a suit and a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) such that the number of distinct numbers from {n, n+1, n+2} that we have in that suit is 0 or 1.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. Some of the tiles might be in multiple suits? Actually, no: a tile belongs to one suit.\n\n            But wait, what if we have two tiles in the same suit? Then we have two distinct numbers in that suit. Then we might complete a sequence with one draw (if the two distinct numbers are consecutive) or two draws (if they are not consecutive). \n\n            Example: [1m, 4m] (two tiles in suit m) and one tile in another suit. Then for the sequence [1,2,3] we have 1 -> we need two more (2,3). For [4,5,6] we have 4 -> we need two more (5,6). So two draws.\n\n            But if we have [1m, 3m] (two tiles in suit m) and one tile in another suit, then for the sequence [1,2,3] we have 1 and 3 -> missing 2. Then one draw.\n\n            Therefore, the two-draw case for a sequence is when we have at most one distinct number in the chosen sequence.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. The two tiles in the same suit might be two distinct numbers, and the third tile might be in a different suit. Then we consider the suit we have two tiles: we have two distinct numbers. Then we can complete the sequence in that suit by drawing one tile if the two numbers are consecutive, or two tiles if they are not consecutive.\n\n            But wait, the two numbers might not be consecutive, so we need two draws for that suit. However, we can choose a different sequence (in the same suit) that doesn't require the two numbers we have? \n\n            Example: [1m, 4m] in suit m. Then we have two distinct numbers: {1,4}. \n\n            Consider sequences in suit m:\n\n                [1,2,3]: we have 1, so we need 2 and 3 -> two draws.\n                [2,3,4]: we have 4, so we need 2 and 3 -> two draws.\n\n            So we need two draws.\n\n            Another example: [1m, 2m] (two consecutive) and one tile in another suit. Then for the sequence [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, so we need 3 -> one draw.\n\n            Therefore, for a given suit, we can compute the minimal number of draws needed to complete a sequence (by choosing the best sequence) as:\n\n                Let T = set of distinct numbers in that suit.\n\n                Then for each n from 1 to 7:\n\n                    Let S = {n, n+1, n+2}\n\n                    Let k = |T ∩ S|\n\n                    Then the number of draws needed for that sequence is 3 - k.\n\n                Then the minimal draws for that suit is min_{n=1..7} (3 - k)  [but only consider sequences where k>=0]\n\n            Then the minimal draws overall (for sequences) is the minimum over all suits of (min_{n} (3 - k)).\n\n            But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have one or two of a kind). \n\n            So overall, we need to consider:\n\n                Possibility 1: Triplet (koutsu)\n\n                    We can complete a triplet by drawing (3 - count) tiles, where count is the frequency of that tile.\n\n                    But note: we can choose the tile to duplicate. So we consider each distinct tile:\n\n                        Let tile x (with representation) have frequency f.\n\n                        Then draws needed = 3 - f.\n\n                    Then the minimal draws for a triplet is min_{x} (3 - f(x)).\n\n                Possibility 2: Sequence (shuntsu)\n\n                    As above.\n\n            Then the answer is the minimum over:\n\n                0 draws (if we already have a mentsu)\n                1 draw (if either a triplet can be completed by one draw or a sequence by one draw)\n                2 draws (if either a triplet can be completed by two draws or a sequence by two draws)\n                3 draws? Actually, note: the problem states that we can draw any tile arbitrarily, and we have three tiles initially. \n\n            But wait, the problem says: the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we can win. \n\n            However, note: the hand must have at least one mentsu. We have three tiles. We can form a mentsu by drawing 0, 1, 2, or maybe even 3? \n\n            But consider: if we have three tiles that are all in different suits and not consecutive, then:\n\n                Example: [1m, 1p, 1s] -> triplet: we have three different tiles. Wait, no: [1m, 1p, 1s] is not a triplet (because triplet requires same tile). \n\n                Actually, [1m, 1p, 1s] is not a triplet. Then we can try to form a triplet by drawing two more 1m (then we have three 1m and one 1p and one 1s) -> then we have a triplet.\n\n                Or we can form a sequence? We have three different suits. We cannot form a sequence because sequences require same suit.\n\n                So for [1m, 1p, 1s]:\n\n                    Triplet: we have one 1m, one 1p, one 1s -> so for 1m: 3-1=2 draws, similarly for 1p and 1s. So minimal triplet is 2 draws.\n\n                But wait, we can also form a sequence by drawing two tiles in one suit? \n\n                Example: for suit m, we have one 1m. Then we can draw two more tiles: 2m and 3m to form a sequence [1,2,3] in m. Then we need two draws.\n\n                So the minimal is 2.\n\n            However, is there a possibility that we can form a mentsu by drawing three tiles? \n\n            Actually, no: because with three draws we have six tiles, and we can always form a mentsu by making four of a kind (then we can remove one and have a triplet) or by making two sequences (but we don't need two, just one). However, the problem is asking the minimum.\n\n            But note: the minimal number of draws is at most 2? Actually, no: consider [1m, 2p, 3s] (three tiles, each in different suit and consecutive). Then:\n\n                Triplet: none, and we have one of each. So for triplet: 3-1=2 draws for each.\n\n                Sequence: we have one tile per suit. So for each suit, we have one tile. Then for a sequence, we need to draw two more for",
