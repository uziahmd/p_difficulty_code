The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of rounds `n`, then two strings A and B (the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that each player uses a cyclic sequence. Therefore, the entire game can be broken down into cycles of length L = lcm(m, k) or simply we can consider the periodicity of pairs (i, j) from the two sequences.\n\n However, note: In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n The outcome of a round is determined by the pair (A[i % m], B[i % k]). We need to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over n rounds.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute the outcome for each pair (a, b) where a in ['R','S','P'] and b in ['R','S','P'].\n\n    According to the rules:\n        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S): so if a='R' and b='S' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P): so if a='S' and b='P' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n        Paper (P) beats Rock (R): so if a='P' and b='R' -> Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses.\n\n    Otherwise (if they are the same or the other way around):\n        If a == b: draw.\n        Else: \n            If a='R' and b='P': then R loses to P -> Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n            If a='S' and b='R': then S loses to R -> Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n            If a='P' and b='S': then P loses to S -> Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n 2. We can create a mapping for each pair (a, b) to determine who wins and who loses.\n\n 3. We are to count for n rounds. Since the sequences are cyclic with period m and k, the entire pattern of pairs repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the state (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k). But note: the rounds are sequential, so the index for A is increasing by 1 each time, and for B by 1. The pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k). However, we don't necessarily need to use LCM directly because m,k <= 1000, but n can be up to 2e9.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n    We can precompute an array `cycle` of length L = m * k (but wait, LCM(m,k) might be less than m*k) but actually the state (i mod m, j mod k) for consecutive i will have a period of LCM(m,k). However, we can also note that the entire sequence of pairs for one full cycle (of the combined cycle) is of length LCM(m,k). But note: the indices for A and B are independent. Actually, the condition for the same state (i mod m, j mod k) is when i ≡ i' (mod m) and i ≡ i' (mod k). So the period is LCM(m,k).\n\n    However, we don't need to compute LCM explicitly. We can instead iterate over one full period (which is the least common multiple of m and k) but note: m and k are at most 1000, so the product is 1e6, and LCM can be as large as 1e6 (if m and k are coprime). Then n=2e9 would require 2e9 / LCM which could be 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000 cycles, and then we do 1e6 * 2000 = 2e9 operations which is too slow.\n\n    Alternatively, we can break the problem:\n\n    Let total_rounds = n.\n\n    We can consider the entire sequence of rounds from 0 to n-1. The outcome for round i depends on (A[i % m], B[i % k]).\n\n    We can precompute for one cycle of length L = LCM(m,k) the outcomes for all pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to L-1.\n\n    But wait: the state for round i is (i mod m, i mod k). However, the index i runs consecutively. The state (x, y) (where x = i mod m, y = i mod k) does not necessarily cover all pairs (x,y) in [0, m-1] x [0, k-1] in one cycle. Actually, the condition for the state (x,y) is that i must satisfy i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). This system has solutions if and only if x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k)). \n\n    Alternatively, we can think: We want to count for each round i (from 0 to n-1) the outcome.\n\n    We can use the following:\n\n    Let F(i) = outcome for round i.\n\n    We want to count:\n        total_nike_loss = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [Nikephoros loses in round i]\n        total_poly_loss = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [Polycarpus loses in round i]\n\n    Note: In each round, either one of them loses (if there's a win) or none (if draw). So the two counts are independent.\n\n    Another idea: Instead of iterating over n rounds, we can use the fact that the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let L = LCM(m, k). Then the pattern of outcomes for the first L rounds repeats.\n\n    Steps:\n        Step 1: Find L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)\n\n        Step 2: Precompute the outcomes for one period of L rounds.\n\n        Step 3: Count in one period:\n            Let per_nike = number of rounds in the period where Nikephoros loses.\n            Let per_poly = number of rounds in the period where Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Step 4: Then the total losses for Nikephoros = (n // L) * per_nike + losses in the remaining (n % L) rounds.\n\n        Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n    However, note: the state in round i is (i mod m, i mod k). But wait: in round i, the index for A is i % m, and for B is i % k. And the rounds are from i=0 to i=n-1.\n\n    But note: the condition for the state (x, y) is that i must be congruent to x modulo m and to y modulo k. However, the index i goes from 0 to n-1, and we can assign i to the state (i mod m, i mod k). But the state (x, y) does not necessarily occur for every (x,y) in the grid [0, m-1] x [0, k-1]. It occurs only for those (x,y) that are consistent with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (if they satisfy x ≡ y (mod g) for g = gcd(m,k)).\n\n    However, we don't need to worry about that. We can simply consider the entire set of rounds from i=0 to i=L-1 (which is one period) and then multiply by the number of full periods, and then handle the remainder.\n\n    But note: the round index i is the same for both. So the state for round i is (i % m, i % k). This state is unique for i in [0, L-1] because L is the LCM, so after L rounds the state repeats.\n\n    How many distinct states (x,y) are there? Exactly L states, and each state (x,y) in the set { (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to L-1 } is distinct.\n\n    However, note that the set of states (x,y) that appear is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k)), and there are exactly L distinct pairs.\n\n    Therefore, we can:\n\n        total_rounds = n\n        L = LCM(m, k)\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        Now, we need to compute:\n            base_nike = 0\n            base_poly = 0\n\n        For i in range(L):\n            a = A[i % m]   # since i < L, and m divides L, then i % m is just i mod m, but we can use i % m for any i, but here i from 0 to L-1.\n            b = B[i % k]   # similarly, k divides L? Actually, L is LCM(m,k) so yes, because L is divisible by both m and k.\n\n            Then, determine the outcome of (a, b):\n\n            Define a dictionary or function for outcome:\n\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                Then Nikephoros wins -> no loss for Nikephoros, but Polycarpus loses.\n                So: base_poly += 1\n            elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                Then Nikephoros loses -> base_nike += 1\n            else:  # draw, or same\n                nothing\n\n        Then:\n            total_nike = full_cycles * base_nike + (additional losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n            total_poly = full_cycles * base_poly + (additional losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Polycarpus)\n\n        But wait: in the above, we have defined the outcome for the entire period of L rounds. However, we must consider the remainder rounds: from 0 to remainder-1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            additional_nike = 0\n            additional_poly = 0\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a = A[i % m]\n                b = B[i % k]\n                # same outcome check as above\n                if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    additional_poly += 1\n                elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    additional_nike += 1\n\n            total_nike = full_cycles * base_nike + additional_nike\n            total_poly = full_cycles * base_poly + additional_poly\n\n    However, note: the period L is the LCM(m,k) and the remainder is taken modulo L, so the remainder part is the first 'remainder' rounds (from round 0 to remainder-1). But note: the period is defined by the rounds 0 to L-1, and the next round (L) is the same as round 0.\n\n    But wait: our state for round i is (i % m, i % k). And we are using i from 0 to L-1. The state for round L is (L % m, L % k) = (0,0) because L is divisible by both m and k.\n\n    This method is correct.\n\n    However, note: the LCM(m,k) might be very large (up to 1000*1000/1 = 1000000) which is acceptable for one period because 1000000 is 1e6, and then we do 1e6 * (number of full cycles) but wait: we are not iterating over the full cycles, we are just storing the counts for one period (base_nike, base_poly) and then for the remainder we iterate over at most L (which is 1e6) but n can be 2e9, so remainder is at most 1e6. So we do two loops: one for the period (1e6) and one for the remainder (<=1e6). Total operations about 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: what if m and k are not coprime? Then LCM(m,k) = (m*k)/gcd(m,k). The maximum value of m*k is 1e6, and gcd(m,k) is at least 1, so LCM can be as large as 1e6 (if m and k are coprime) or smaller.\n\n    However, note: the input constraints say m, k <= 1000, so the maximum LCM is 1000*1000 = 1e6 (if they are coprime). This is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: what if we have m=1000, k=1000? Then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, so the period is 1000, which is acceptable.\n\n    However, note: we are building a list for the entire period (L rounds). The memory usage is O(L) which is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n    But note: we are not storing the entire list of outcomes, only two variables (base_nike and base_poly) and then we iterate for the period to compute these two variables. Then we iterate for the remainder (which is at most L) to compute the additional losses.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        import math\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A_str)\n        k = len(B_str)\n\n        # Compute LCM of m and k\n        g = math.gcd(m, k)\n        L = (m * k) // g\n\n        # Precompute the base counts for one period (L rounds)\n        base_nike = 0\n        base_poly = 0\n\n        # We'll consider each round i from 0 to L-1\n        # But note: we can use i from 0 to L-1, and the state is (i % m, i % k)\n        for i in range(L):\n            a = A_str[i % m]\n            b = B_str[i % k]\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                base_poly += 1\n            elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                base_nike += 1\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        # Now, for the remainder rounds (from 0 to remainder-1)\n        add_nike = 0\n        add_poly = 0\n        for i in range(remainder):\n            a = A_str[i % m]\n            b = B_str[i % k]\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                add_poly += 1\n            elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                add_nike += 1\n\n        total_nike = full_cycles * base_nike + add_nike\n        total_poly = full_cycles * base_poly + add_poly\n\n        print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n    However, note: the example input.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Expected Output: 3 2\n\n        Let's break down the example:\n\n        n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4 -> LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        We would compute the base counts for 12 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the example has only 7 rounds. We can try with the example by hand.\n\n        Alternatively, note: the example provided in the note:\n\n        Round 0: R vs R -> draw.\n        Round 1: P vs S -> Polycarpus loses (so base_poly gets 1 for round1) and base_nike gets 0 for round1? Actually, in round1: \n            (P, S) is one of the winning conditions for Nikephoros? \n            Conditions for Nikephoros win: (R,S), (S,P), (P,R). Here (P,S) is not in that list. But wait, the condition for Nikephoros win is when he wins. (P vs S): P loses to S? Actually, no: according to the rules:\n\n            Rock beats Scissors -> R beats S.\n            Scissors beats Paper -> S beats P.\n            Paper beats Rock -> P beats R.\n\n            So for (P, S): \n                P vs S: since S beats P? Actually, the rule says: the winner is determined by: \n                - Rock beats Scissors\n                - Scissors beats Paper\n                - Paper beats Rock.\n\n            So if Nikephoros shows Paper and Polycarpus shows Scissors, then Scissors (from Polycarpus) beats Paper (from Nikephoros). Therefore, Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n            But wait, the example says: \"P - S. Nikephoros loses.\" -> so indeed, in the example, the condition for a loss for Nikephoros is when (a, b) is one of [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]?\n\n            Let me check:\n\n            Condition for Nikephoros win: \n                (a,b) = (R,S) -> R beats S -> win\n                (a,b) = (S,P) -> S beats P -> win\n                (a,b) = (P,R) -> P beats R -> win\n\n            Condition for Polycarpus win (and hence Nikephoros loses):\n                (a,b) = (S,R) -> S loses to R -> Polycarpus wins\n                (a,b) = (P,S) -> P loses to S -> Polycarpus wins\n                (a,b) = (R,P) -> R loses to P -> Polycarpus wins\n\n            So our conditions are correctly defined.\n\n        Now, let's map the example:\n\n        Round0: (R,R) -> draw -> no one loses.\n        Round1: (P,S) -> Polycarpus wins, so base_poly += 1 (for the period) and base_nike doesn't get a loss from this condition? Actually, base_nike is incremented for the condition [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]. Here (P,S) is in that list -> so base_nike += 1.\n\n        Wait, no: in the code, we have:\n\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                base_poly += 1\n            elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                base_nike += 1\n\n        So for (P,S): it matches the second condition -> base_nike += 1.\n\n        But in the example, the outcome was that Nikephoros loses (so we should count a loss for Nikephoros). However, the example says: \"Nikephoros loses\" meaning that Polycarpus gets a red spot? Actually, no: the problem says the loser gets the red spot.\n\n        Clarification from the problem: \n            \"In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot.\"\n\n        So when Nikephoros loses, then Polycarpus gets a red spot. And when Polycarpus loses, then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        Therefore, we are counting:\n\n            base_nike: counts the rounds where Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus wins) -> then Polycarpus gets a red spot in that round? Actually, no: in the example, the variable base_nike is the count for Nikephoros's losses (so we are counting the red spots on Nikephoros from the period). Similarly, base_poly is the count for Polycarpus's losses (so red spots on Polycarpus from the period).\n\n        But wait, in the example round1: \n            (P, S): Polycarpus wins -> so Nikephoros loses -> so we count base_nike += 1 (which is the red spot on Nikephoros).\n\n        However, the example output is: \n            Nikephoros has 3 red spots, Polycarpus has 2.\n\n        So for round1: \n            base_nike += 1 (meaning one red spot for Nikephoros)\n\n        Then round2: (S, P) -> \n            (S, P): check: \n                Win conditions: (R,S), (S,P), (P,R) -> (S,P) is in the win conditions -> so base_poly += 1 (meaning Polycarpus gets a red spot? No: wait, base_poly is for when Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses). \n\n        Actually, let me reexamine the code:\n\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                base_poly += 1   # because in these cases, Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n\n            elif (a, b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                base_nike += 1   # because in these cases, Nikephoros loses -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        So in round2: (S, P) -> (S,P) is in the first condition -> base_poly += 1.\n\n        So base_poly counts the losses of Polycarpus (i.e., red spots on Polycarpus) and base_nike counts the losses of Nikephoros (i.e., red spots on Nikephoros).\n\n        Now, the example:\n\n        Round0: (R,R) -> draw -> no increment.\n        Round1: (P,S) -> second condition -> base_nike += 1 (so far: base_nike=1, base_poly=0)\n        Round2: (S,P) -> first condition -> base_poly += 1 (base_nike=1, base_poly=1)\n        Round3: (R,P) -> third condition for win: (P,R) is the win condition? Actually, (R,P) is not in the first condition. The first condition is (R,S), (S,P), (P,R). (R,P) is not there. Then check the second condition: [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] -> (R,P) is in the second condition -> base_nike += 1 (now base_nike=2, base_poly=1)\n        Round4: (P,R) -> first condition: (P,R) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> base_poly += 1 (base_nike=2, base_poly=2)\n        Round5: (S,S) -> draw -> no increment.\n        Round6: (R,P) -> same as round3: base_nike += 1 (base_nike=3, base_poly=2)\n\n        So in 7 rounds, we have base_nike=3, base_poly=2.\n\n        Then, if we consider the period of 12 rounds (which is the LCM(3,4)=12), then we have computed base_nike and base_poly for 12 rounds. But we only did 7 rounds, so the full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, and remainder = 7.\n\n        Then we add the remainder part (which is the first 7 rounds) and we get 3 and 2.\n\n        However, note: our loop for the period (from i=0 to 11) is for 12 rounds. But we are only doing 7 rounds for the remainder. So the code would work.\n\n        But wait: the example provided in the sample input is:\n\n            Input:\n                ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n            Output:\n                ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n        Second sample: \n            Input: \n                5\n                RRRRRRRR   (length 8)\n                R          (length 1)\n\n            Then m=8, k=1 -> LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n            base_nike and base_poly for 8 rounds:\n\n            For i in range(8):\n                a = A[i % 8] -> always 'R'\n                b = B[i % 1] -> always 'R'\n\n            Then each round: (R,R) -> draw.\n\n            So base_nike=0, base_poly=0 for the period.\n\n            Then full_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, remainder =5.\n\n            Then we check the first 5 rounds: all (R,R) -> draws.\n\n            So total_nike=0, total_poly=0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, note: the period calculation: we are using LCM(m,k) which is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both m and k. This ensures that the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n    But wait: what if the sequences are not aligned by the same starting point? Our state is defined by the round index i. The round index i is the same for both players.\n\n    Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the period might be very large (up to 1e6) and n up to 2e9, but we are only iterating over the period (1e6) and the remainder (at most 1e6) so maximum 2e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: is the period necessarily the LCM? Yes, because the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) because LCM(m,k) is divisible by both m and k, so:\n\n        i and j are congruent modulo m and k if and only if i ≡ j (mod LCM(m,k))\n\n    However, we must note: the state (x,y) = (i mod m, i mod k) is determined by i. And the next time we see the same state (x,y) is when i increases by LCM(m,k). \n\n    Therefore, the code below:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A = input().strip()\n        B = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A)\n        k = len(B)\n\n        # If both sequences are empty, then no rounds, but n>=1 so m,k>=1 per input.\n\n        # Compute LCM of m and k\n        g = math.gcd(m, k)\n        L = (m * k) // g\n\n        base_nike = 0\n        base_poly = 0\n\n        # We are going to iterate for i from 0 to L-1 (one period)\n        for i in range(L):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                base_poly += 1\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                base_nike += 1\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        rem = n % L\n\n        add_nike = 0\n        add_poly = 0\n        for i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                add_poly += 1\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                add_nike += 1\n\n        nike_red = full_cycles * base_nike + add_nike\n        poly_red = full_cycles * base_poly + add_poly\n\n        print(nike_red, poly_red)\n\n    Let me test with the example \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\": \n        base_nike = 3 (from the 7 rounds, but actually we are iterating 12 rounds for the period, so we must compute the entire period of 12 rounds and then take the first 7 for the remainder.\n\n        However, note: the example only has 7 rounds, so the period of 12 rounds is longer than 7. But the period is 12, and we are breaking n=7 into 0 full cycles and 7 remainder rounds.\n\n        We must compute the base_nike and base_poly for the entire period (12 rounds) and then the remainder is 7 rounds (from 0 to 6). But the example provided only 7 rounds, so the base_nike and base_poly for the period (12 rounds) are not the same as the 7 rounds.\n\n        How do we know that the period is 12? The state (i mod 3, i mod 4) repeats every 12 rounds. \n\n        But note: the example rounds are 0 to 6 (7 rounds). The period is 12, so the base_nike and base_poly for the period (12 rounds) are the counts for 12 rounds. Then we use the remainder (7) to add the first 7 rounds.\n\n        However, the example only has 7 rounds, so we don't need the full period. But the code uses the period to break the n rounds into full cycles and remainder. \n\n        The problem: the example input is 7 rounds, so we must consider the first 7 rounds. Our code does:\n\n            base_nike = 0\n            base_poly = 0\n            for i in range(12): ...   # This is the period\n\n            Then we do the remainder for 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the period is 12, so the first 12 rounds include the first 7 rounds. However, we are counting the entire period (12 rounds) for base_nike and base_poly, and then we are counting the remainder (first 7 rounds) again for the additional part. That would double count the first 7 rounds.\n\n        Correction: \n\n            The period is 12. The first 12 rounds are from i=0 to i=11.\n\n            Then n=7: \n                full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0\n                remainder = 7\n\n            Then we count the first 7 rounds (i=0 to i=6) for the remainder.\n\n            But the base_nike and base_poly were computed for the entire period (12 rounds). Then we are using the remainder (7 rounds) to add the first 7 rounds. \n\n            This is correct because the full_cycles is 0, so the base counts are not multiplied, and we are only adding the remainder.\n\n        However, note: the base_nike and base_poly are the counts for the entire period (12 rounds). Then when we break n=7, we are effectively counting the first 7 rounds twice: once in the base counts (which includes the first 7 rounds) and then again in the remainder (which includes the first 7 rounds). \n\n        But wait: no. The base_nike and base_poly are computed for the entire period (12 rounds). The period is the repeating unit. Then the full_cycles is 0, so we don't use the base counts. Then we use the remainder (7 rounds) to compute the additional counts. \n\n        However, the base_nike and base_poly were computed from the entire period (12 rounds) but we are not using the base counts for the full_cycles because full_cycles=0. Then we are only using the remainder (7 rounds) to compute the additional counts. \n\n        But note: the base_nike and base_poly are computed for the entire period (i from 0 to 11). Then the remainder part (i from 0 to 6) is a subset of the period. We are not supposed to use the base counts for the entire period and then subtract the last 5 rounds? \n\n        Actually, no: the base_nike and base_poly are for the entire period (12 rounds). Then if we have n=12, we would use full_cycles=1 and then remainder=0. Then the base_nike and base_poly are used for the full cycle. But for n=7, we don't use the base counts because full_cycles=0, and we only use the first 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait: the period is 12, so the first 7 rounds are part of the period. The base_nike and base_poly (computed for 12 rounds) are the counts for 12 rounds. Then the remainder part (7 rounds) is computed independently. \n\n        However, the remainder part is computed by iterating from i=0 to i=6. But the base_nike and base_poly were computed for i=0 to i=11. There is no conflict because the base_nike and base_poly are not used for the remainder calculation. \n\n        But note: the remainder part is computed from i=0 to i=6, and the base_nike and base_poly are computed from i=0 to i=11. \n\n        This is correct because the full_cycles part is for complete periods (each period is 12 rounds). The remainder is the first 7 rounds of the next (incomplete) period.\n\n        However, the state for round i is (i mod m, i mod k). The period is defined by the round index i. The base_nike and base_poly are for the entire period (i=0 to 11). Then for the remainder (n % L) we start at i=0 again.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait, what if n=13? Then full_cycles = 13//12 = 1, remainder=1. Then we would use base_nike and base_poly (counts for 12 rounds) and then the remainder part (i=0) to compute the additional counts. \n\n    The total_nike = 1 * base_nike + (additional from i=0)\n\n    But base_nike already includes the outcome for i=0 (because i=0 is in the period). So we are counting the round0 twice: once in the base_nike (from the period) and once in the remainder.\n\n    How to fix? \n\n        The period is 12 rounds (i=0 to i=11). The next period (round12) is the same as round0. But we break the n rounds into:\n\n            full_cycles = n // L   -> 13 // 12 = 1\n            remainder = n % L       -> 1\n\n        Then the rounds are:\n\n            rounds 0 to 11: base_nike and base_poly\n            rounds 12 to 12: which is equivalent to round0 (because 12 mod 3 = 0, 12 mod 4 =0) -> so the state (0,0) again.\n\n        But the base_nike and base_poly were computed for the period from round0 to round11. The round12 is the same as round0, so we should not use the base_nike and base_poly for the first 12 rounds and then again for round12.\n\n        The issue: the base_nike and base_poly are for the entire period (12 rounds). Then the full_cycles part is for the complete periods (each period is 12 rounds). The remainder is the first 'remainder' rounds of the next period.\n\n        This is the standard way to break down periodic sequences. But note: the period is defined such that the state at round i is the same as the state at round i + t*L for any integer t. Therefore, the base_nike and base_poly are the counts for one period (12 rounds). Then the full_cycles part is the count for the complete periods (each 12 rounds). The remainder is the incomplete period (first 'remainder' rounds).\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Why did we get the example right? Because in the example, n=7, so we didn't use the base_nike and base_poly (they were computed for 12 rounds) and we only used the first 7 rounds (which are part of the period). \n\n        But for n=12, we use the base_nike and base_poly (which are the counts for 12 rounds) and then no remainder.\n\n        For n=13, we use the base_nike and base_poly (for 12 rounds) and then the first round (round0) of the next period.\n\n        However, the state for round12 is the same as round0, so the outcome for round12 is the same as round0. But in the base_nike and base_poly we already counted round0. Now we are counting round12 (which is the same as round0) again.\n\n        This is incorrect.\n\n        Correction: The period is the entire sequence of states that repeats. The base_nike and base_poly are for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently handling large `n` (up to 2·10^9) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a cyclic sequence of moves (rock, paper, scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences are cyclic, so the pattern of outcomes repeats every `L` rounds, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one period and then scaling up the results for full periods, plus handling any remaining rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period length.\n   - **Period Analysis**: For each round in one period, determine the outcome (who loses) and count the losses for each player.\n   - **Scaling Up**: Multiply the counts from one period by the number of full periods in `n` rounds. Then, process the remaining rounds separately.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging periodicity. The LCM calculation and period analysis involve O(m*k) operations, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences (up to 1000 each, making the maximum operations around 1,000,000), which is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n    \n    base_nike = 0\n    base_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            base_poly += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S', 'R'), ('P', 'S'), ('R', 'P')]:\n            base_nike += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    add_nike = 0\n    add_poly = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            add_poly += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S', 'R'), ('P', 'S'), ('R', 'P')]:\n            add_nike += 1\n            \n    nike_red = full_cycles * base_nike + add_nike\n    poly_red = full_cycles * base_poly + add_poly\n    \n    print(nike_red, poly_red)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period length `L`.\n3. **Period Analysis**: For each round in one period (from 0 to `L-1`), the code checks the outcome based on the current moves of both players. It counts how many times each player loses within one period.\n4. **Scaling and Remainder Handling**: The total losses for each player are calculated by multiplying the period counts by the number of full periods (`n // L`) and adding the losses from the remaining rounds (`n % L`).\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, avoiding the need for a brute-force simulation of each round.",
