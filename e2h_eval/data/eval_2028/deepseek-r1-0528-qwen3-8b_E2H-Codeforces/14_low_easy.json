He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n The function to count trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the same m may not be achieved by consecutive n. In fact, Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. But note that sometimes Z(n) stays the same for consecutive numbers until a multiple of 5 is reached.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, we are looking for n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n such that the factorial ends with exactly m zeroes, and then to list those n in increasing order.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing and stepwise. That is, Z(n) remains constant for a while and then jumps.\n\n Example: \n   Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, ...\n\n Therefore, for a given m, we are looking for the set of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n How to find the range of n for which Z(n)=m?\n\n We can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1, then the numbers between these two might have Z(n)=m? Actually, no.\n\n Let me define:\n   Let L(m) be the smallest integer n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Then the condition for having exactly m zeros is that Z(n)=m.\n\n But note: if we let A = L(m) and B = L(m+1), then for all n from A to B-1, we have Z(n)=m? Not necessarily.\n\n Actually, consider: \n   We know that Z(n) is constant in intervals. Specifically, once we hit a multiple of 5, the zeros increase.\n\n However, we can use binary search to find:\n\n   low_bound = the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n   high_bound = the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1\n\n Then, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is the set of integers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n But wait, is that always true? Let's check with m=1:\n\n   Find smallest n with Z(n)>=1: n=5 -> Z(5)=1, so low_bound=5.\n   Find smallest n with Z(n)>=2: n=10 -> Z(10)=2, so high_bound=10.\n\n Then the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have Z(n)=1. This matches.\n\n However, what if m is 0?\n   But the input m starts from 1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n But note: the problem says m>=1.\n\n However, we must also consider that the trailing zeros function does not necessarily jump by one. It can jump by more than one at a time? Actually, no, because the next jump happens only at multiples of 5. But note: at 25, Z(25)=6, but Z(24)=4, and Z(25)=6. So the jump from 24 to 25 is 2.\n\n But our method still holds: \n   For m=5, we want the smallest n such that Z(n)>=5. \n        n=20: Z(20)=4 -> not enough.\n        n=21: Z(21)=4\n        n=22: Z(22)=4\n        n=23: Z(23)=4\n        n=24: Z(24)=4\n        n=25: Z(25)=6 -> so the smallest n for m=5 is 25? But wait, there's no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n So if we define:\n   Let L(m) = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n   Let L(m+1) = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1\n\n Then, the set {n: Z(n)=m} is non-empty only if there exists n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n But in the example above, there is no n with Z(n)=5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily governed by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (let's call this \\( L(m) \\)) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (let's call this \\( L(m+1) \\)). The numbers \\( n \\) from \\( L(m) \\) to \\( L(m+1) - 1 \\) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial. \n\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., when \\( L(m) \\) does not exist or \\( L(m) \\) is greater than \\( L(m+1) - 1 \\)), then the answer is an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        low, high = 0, 5 * (target + 1) + 1\n        ans = high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if trailing_zeroes(mid) >= target:\n                ans = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return ans\n    \n    lower_m = find_lower_bound(m)\n    lower_m1 = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    if trailing_zeroes(lower_m) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        start = lower_m\n        end = lower_m1\n        if start < end:\n            k = end - start\n            print(k)\n            numbers = [str(i) for i in range(start, end)]\n            print(\" \".join(numbers))\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeroes(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The binary search is performed between 0 and a sufficiently large upper bound (5*(target + 1) + 1) to ensure coverage.\n\n3. **main()**:\n   - **Input Handling**: Reads the integer \\( m \\) from standard input.\n   - **Finding Bounds**: Computes the lower bounds for \\( m \\) and \\( m+1 \\) using `find_lower_bound`.\n   - **Validation Check**: Checks if the lower bound for \\( m \\) indeed has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, it outputs 0.\n   - **Output Generation**: If valid, it calculates the range of \\( n \\) values (from `lower_m` to `lower_m1 - 1`) that have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The count of these values and the values themselves are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function \\( Z(n) \\). The solution handles edge cases where no such \\( n \\) exists and ensures optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000).",
