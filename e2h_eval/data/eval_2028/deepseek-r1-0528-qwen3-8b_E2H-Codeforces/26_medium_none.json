    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D].\n\n We need to count the number of triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   x+y > z.\n\n Since x, y, z are independent in their ranges, we can try to fix two variables and then compute the valid range for the third.\n\n However, note the ranges can be up to 500000, so we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can fix x and y, and then for fixed x and y, the condition becomes z < x+y. But note that z must be at least C and at most D.\n\n So for fixed x and y, the condition is: z must be in [max(C, ...), min(D, x+y-1)] and also note that z must be at least C and at most D.\n\n But note: the triangle condition is strict: x+y > z -> z < x+y.\n\n Therefore, for fixed x and y, the number of z is:\n   Let L = max(C, x+y)   -> wait, no: actually, z must be less than x+y and at least C and at most D.\n   So the lower bound for z is C, but we must have z < x+y. Therefore, if x+y <= C, then there's no z? Actually, no: because z must be at least C, but if x+y <= C then even the smallest z (which is C) is >= x+y, so no z satisfies z < x+y.\n\n Actually, the condition is: z must be in [C, D] and z < x+y.\n\n So the valid z for fixed (x,y) are the integers in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] provided that C <= x+y-1. Otherwise, no z.\n\n Then the total count would be the sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, x+y-1) >= C, then the number is (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1), else 0]\n\n But note: this direct double summation is too slow because B-A+1 and C-B+1 can be up to 500000, so the product is about 25e10 which is too many.\n\n We need to find a smarter way.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix x and then consider the range of y and the condition on z.\n\n Another idea: change the order of summation by fixing the side z (from C to D) and then counting the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]?\n\n But note: we have three constraints: x<=B, y<=C, and also note that x>=A, y>=B.\n\n Condition: x+y > z, and we know z is in [C, D]. Also note that x<=B, y<=C, so the maximum x+y is B+C. So if z >= B+C+1, then no pair (x,y) will satisfy. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. The total number of triangles is the same as the number of triples (x,y,z) with:\n      x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y > z.\n\n 2. We can fix z (from C to D). For each z, we want to count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n        x+y > z,   with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n\n    But note: also we have the condition that y>=B and x>=A, but our ranges are fixed.\n\n 3. How to count the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z?\n        x+y > z  <=> y > z - x.\n\n    For a fixed x (in [A, B]), y must be in [max(B, floor(z-x)+1), C] (because y must be integer and greater than z-x). Also, note that y must be at least B and at most C.\n\n    Then for each x, the number of y is: \n        low_y = max(B, floor(z-x)+1)\n        high_y = C\n        If low_y <= high_y, then the count for x is (high_y - low_y + 1), else 0.\n\n    Then the total for fixed z is the sum_{x=A}^{B} [count for x]\n\n 4. Then we do this for each z from C to D. But note: D-C+1 can be up to 500000, and for each z we iterate over x from A to B (which is up to 500000). Then the total operations would be 500000 * 500000 = 250e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need to optimize further.\n\n Instead, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y > z for all z? Or use a two-pointer or cumulative sums.\n\n Alternatively, let's consider the entire set of pairs (x,y) without the condition on z. We have x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. The total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). But we are only interested in pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z.\n\n Notice that the condition x+y > z is equivalent to x+y >= z+1.\n\n We can precompute an array F[z] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y >= z+1, for z from 0 to (at most) B+C (which is 10^6).\n\n Then our answer would be: sum_{z=C}^{D} F[z]   [but note: we only consider z from C to D, and for each z, the condition is x+y >= z+1]\n\n However, note that the condition is x+y > z, so x+y >= z+1.\n\n Now, how to compute F[z] for z from 0 to M (where M = B+C, say)?\n\n We can fix x and then for each x, the condition on y is: y >= max(B, z+1 - x). And y must be in [B, C].\n\n Then for a fixed x, the condition on y is: y >= max(B, z+1-x) and y <= C.\n\n Then the number of y for this x and z is: \n        If max(B, z+1-x) <= C, then (C - max(B, z+1-x) + 1) else 0.\n\n Then F[z] = sum_{x=A}^{B} [max(0, C - max(B, z+1-x) + 1) if max(B, z+1-x) <= C else 0]\n\n But then we have to do this for every z from 0 to M (which is about 10^6) and then for each x (about 500000) -> again 10^6 * 500000 = 500e9, which is too slow.\n\n We need to invert the problem.\n\n Let T = x+y. Then T ranges from (A+B) to (B+C). We can precompute the frequency of T (the sum of x and y) and then for each T, we know that the condition x+y > z is equivalent to T >= z+1.\n\n Then for each z, F[z] = number of pairs (x,y) such that T >= z+1.\n\n Then we can compute an array F[z] by:\n\n   Let G[t] = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = t, for t from A+B to B+C.\n\n Then F[z] = sum_{t = z+1}^{B+C} G[t].\n\n Then the answer = sum_{z=C}^{D} F[z]   [if z is beyond B+C, then F[z] = 0, so we can break early]\n\n But note: the condition is that z is in [C, D] and we require that the pair (x,y) has x+y > z. However, note that if z >= B+C+1, then there is no pair (x,y) because the maximum T is B+C. So we can set F[z] = 0 for z >= B+C+1.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Step 1: Precompute the frequency array G for t from low = A+B to high = B+C.\n\n          For x from A to B:\n            For y from B to C: \n                t = x+y, then G[t] += 1\n\n          But note: x from A to B, and y from B to C, so the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). This is O(n*m) which is about 25e10, too slow.\n\n We need to compute G without iterating over each x and each y.\n\n We can do:\n\n   For a fixed x, the values of t = x+y, with y from B to C, so t ranges from x+B to x+C.\n\n   Then for each x, we are adding 1 to all t in [x+B, x+C]. \n\n   Then we can use a difference array (or two pointers) to mark these intervals.\n\n   Specifically, we can do:\n\n        Let diff = array of zeros of length (high+2) where high = B+C.\n\n        For x from A to B:\n            L = x+B, R = x+C\n            diff[L] += 1\n            diff[R+1] -= 1\n\n        Then we can do a prefix sum on diff to get G[t] for each t.\n\n   Then the total memory is about 10^6 (since B+C <= 10^6) and the time is O(B) which is acceptable.\n\n  Step 2: Precompute an array F for z from 0 to M (M = B+C) such that:\n\n        F[z] = sum_{t=z+1}^{B+C} G[t]\n\n        Then we can do a suffix sum on G: \n\n            Let H[z] = sum_{t=z+1}^{B+C} G[t]   for z from 0 to B+C, and for z >= B+C+1, H[z]=0.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let S[t] = G[t] for t from A+B to B+C, and 0 elsewhere.\n\n            Then we want for each z, the sum of G[t] for t from z+1 to B+C.\n\n            We can precompute an array suffix_sum[i] = G[i] + G[i+1] + ... + G[B+C]\n\n            Then F[z] = suffix_sum[z+1] (if z+1 <= B+C, else 0).\n\n        But note: our G is defined for t from A+B to B+C, and for t not in that range, G[t]=0.\n\n  Step 3: Then the answer is:\n\n        ans = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            if z < B+C+1:\n                ans += suffix_sum[z+1]\n            else:\n                # for z >= B+C+1, no pairs, so we can break early if we are iterating from C to D and D might be large, but note D<=500000 and B+C<=10^6, so we don't break because D might be less than B+C+1? Actually, D can be up to 500000 and B+C up to 10^6, so we don't break.\n\n        However, note: we can also set:\n\n            Let M = B+C\n            For z from C to min(D, M): \n                ans += suffix_sum[z+1]   (because for z > M, suffix_sum[z+1] is 0)\n\n        But wait: our suffix_sum array is defined for indices from 0 to M (and beyond we consider 0). We can define suffix_sum[i] for i from 0 to M+1.\n\n  Step 4: But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y > z, and we have fixed the sides as x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. \n\n  However, we must also ensure that the triple (x,y,z) satisfies the ordering: x<=B<=y<=C<=z. Our ranges already enforce that.\n\n  Therefore, the plan is:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the frequency array G for t from A+B to B+C using a difference array.\n\n        Step 2: Build the array G_full for t from 0 to M (where M = B+C) by doing prefix sums on the difference array.\n\n        Step 3: Build an array for suffix sums: \n                  suffix_sum[t] = sum_{i=t}^{M} G_full[i]   (for t from 0 to M)\n                  Then for a given z, we want the sum from t=z+1 to M, which is suffix_sum[z+1] (if z+1 <= M, else 0).\n\n        Step 4: Sum for z from C to D: \n                  ans = 0\n                  for z in range(C, D+1):\n                      if z+1 <= M:\n                          ans += suffix_sum[z+1]\n                      else:\n                          break   # because for all larger z, the condition fails.\n\n        But note: we don't break because z goes from C to D, and D might be less than M? Actually, we don't break because we are iterating from C to D. We can just use:\n\n                  ans = 0\n                  for z in range(C, D+1):\n                      if z+1 <= M:\n                          ans += suffix_sum[z+1]\n                      # else: 0, so nothing to add.\n\n        However, we can precompute an array H[z] = suffix_sum[z+1] for z from 0 to D (if D is large, but D is 500000, so we can do a loop from C to D).\n\n        But note: the range of z is [C, D] and C and D can be up to 500000, so the loop runs at most 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, note: the problem says A, B, C, D are integers from 1 to 500000, so the maximum M is 10^6, and we are building arrays of size 10^6, which is acceptable in Python if done carefully.\n\n  But wait: what if we do:\n\n        Let M = B+C   (max value of x+y)\n\n        Steps:\n\n          low_bound = A+B\n          high_bound = B+C\n\n          diff = [0]*(M+2)   # we'll index from 0 to M+1\n\n          for x in range(A, B+1):\n              L = x+B\n              R = x+C\n              # We are marking the interval [L, R] (inclusive) as having +1 for each x.\n              if L <= M:\n                  diff[L] += 1\n                  if R+1 <= M:\n                      diff[R+1] -= 1\n\n          Then build G_full[0..M] (we only care from 0 to M) by:\n              G_full[0] = 0   # we don't use index 0 for our t, but we can start from 0.\n              Actually, we can do:\n\n              G_full[i] = diff[i]   # but then we do prefix sums.\n\n          Actually, the difference array method:\n\n              Let arr = [0]*(M+2)\n              for x in range(A, B+1):\n                  L = x+B\n                  R = x+C\n                  arr[L] += 1\n                  if R+1 <= M:\n                      arr[R+1] -= 1\n\n              Then do:\n                  for i in range(1, M+1):\n                      arr[i] += arr[i-1]\n\n              Now arr[i] is the frequency for t=i.\n\n          Then build suffix_sum for i from M down to 0:\n\n              suffix_sum[i] = arr[i] + suffix_sum[i+1]   (if we go backwards, but we can do from M down to 0)\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n              suffix_sum = [0]*(M+2)   # index from 0 to M+1\n              # Start from the last index: M\n              # We want for a given t, the sum from t to M of arr[i] (which is the frequency for i).\n              # Then for a given z, we need the sum from t=z+1 to M: which is suffix_sum[z+1] (if z+1 <= M, else 0)\n\n              We can compute:\n\n                  suffix_sum[M] = arr[M]\n                  for i in range(M-1, -1, -1):\n                      suffix_sum[i] = arr[i] + suffix_sum[i+1]\n\n          Then the answer is:\n\n              ans = 0\n              for z in range(C, D+1):\n                  # We require t >= z+1, so if z+1 > M, then no pairs, else add suffix_sum[z+1].\n                  if z+1 <= M:\n                      ans += suffix_sum[z+1]\n                  # else: skip.\n\n  Example: \n      Input: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n      A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n      Then x in [1,2], y in [2,3] -> pairs: (1,2):3, (1,3):4, (2,2):4, (2,3):5.\n\n      So G_full[3]=1, G_full[4]=2, G_full[5]=1.\n\n      M = 2+3 = 5.\n\n      Then for z from 3 to 4:\n\n          z=3: condition t>=4 -> so we take t=4 and t=5 -> 2+1 = 3.\n          z=4: condition t>=5 -> only t=5 -> 1.\n\n          Total = 3+1 = 4.\n\n      Which matches the example.\n\n  But wait: the example lists the triangles: (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). \n\n      Why is (1,3,3) included? \n          Condition: x+y>z -> 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> true.\n      (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> true.\n      (2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3 -> true.\n      (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> true.\n\n      So indeed 4.\n\n  However, note that the example input \"1 2 2 5\" gives output 3.\n\n      Input: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n      Then x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (only y=2), z in [2,5].\n\n      Pairs: (1,2) -> t=3, (2,2) -> t=4.\n\n      Then for z from 2 to 5:\n\n          z=2: condition t>=3 -> pairs: t=3 and t=4 -> 2 triangles? \n          But wait, the triangles are: \n                (x,y,z) = (1,2,2): 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> yes.\n                (2,2,2): 2+2>2 -> yes.\n                (1,2,3): 1+2>3 -> 3>3 -> no.\n                (1,2,4): no, (1,2,5): no.\n                (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> yes.\n                (2,2,4): 2+2>4 -> no.\n                (2,2,5): no.\n\n          So the valid ones are: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3) -> 3.\n\n      According to our method:\n\n          G_full: \n            t=3: from (1,2) -> count=1\n            t=4: from (2,2) -> count=1\n\n          M = 4.\n\n          For z from 2 to 5:\n\n            z=2: t>=3 -> suffix_sum[3] = G_full[3]+G_full[4] = 1+1 = 2?

That counts two triangles for z=2: (1,2,2) and (2,2,2). Then for z=3: one triangle (2,2,3). \n\n      However, note: our counting for fixed z is independent.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use a mathematical and efficient method to compute the answer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) (where \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\)), the necessary and sufficient condition for non-degeneracy is \\(x + y > z\\). Given the ranges \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\), we need to count all triples \\((x, y, z)\\) satisfying \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of checking all possible triples, we can focus on the sum \\(t = x + y\\) and determine for each \\(z\\) how many pairs \\((x, y)\\) satisfy \\(t > z\\). This transforms the problem into counting pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\) where \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Array**: We first compute the frequency of each possible sum \\(t = x + y\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\). This is efficiently done using a difference array to mark intervals of sums.\n   - **Suffix Sum Array**: Using the frequency array, we build a suffix sum array to quickly compute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for any given \\(z\\) (i.e., the number of pairs where \\(x + y \\geq z + 1\\)).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) ranges to build the difference array (which is \\(O(B - A)\\)), then computing prefix and suffix sums (both \\(O(M)\\) where \\(M = B + C\\)). The final summation over \\(z\\) ranges is \\(O(D - C)\\). Overall, the complexity is linear with respect to the input sizes, making it efficient for large values up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    M = B + C\n    \n    if M < C:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    size = M + 2\n    diff = [0] * (size)\n    \n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        L = x + B\n        R = x + C\n        if L <= M:\n            diff[L] += 1\n        if R + 1 <= M:\n            diff[R + 1] -= 1\n            \n    arr = [0] * (M + 1)\n    if M >= 0:\n        arr[0] = diff[0]\n        for t in range(1, M + 1):\n            arr[t] = arr[t - 1] + diff[t]\n            \n    suffix_sum = [0] * (M + 2)\n    for t in range(M, -1, -1):\n        if t == M:\n            suffix_sum[t] = arr[t]\n        else:\n            suffix_sum[t] = arr[t] + suffix_sum[t + 1]\n            \n    ans = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        if z + 1 <= M:\n            ans += suffix_sum[z + 1]\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the maximum possible sum of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (i.e., \\(B + C\\)) is less than \\(C\\), no triangles can be formed, so the answer is 0.\n3. **Difference Array**: For each \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\), we calculate the range of sums \\(t = x + y\\) where \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\). Using a difference array, we efficiently mark these ranges.\n4. **Frequency Array**: By processing the difference array, we obtain the frequency of each possible sum \\(t\\).\n5. **Suffix Sum Array**: This array helps in quickly determining the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for any given \\(z\\) by summing frequencies from \\(z + 1\\) to \\(B + C\\).\n6. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), we use the suffix sum array to count the valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\), and sum these counts to get the final answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using mathematical insights and array techniques, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
