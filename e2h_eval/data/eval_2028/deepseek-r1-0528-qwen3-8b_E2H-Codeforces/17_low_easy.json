He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, and that they are prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n Approach:\n Since the problem says that there is at least one string consistent with the given set, we can try to assign each string as either 'P' or 'S'. However, note that:\n\n 1. The entire set of given strings has lengths from 1 to n-1, and for each length there are two strings: one prefix and one suffix (but we don't know which is which).\n\n 2. The string of length 1 might be both a prefix and a suffix? Actually, note: the problem says \"improper\" meaning from 1 to n-1, so both a prefix and a suffix of length 1 must be present.\n\n But note: the example input for n=2: \n     Input: \n        2\n        a\n        c\n\n     Output: \n        PS   (meaning the first string is S and the second is P) OR SP (first is P and second is S). \n\n However, the example output is 'PS'. But note: the problem says if there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n Observation:\n\n We cannot independently assign because the assignments must be consistent with the existence of a string s of length n.\n\n How to think?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let s[0..n-1] be the string we are trying to figure out.\n\n Then, the prefixes are: s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1]\n The suffixes are: s[1:n], s[2:n], ..., s[n-1:n] (if we consider 0-indexed and substring from i to j)\n\n Conditions:\n\n   For a string x of length k to be a prefix, we require that s[0:k] = x.\n   For a string y of length k to be a suffix, we require that s[n-k:n] = y.\n\n And note: the set of all given strings must include two strings of each length from 1 to n-1: one prefix and one suffix.\n\n However, there is an additional constraint: the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must agree on the overlapping part?\n\n Actually, for the entire string s to exist, consider:\n\n   Let the two strings of length 1 be a and b. Then the string s must start with a and end with b. But wait, what if the two strings of length 1 are the same? Then we have two possibilities: the same letter can be both the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1.\n\n However, note the example: \n     Input: \n        3\n        a\n        aa\n        aa\n        a\n\n     This is actually two strings of length 1: ['a','a'] and two strings of length 2: ['aa','aa']. \n\n     But wait, the problem says: \"exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\", so in this case for n=3, we have two strings of length 1 and two of length 2.\n\n     However, the example input is given as:\n         3\n         a\n         aa\n         aa\n         a\n\n     So we have two strings of length 1: two 'a's, and two strings of length 2: two 'aa's.\n\n     Then the string s must be of length 3. The prefix of length 1 is 'a', so s[0] = 'a'. The suffix of length 1 is 'a', so s[2] = 'a'. Then the prefix of length 2 is 'aa', so s[0:2] = 'aa' -> s[0]='a', s[1]='a'. Then the suffix of length 2 is 'aa', so s[1:3] = 'aa' -> s[1]='a', s[2]='a'. So the string is \"aaa\".\n\n     In this case, the assignment is fixed: both the length-1 strings are the prefix and suffix (so we can assign arbitrarily? Actually, no: one must be prefix and one must be suffix. But note: the problem doesn't say that the two strings of the same length are distinct. They could be the same.\n\n     Therefore, the two strings of a given length k might be identical. Then we have two possibilities: \n        Option 1: assign the first occurrence as prefix and the second as suffix? But wait, we are not told which is which.\n\n     However, note: the problem says \"Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes\" meaning that he gave you two sets: one set for prefixes and one set for suffixes, but the strings are mixed. And the set of prefixes and suffixes might contain duplicates?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to assign each string correctly as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem provides `2n-2` strings, consisting of two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. These strings must be split into prefixes and suffixes such that there exists at least one string `s` of length `n` consistent with these assignments.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`, the two strings provided must be the prefix and suffix of `s` of that length. The solution leverages the fact that the first character of the prefix of length `k` must match the last character of the suffix of length `k` when they overlap in the middle part of the string `s`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Group Strings by Length**: Separate the input strings into groups based on their lengths.\n   - **Determine Prefix-Suffix Pairs**: For each length `k`, compare the two strings to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix. The comparison is done by checking the overlapping parts between the prefix of length `k` and the suffix of length `k` in the hypothetical string `s`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once and performs comparisons based on their lengths, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    strings = data[1:1+2*n-2]\n    \n    d = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        k = len(s)\n        if k not in d:\n            d[k] = []\n        d[k].append(s)\n        \n    result = []\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        list_k = d[k]\n        a, b = list_k\n        \n        def check_overlap(prefix, suffix, n, k):\n            if k == 1:\n                return True\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, k-1):\n                    if prefix[i] != suffix[k-i-1]:\n                        return False\n                return True\n        \n        if check_overlap(a, b, n, k):\n            if check_overlap(b, a, n, k):\n                if a == b:\n                    result.append('P')\n                    result.append('S')\n                else:\n                    result.append('P')\n                    result.append('S')\n            else:\n                result.append('P')\n                result.append('S')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n            result.append('P')\n            \n    output = ''.join(result)\n    print(output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the length `n` of the string `s`, followed by `2n-2` strings representing potential prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: The strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary `d`, where each key is a length `k` and the value is a list of strings of that length.\n3. **Checking Overlaps**: For each length `k`, the two strings are checked to see if they can serve as the prefix and suffix of `s`. The function `check_overlap` verifies if the overlapping parts of the prefix and suffix (when considered in the context of the full string `s`) match.\n4. **Assigning Labels**: Based on the overlap check, each string is labeled as 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix). If both strings could potentially be either, the assignment defaults to 'P' followed by 'S'.\n5. **Output Result**: The labels for all strings are concatenated into a single string and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the constraints and properties of the problem, ensuring consistency with the existence of a valid string `s`.",
