A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime and the drink and salt are per toast (per friend) but multiple friends will share the same toast? \n\n However, note the problem: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n This means for t toasts per friend, the entire group (n friends) will require:\n   - Drink: n * t * nl milliliters\n   - Lime slices: n * t slices\n   - Salt: n * t * np grams\n\n But wait, the problem says they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n Alternatively, we can think in terms of the entire group:\n\n   Total drink available = k * l\n   Total lime slices available = c * d\n   Total salt available = p\n\n The entire group can have at most:\n   T_drink = floor( (k * l) / (n * nl) )   [since each toast for the whole group is n times the requirement?]\n\n But wait, the condition for one toast for one friend is given. Therefore, if we want t toasts per friend, then the entire group uses:\n   Drink: n * t * nl\n   Lime: n * t (each friend gets one slice per toast)\n   Salt: n * t * np\n\n So the maximum number of toasts per friend is limited by the minimum of:\n\n   T1 = (total drink) / (n * nl)   -> total drink divided by the drink needed for the entire group for one toast (which is n * nl)\n   T2 = (total lime) / n            -> because total lime slices is c*d, and for t toasts per friend we need n*t slices. But wait, actually for t toasts per friend, the entire group needs n*t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n? But wait, no: the entire group's requirement is n*t, so t <= (c*d) / n? Actually, we cannot exceed the total lime slices. However, note that the lime slices are used by the entire group: the entire group requires n*t slices. Therefore, the maximum t from limes is (c*d) // n? Actually, no: because the entire group needs n*t slices, so t <= (c*d) // n? \n\n But wait, let me reframe: \n\n   Let t be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   Then the total drink consumed is n * t * nl. This must be <= k * l.\n\n   Similarly, the total lime slices consumed is n * t. This must be <= c * d.\n\n   And the total salt consumed is n * t * np. This must be <= p.\n\n Therefore, the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n   t_max1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we use integer division?] but wait, we cannot use fractional toasts. We need to take the floor.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so the entire group for one toast (one toast per friend) needs n * nl. Therefore, the total number of \"group-toasts\" is (k*l) // (n*nl). But each group-toast corresponds to one toast per friend, so that gives the maximum t.\n\n   Similarly, from limes: the entire group for one toast (one toast per friend) requires n slices. So the total number of group-toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n   From salt: the entire group for one toast requires",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves determining the bottleneck resource that limits the number of toasts.\n2. **Intuition**: The maximum number of toasts is constrained by the most limiting resource. We calculate the possible toasts from each resource (drink, limes, salt) and then find the minimum among them. This minimum, divided by the number of friends, gives the number of toasts each can make.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves simple arithmetic operations:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p`.\n   - The maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - The maximum toasts from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - The maximum toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    max_toasts_by_limes = total_lime_slices // n\n    max_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    answer = min(max_toasts_by_drink, max_toasts_by_limes, max_toasts_by_salt)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n3. **Maximum Toasts Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Divide the total drink by the drink required per toast for all friends (`n * nl`).\n   - **Lime Limit**: Divide the total lime slices by the number of friends (`n`), as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Divide the total salt by the salt required per toast for all friends (`n * np`).\n4. **Result Determination**: The answer is the smallest value among the three calculated maximum toasts, ensuring no resource is exceeded. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of toasts by considering the most constrained resource, ensuring all friends can enjoy an equal number of toasts.",
