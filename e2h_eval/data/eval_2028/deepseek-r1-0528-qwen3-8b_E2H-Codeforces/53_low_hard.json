    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n However, note: we need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and these occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can consider all substrings and check for duplicates. But note: the problem asks for the longest one.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - We want the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check from the maximum possible length (which is n-1) down to 1 until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n How to check for a fixed length L?\n   - Extract all distinct substrings of length L (using a set or dictionary to track seen ones)\n   - If any substring appears more than once, then L is a candidate.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two occurrences (which may be overlapping).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"ababa\" -> Output: 3 (because \"aba\" appears twice: starting at index0 and index2, and also \"bab\" appears twice? Actually, let's check:\n        ababa: \n          length=5\n          Check for L=4: substrings: \"abra\", \"baba\" -> each appears once.\n          Check for L=3: \n            \"aba\" -> appears at index0 and index2 (so two times)\n            \"bab\" -> appears at index1 and index3? Actually, at index1 and then again at index3? Let's see: \n                indices: \n                  0: \"aba\"\n                  1: \"bab\"\n                  2: \"aba\"\n                  3: \"ba\" (if we take from index3, but wait: we are taking contiguous substring of length 3: \n                  So from index0: \"aba\", index1: \"bab\", index2: \"aba\", index3: \"ba\" (but wait, index3 would be from index3 to index5? Actually, we have to consider the substring from index3 of length3: \"aba\"? \n                  Actually, the string is \"ababa\": \n                    substring of length 3: \n                      [0:3] = \"aba\"\n                      [1:4] = \"bab\"\n                      [2:5] = \"aba\"\n                  So we have two \"aba\". Also, note that \"bab\" appears only once (from index1 to index3). \n\n          But wait, does \"aba\" appear twice? Yes, at indices0 and indices2.\n\n          Also, what about the example input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> outputs [0, 3, 2]\n\n          For \"abcd\": no duplicate substring -> output 0.\n          For \"ababa\": the answer is 3 (the substring \"aba\" is the longest with two occurrences).\n          For \"zzz\": the substring \"z\" appears three times, and the substring \"zz\" appears two times? \n            Actually, in \"zzz\":\n              Substrings of length 1: ['z','z','z'] -> so 'z' appears 3 times -> valid, but we are looking for the longest. \n              Then check length2: \n                 [0:2] = \"zz\", [1:3] = \"zz\" -> so \"zz\" appears twice. \n              Then check length3: \n                 [0:3] = \"zzz\", which appears only once.\n\n          Therefore, the longest substring that appears at least twice in \"zzz\" is \"zz\", so length 2.\n\n 2. Algorithm:\n    Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n\n    We can iterate over possible lengths from min(n-1, ...) down to 1 (but we want the maximum, so start from the maximum possible length and go down until we find one that has a duplicate).\n\n    However, note: the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is floor((n+1)/2) ??? Not exactly. Actually, the maximum length is limited by the condition that two occurrences must fit. The maximum length L must satisfy: n - L + 1 >= 2, so L <= n-1. But we know that if we take L = n-1, then there are two substrings? Actually, two consecutive substrings of length n-1? They are different because they share n-2 characters and differ in the last one. So we have to check all the way from L = n-1 down to 1.\n\n    But note: we don't need to check every L from n-1 down to 1 necessarily. We can break when we find the first L (starting from the top) that has a duplicate.\n\n    Steps:\n      For L in range(n-1,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which adds a layer of complexity to the problem. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that repeats at least once. The solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings with no repeating substrings (output 0) and strings where overlapping substrings are considered.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length found where a substring repeats is our answer since we are checking from the longest possible substring downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop approach:\n   - The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1.\n   - The inner loop generates all substrings of the current length and checks for duplicates using a set.\n4. **Optimization**: By starting from the longest possible substring and moving downwards, we ensure that the first duplicate found corresponds to the longest valid substring, allowing us to terminate early once found.\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (O(n)), we generate and check up to O(n^2) substrings. However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            print(L)\n            return\n            \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace. If the string length is 1 or less, the output is immediately 0 since no substring of length ≥1 can repeat.\n2. **Outer Loop**: This loop starts from the maximum possible substring length (n-1) and decrements down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length.\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each substring of the current length, it checks if the substring has been seen before in the current iteration. If a duplicate is found, it prints the current substring length and exits.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles strings with no repeating substrings by defaulting to 0 after checking all possible lengths. Overlapping substrings are considered naturally as the inner loop checks all possible starting positions for each length.\n5. **Efficiency**: The early termination upon finding the longest valid substring ensures optimal performance, especially for strings where the longest repeating substring is found early in the process.",
