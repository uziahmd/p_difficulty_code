He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. (But note: after appending c's, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' because A provided some 'a' and B appended some 'b'.)\n 2. The string is built in three steps:\n    Step 1: A has a string of some number of 'a's.\n    Step 2: B appends some number of 'b's (so now we have a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's).\n    Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's, and the number of 'c's is either equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string (which includes the original a's, b's and then the c's).\n\n However, note that the example \"bbacc\" is invalid because the order is not correct: \n   - The string must start with one or more 'a's (from A) and then only 'b's (from B) and then 'c's (from C). \n   - But in \"bbacc\", there are no 'a's at the beginning? Actually, wait: the example input says \"bbacc\" is NO.\n\n Let's break down the example \"bbacc\":\n   - The string has two 'b's, then an 'a', then two 'c's. This violates the condition that the initial part (from A) is only 'a's and then B appends only 'b's. So the condition on the order is that all 'a's must come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\n Therefore, we must check:\n   - The string must be non-decreasing in the sense: first all the 'a's (if any), then all the 'b's (if any), then all the 'c's (if any). And note: there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because A and B each put at least one).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: The string should be such that:\n      - All 'a's (if present) must be at the beginning.\n      - Then all 'b's (if present) must follow.\n      - Then all 'c's (if present) must follow.\n\n    However, note: what if there are no 'b's? Then the string would be just 'a's and 'c's? But the problem states that B appends some 'b's (so at least one 'b'). Similarly, the problem states that C appends some 'c's (so at least one 'c'? Actually, note: the condition for C is that he appends a number of 'c's equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. But note: it is possible that the string has no 'c'? Let's read again: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", so at least one? Actually, the problem says \"some number\" meaning at least one? Or could it be zero?\n\n    However, the condition also says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n    Note: the entire string includes the 'a's and 'b's and then the 'c's. So the total number of 'c' is set to be either the total count of 'a' or the total count of 'b'.\n\n    But note: the problem states that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends. So the final string will have:\n        count_a = (initial a's) \n        count_b = (initial b's) \n        count_c = either count_a or count_b\n\n    Also, the order must be: first all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n 2. Conditions to check:\n\n    Condition A: The string must be composed of three contiguous blocks: [a...], [b...], [c...] (each block can be empty? but note: the problem says that A provides at least one 'a', B appends at least one 'b', and C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says: \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\" (after B). Then C appends some 'c's (so at least one). Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", which typically means at least one. So the string",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific sequence of operations described. The operations involve appending 'b's and then 'c's to an initial string of 'a's, with certain constraints on the counts of these characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must consist of three contiguous blocks: one or more 'a's followed by one or more 'b's followed by one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: \n   - The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string.\n   - Additionally, the counts of 'a's and 'b's must be at least 1 each, as per the problem statement.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the string does not meet the basic order requirement or count constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string is composed of three contiguous blocks: a's, then b's, then c's.\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    # Skip all 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Now, skip all 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Now, skip all 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += �\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string adheres to the required order by scanning through the string sequentially for 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. If any character violates this order (e.g., a 'b' appears before an 'a'), the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After verifying the order, the code counts the occurrences of each character. It ensures there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Then, it checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical constraints of the problem, ensuring correctness for all possible valid and invalid inputs.",
