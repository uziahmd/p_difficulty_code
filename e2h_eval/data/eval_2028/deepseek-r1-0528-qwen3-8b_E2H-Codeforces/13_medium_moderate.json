For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes, but we don't know the order. We have to check if they form a major or minor triad.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (in semitones) relative to C (which is 0).\n    Notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    But wait: the problem says the notes are cyclic and after H comes C. Also, the example includes \"C# B F\" and orders it as \"B C# F\".\n\n    Let's assign numbers from 0 to 11 for the 12 notes.\n\n    According to the problem, the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    However, note that the example input \"A B H\" is given. In standard music, H is sometimes called B♭ (B flat) or in some systems Bb? \n    But the problem states: \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n    So let's map:\n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11   [But wait: the example says \"after H goes C\", so H is the 11th note (if we start at 0 for C).]\n\n    However, note the example: \n        Input: \"C# B F\" -> minor.\n\n    But in our mapping, let's convert the three notes to numbers:\n\n        C# -> 1\n        B -> 10\n        F -> 5\n\n    Then we need to consider all permutations of these three numbers (mod 12) to see if we can form an ordered sequence that matches either:\n        Major: [4, 3] (meaning the first two notes are 4 semitones apart and the next two are 3 semitones apart) OR\n        Minor: [3, 4] (first two 3 semitones, then 4)\n\n    But note: the chord is unordered. We can arrange the three notes in a circle. However, the problem says \"along the musical scale\", meaning we can wrap around?\n\n    However, the problem also says: the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (because from E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, F# to G is 3, G to G# is 4, G# to A is 5, A to A# is not present? Actually, we have up to H (which is 11). \n\n    But note: the example says the distance from E to C is 8. Since E is 4, then the next C is 12 (but we are modulo 12) so 12-4=8, but actually the circle is 12 tones. So the distance from E to C (if going upward) would be from 4 to 12 (which is 0) -> 12-4 = 8, but wait that is the upward distance? The problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", but then says the distance between E and C is 8. \n\n    However, in the definition of major/minor, we are ordering the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3 (for major). But note that the ordering must be consecutive in the circle? \n\n    Clarification: the chord is defined by three distinct notes, and we can rearrange them arbitrarily. The condition for major is that there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        (Y - X) mod 12 = 4\n        (Z - Y) mod 12 = 3\n\n    Similarly for minor: (Y-X)=3 and (Z-Y)=4.\n\n    But note: the entire set must be three distinct notes, so the total span from X to Z would be 7 semitones (for major) or 7 for minor too (because 3+4=7). However, because the circle is 12, we might have two ways to measure the distance (clockwise and counterclockwise). The problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, so we should take the smallest positive direction? But wait, the example \"E and C\": they say the distance is 8, which is the long way. However, when forming a triad, we are allowed to wrap around? \n\n    Let me re-read: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones\" — but if we have a chord with notes that are spread across the octave, we must consider the circle. However, the problem also says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are only considering the increasing direction until we hit the octave. But wait, in the example, the distance from E to C is 8, which is more than 6 (half an octave is 6 semitones). \n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that the distance is measured by going from E to F, F to F#, ... until C, which is 8 steps. But then, if we are to form a chord, we are allowed to consider the circle? \n\n    However, note that the chord is defined by three notes, and we can order them arbitrarily. But the ordering must be such that the entire chord fits in a span of 12 semitones? \n\n    Important: the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So we can consider the notes modulo 12.\n\n    How to compute the distance between two notes a and b?\n        We can do: (a - b) % 12, but then that gives the clockwise distance from b to a? Or from a to b?\n\n    Actually, we want the distance from note a to note b (going upwards, without wrapping, unless we consider the circle). But the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap? \n\n    Example: from C to E: \n        C (0) to E (4): 4 semitones.\n        From E (4) to C (0): if we go up from E to F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C — that's 8 semitones. But wait, the problem says the distance between E and C is 8, so they are considering the upward direction even if it crosses the octave.\n\n    However, in the definition of the triad, we are told to order the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3. This ordering must be in the circle, meaning we can have two possibilities for the same set: one that goes from X to Y to Z without wrapping, and another that wraps? \n\n    But note: the chord has three distinct notes. The total span of the three notes must be 7 semitones (for major/minor) because 4+3=7. However, 7 semitones is less than 12, so we don't need to worry about wrapping? \n\n    Actually, the circle is 12, so the three notes must lie within a span of 7 semitones (if we take the minimal span). But wait, what if the three notes are spread over two octaves? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" So we are working modulo 12.\n\n    Approach:\n\n    Step 1: Map each note to a number (0 to 11) as described.\n\n    Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three notes (each permutation is an ordering).\n\n    Step 3: For a given ordering (a, b, c), we require:\n        Condition for major: \n            (b - a) % 12 == 4   and   (c - b) % 12 == 3\n        Condition for minor:\n            (b - a) % 12 == 3   and   (c - b) % 12 == 4\n\n    However, note: the circle might allow negative differences. We can adjust by taking modulo arithmetic.\n\n    But wait: the distance from a to b should be the smallest nonnegative residue? Actually, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest. However, in the condition, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. But note: the condition requires that the first two are separated by 4 semitones and the next two by 3, so we are effectively building a sequence of three notes.\n\n    However, the problem does not specify that the three notes must be consecutive in the circle without wrapping. But note: the example \"C E G\": \n        C (0), E (4), G (7)\n        (4-0)%12 = 4, (7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n    Another example: \"C# B F\" (minor). The example orders it as \"B C# F\":\n        B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\n    Now, the distances in this ordering (without modulo? because 1 is less than 10) — but wait, we are on a circle. The problem says the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. How do we get that?\n        From B to C#: \n            B is 10, then the next note is C (11) and then C# (0)? Wait, no: we have to consider the circle.\n\n        Actually, the distance from B to C# going upward (without crossing the octave) would be (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 + 12 - 10) % 12 = 3. Alternatively, we can compute the distance from a to b as (b - a) % 12, but if negative, we add 12 and then take modulo 12.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the highest. In the example, B is lower than C#? \n        Actually, the circle: ... , 9(A), 10(B), 11(H), 0(C), 1(C#)... So B (10) is higher than H (11) no, wait: 11 is H and then 0 is C. But 10 is B and 11 is H, so B is 10 and H is 11, so B < H. Then C# is 1, which is higher than 0 (C) but lower than B? \n\n        However, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically and we consider the circle. But the ordering must be in the circle. The example says we order the notes as \"B C# F\". \n\n        What does that mean? It means we are arranging the three notes in a linear fashion, but the circle is broken at the point of the lowest note? \n\n        Actually, we can consider the three notes and find the root (the lowest note in the circle). Then we can arrange the entire chord in the circle starting from that root and then moving upward until we complete the octave.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the three notes and sort them in circular order.\n\n    There is a better way: since the chord is defined by three distinct notes, we can compute the intervals (differences) between the notes and then check if the set of intervals matches the pattern.\n\n    However, the problem says: we can order the notes arbitrarily. So we are allowed to pick any starting point and then go in increasing order (with wrap-around). \n\n    Let me think: the chord \"C E G\" is major. The intervals are 4 and 3. The entire chord spans 7 semitones. \n\n    The chord \"C# B F\": \n        We have notes: 1 (C#), 10 (B), 5 (F). \n\n        We can arrange the notes in increasing order (without wrap) as: 1, 5, 10. Then the differences: 5-1=4, 10-5=5. That doesn't match.\n\n        But wait, we are allowed to wrap? The example says the chord is minor when ordered as \"B C# F\". \n\n        How do we represent \"B C# F\" in numbers?\n            B (10), then C# (1) — but 1 is less than 10, so we break the circle at B (10) and then continue: from B (10) to C (11) to C# (0) to C (again?) — wait, actually we have to consider the circle.\n\n        The distance from B to C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 + 12 - 10) % 12 = 3, which is correct for the first interval (3 semitones). Then from C# (1) to F (5): (5-1) % 12 = 4, so that's 4 semitones. So the entire chord spans 7 semitones (3+4) but the notes are not contiguous in the usual linear arrangement.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider the circle. We can compute the differences modulo 12.\n\n    Revised plan:\n\n    For a given set of three distinct notes (each mapped to a number in 0..11):\n\n        We can generate the six permutations and for each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n                In Python, (b - a) % 12: if b < a, then (b - a) is negative, and then %12 will give a positive value.\n\n            However, the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. But if we are going from a to b and then to c, we must ensure that we are moving forward (increasing) in the circle. \n\n            But note: the example \"B C# F\": \n                a = 10 (B), b = 1 (C#), c = 5 (F)\n                d1 = (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 -> (-9 % 12) = 3 (since -9 + 12 = 3)\n                d2 = (5 - 1) % 12 = 4\n\n            This matches the minor condition (3,4). \n\n        However, we must also consider that the entire chord must be contained in the circle. But note that the condition for the chord to be a major/minor requires that the three notes form a contiguous segment of 7 semitones (so the total from a to c is (d1+d2) % 12, but actually we don't care about the total if we are using the modulus for each step). \n\n        But wait: the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals. The entire chord must be three consecutive notes in the sense of the triad intervals? \n\n        However, there's a catch: the chord may be represented in two different ways if we break the circle at a different point. But we are generating all permutations.\n\n    But note: the set of three notes is fixed. We are checking all orderings. \n\n    However, we must avoid considering orderings that are not the natural progression (i.e., the two intervals must be 4 and 3 for major, or 3 and 4 for minor). \n\n    But wait: what if the chord is given in a different inversion? For example, the major chord \"C E G\" can also be played as \"E G C\" or \"G C E\". \n\n    Let's try the inversion \"E G C\" for the major chord:\n\n        E (4), G (7), C (0)\n        d1 = (7-4) % 12 = 3\n        d2 = (0-7) % 12 = (0-7) % 12 = (-7 % 12) = 5\n\n        That doesn't look like 4 and 3.\n\n    But wait, the condition is: we must be able to order the notes so that the first two are 4 apart and the next two are 3 apart. \n\n    In the inversion, we are not necessarily having the root first. The root is C (0). The condition is independent of the root? \n\n    Actually, the definition does not fix the root. It says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n    So for the major chord \"C E G\", we can also order as \"E G C\" if we consider the entire circle? \n\n    But note: the example says the distance from E to G is 3, and from G to C is 5 (because from G (7) to C (0) is 5 semitones going upward: G->G#->A->A#->B->C, but wait, we don't have A#? Actually, the notes are only the 12 notes. So from G (7) to C (0) is 5 semitones (because 0 - 7 = -7, then add 12 -> 5). \n\n    But the condition requires 4 and then 3. We have 3 and 5. Not matching.\n\n    However, we can also consider the ordering \"G C E\":\n\n        G (7), C (0), E (4)\n        d1 = (0-7) %12 = 5\n        d2 = (4-0) %12 = 4\n\n        That gives 5 and 4. Not matching.\n\n    So how do we recognize the major chord in inversion? \n\n    Actually, the condition is defined for the entire set: the three notes must form a set of intervals that are 4 and 3 (in semitones) when arranged in ascending order (considering the circle). \n\n    But note: the problem does not specify the starting point. The chord is defined by the set, and we can choose any ordering. \n\n    Alternate approach: \n        Consider the three notes and compute the sorted list (in the circle) of the three notes. Then the intervals are the gaps between the three notes (including the gap that wraps around). Then we can check if the set of gaps (without the last gap that wraps) is {3,4} (for minor) or {4,3}? \n\n    Actually, the entire chord must span 7 semitones (because 3+4=7). And the three notes must be consecutive in the sense of the chord, but we can break the circle at the root. \n\n    However, the problem allows any ordering. So we can also consider the following:\n\n        We have three distinct notes. Let the three numbers be a, b, c (each in 0..11). We can arrange them in the circle. The three gaps (intervals) between consecutive notes (in the circle) must be the three numbers: d1, d2, d3 (with d1+d2+d3=12). \n\n        For a major chord, the three notes form a root, a major third (4 semitones) and a perfect fifth (7 semitones from the root). But wait, the intervals from the root are 4 and 7, so the gaps from the root to the next note is 4, then from there to the next is 3 (because 7-4=3). \n\n        However, the entire circle: the three gaps are 4, 3, and 5 (because 4+3=7, then the remaining to complete the octave is 12-7=5). \n\n        Similarly, for a minor chord: the root to the third is 3, then from the third to the fifth is 4 (because the fifth is 7 from the root, so 7-3=4). Then the gaps are 3,4,5.\n\n        Therefore, the chord is major if the gaps (when arranged in the circle) are [4,3,5] (in any order) and minor if the gaps are [3,4,5].\n\n        But wait, the set of gaps must be the same for both? No, for major the gaps are 4,3,5 and for minor the gaps are 3,4,5. Actually, the set is the same: {3,4,5}. \n\n        Then how to distinguish? \n\n        Actually, the condition in the problem is based on the ordering of the three notes. In the major chord, the root is the note from which we go up 4 semitones and then 3, and in minor we go up 3 and then 4.\n\n        But note: the entire chord is defined by the root. The root is the note from which the intervals are measured. \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the root. We are allowed to choose any ordering.\n\n        But the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as ...\" meaning that there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the condition holds.\n\n        So for the major chord, we can choose the root (X) and then the next note is 4 semitones above, and then the next is 3 semitones above the second. \n\n        The key is that the entire set of three notes must be contained in the 7 semitone span (from X to Z being 7 semitones). \n\n        However, the circle is 12, so we can have two possible ways to measure the distance (clockwise and counter-clockwise). The condition requires that the two consecutive intervals (from X to Y and Y to Z) are 4 and 3 (for major) and must be measured in the same direction (without wrapping the entire chord). \n\n        But wait, the example \"C E G\": \n            We can also measure the chord in the opposite direction: from C to G is 7, then from G to E? That doesn't make sense.\n\n        The condition is defined for a specific ordering. \n\n        Therefore, we must check all permutations and see if any permutation satisfies:\n\n            (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3   -> major\n\n            OR\n\n            (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4   -> minor\n\n        But note: the modulus operation might give the same result for two different orderings? \n\n        Example: the major chord \"C E G\": \n            Ordering (C, E, G): (4,3) -> major.\n\n        Now, what about the inversion (E, G, C)?\n            (G-E) % 12 = (7-4)%12 = 3, (C-G)%12 = (0-7)%12 = 5 -> not 3 and 4? \n\n        But wait, we are allowed to choose any ordering. The condition does not require that the entire chord is within one octave. \n\n        However, the condition is defined for three consecutive notes in the circle. The chord \"E G C\" is the same set, but the ordering is different. \n\n        The problem says: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n        In the ordering (E, G, C): \n            The distance from E to G is 3, and from G to C is 5. \n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. In the ordering (E, G, C): \n            The note E is 4, G is 7, and C is 0. \n            The lowest note in this set is C (0) and the highest is G (7). \n\n        However, we are ordering the notes as (E, G, C). This ordering is not by pitch. \n\n        The problem does not say we have to order by pitch. It just says \"order the notes\". \n\n        But the example input: \"C# B F\" is ordered as \"B C# F\", which is in increasing pitch? \n\n        Actually, the example input is given as \"C# B F\", but then they reorder it to \"B C# F\". \n\n        So the ordering is arbitrary? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"if we can order the notes\", meaning we can rearrange arbitrarily. \n\n        However, the condition is defined by the distances. The distances are computed in the circle. \n\n        But the example ordering for minor: \"B C# F\" is in increasing pitch? \n            B (10), then C# (1) — wait, 1 is greater than 10 in modulo 12? \n\n        Actually, we are using modulo arithmetic. The distance from B to C# is 3, and from C# to F is 4. \n\n        But wait, if we consider the entire circle, we can break the circle at B (10) and then the next note is C (11) then C# (0) then C (1) ... but wait, we are measuring the distance from B to C# as 3, which is the same as going from B to C# without wrapping (because 1 is 10+3). \n\n        So the condition is defined by the circle. \n\n        Therefore, the method is:\n\n        Step 1: Map the input notes to numbers (0-11).\n\n        Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        Step 3: For each permutation (a, b, c):\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            # But note: the entire chord must be considered in the circle. However, the condition does not require that the entire chord is within one octave? \n\n            However, the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. But we are using modulo, so we are getting the clockwise distance.\n\n            But the condition for the triad is that the two intervals (d1 and d2) are exactly 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n            However, there is a caveat: the chord must be three distinct notes. We assume distinct.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is given as three identical notes? The problem says triads (exactly three notes). And the input should be three distinct notes.\n\n        Step 4: If we find a permutation that satisfies (d1==4 and d2==3) then output \"major\".\n                 If we find a permutation that satisfies (d1==3 and d2==4) then output \"minor\".\n\n        Step 5: If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, output \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the example \"C E G\" works. \n\n        But what about the inversion of the major chord? \n            Example: \"E G C\" (which is the first inversion of C major). \n            We have: E(4), G(7), C(0)\n            d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3\n            d2 = (0-7)%12 = 5\n\n            This does not match.\n\n            Another inversion: \"G C E\"\n                G(7), C(0), E(4)\n                d1 = (0-7)%12 = 5\n                d2 = (4-0)%12 = 4\n\n            Not matching.\n\n        Why isn't the first inversion recognized? \n\n        The problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n        For the first inversion of C major (E, G, C), we cannot find an ordering that satisfies the condition? \n\n        But wait, the condition does not require the root to be first. It requires an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3. \n\n        Let me try to reorder the set {E, G, C}:\n\n            Possibilities:\n                (E, G, C): d1=3, d2=5 -> not.\n                (E, C, G): d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(7-0)%12=7 -> not.\n                (G, E, C): d1=(4-7)%12=-3%12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> not.\n                (G, C, E): d1=5, d2=4 -> not.\n                (C, E, G): d1=4, d2=3 -> yes, but wait, this is the root position.\n\n            So we are generating all permutations, and we did include (C, E, G) in the set of permutations. \n\n            But note: the input is given as three space-separated notes. The order in the input is not fixed. \n\n            However, we are generating all permutations, so we will consider (C, E, G) and (E, G, C) and so on.\n\n            But wait, in the example \"C E G\", we are given in the input as ['C','E','G'] and then we map to [0,4,7]. Then we generate all permutations, including [0,4,7] (which is C,E,G) and [4,7,0] (E,G,C) etc.\n\n            So the inversion is included.\n\n        But why didn't we find the inversion as satisfying the condition? Because the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals: 4 and then 3. The inversion does not satisfy that condition in any ordering? \n\n        However, we found that the ordering (C, E, G) does satisfy the condition. \n\n        Therefore, the code will output \"major\" for the set {C, E, G} because one of the permutations (the root position) satisfies the condition.\n\n        But what if we are given the set {E, G, C}? Then the code will still find the permutation (C, E, G) by rearranging the list? \n\n        Yes, because we are generating all permutations. \n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n            notes = input().split()\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            numbers = [mapping[note] for note in notes]\n\n            from itertools import permutations\n            perms = permutations(numbers)\n\n            found_major = False\n            found_minor = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                a, b, c = p\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12\n                # But note: the entire chord must be three distinct notes, so we don't worry about duplicates.\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    found_major = True\n                elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    found_minor = True\n\n            if found_major and not found_minor:\n                print(\"major\")\n            elif found_minor and not found_major:\n                print(\"minor\")\n            else:\n                print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait: what if a chord is both major and minor? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, let's test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7]\n            Permutation (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 -> major -> found_major=True.\n\n        Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] (since C#=1, B=10, F=5)\n            We need to check all 6 permutations.\n\n            One permutation: (10,1,5): \n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3\n                d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor -> found_minor=True.\n\n        Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11]\n            Check permutations:\n\n            Let's take (9,10,11): \n                d1 = (10-9)%12=1, d2= (11-10)%12=1 -> not.\n\n            (9,11,10): d1=(11-9)%12=2, d2=(10-11)%12=11 -> not.\n\n            (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)%12=11, d2=(11-9)%12=2 -> not.\n\n            (10,11,9): d1= (11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)%12 = (-2)%12=10 -> not.\n\n            (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)%12= (9-11) = -2 %12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> not.\n\n            (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)%12= (10-11)=-1 %12=11, d2=(9-10)%12= (9-10)=-1 %12=11 -> not.\n\n            So outputs \"strange\".\n\n        However, wait: the example input was \"A B H\", and the example output is \"strange\".\n\n        But wait, the example output in the problem is ['major', 'minor', 'strange'] for the inputs ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'].\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        However, what about the chord \"D F A\"? \n            D(2), F(5), A(9)\n            This is a major chord? \n            Root position: D, F, A: \n                D to F: 5-2=3 -> minor third, then F to A: 9-5=4 -> major third? \n            But wait, the condition for minor is (3,4). \n\n            Let's check:\n                Permutation (2,5,9): d1= (5-2)%12=3, d2=(9-5)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n            So \"D F A\" is minor.\n\n        Another example: \"D F# A\" -> major.\n            D(2), F#(6), A(9)\n            (2,6,9): d1=4, d2=3 -> major.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the chord is defined by three notes. The set {D, F, A} is a minor chord.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, there is an issue: the chord must be three distinct notes. The problem says so.\n\n        But note: the condition in the problem does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave? \n\n        What if the chord spans more than one octave? \n\n        Example: \"C E G'\" where G' is the next G (so 7+12=19). But wait, we are mapping to modulo 12. \n\n        However, the input only uses the 12 notes. So we don't have to worry about multiple octaves.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So if we have two Cs, they are the same. The input has three distinct notes.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, one more thing: the mapping for the note H. In the problem, H is the last note (11). But in standard music, sometimes H stands for B flat? \n\n        But the problem states: \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n        So we map H to 11.\n\n        But wait, in standard notation, B is the seventh note and C is the first. However, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. \n\n        This seems to be a custom set. \n\n        Let me compare with the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. \n\n        In standard music, the chord C# minor is: C# (root), E (major third) and G# (perfect fifth). But wait, the example chord is \"C# B F\", and they say it is minor. \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"the triplet 'C# B F' is minor, because if we order the notes as 'B C# F', than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.\"\n\n        So the chord is built from the root B? \n\n        In standard music, the chord B minor is: B",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer between 0 and 11 based on its position in the musical scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc., up to H=11).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Decision Making**: If any permutation meets the major chord criteria, the answer is \"major\". If any permutation meets the minor chord criteria, the answer is \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, the answer is \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    numbers = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary converts each note name to its corresponding semitone value (e.g., 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, etc.).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective semitone values.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each ordering, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Interval Validation**: The code checks if any permutation satisfies the interval conditions for a major chord (4 and 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 and 4 semitones). If found, the corresponding result is printed; otherwise, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutation generation and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
