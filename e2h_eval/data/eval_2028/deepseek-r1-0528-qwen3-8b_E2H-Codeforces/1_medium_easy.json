    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners that were double counted? Actually, the standard formula for the border of an n x m grid is 2*(n+m-2) for the inner part? Let me think differently.\n\n Alternatively, note that the ring is the set of cells that are at the border of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size n x m is:\n   If n==1 or m==1, then it's just n*m (but our rectangles are at least 3x3 initially, and decreasing by 4 each time, so for k rings, the rectangle for the i-th ring has dimensions (w0 = w - 4*(i-1)) and (h0 = h - 4*(i-1))). \n\n Actually, the border of a rectangle of size n x m (with n>=2, m>=2) is:\n   top and bottom: 2 * n, but wait: actually, the top row has m cells, the bottom row has m cells, and the sides (excluding the corners) have n-2 rows of 2 cells (left and right). So total is: 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n+m-2) + 2? No, wait:\n\n   Actually: \n     Top: m\n     Bottom: m\n     Left: n-2 (because the top and bottom rows already include the leftmost and rightmost of those two rows)\n     Right: n-2\n\n   So total = m + m + (n-2) + (n-2) = 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n - 2)\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate (which is w x h). So for the first ring (i=1):\n   n = w, m = h -> then the border is 2*(w + h - 2)\n\n However, let's check with the example: \n   Input: '3 3 1' -> Output: 8.\n\n   Using the formula: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) = 8 -> matches.\n\n   Now second example: '7 9 1'\n        Formula: 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28 -> matches.\n\n   Now third example: '7 9 2'\n        First ring: i=1 -> 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14 = 28.\n        Second ring: i=2 -> rectangle size: (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4 = 3, (9-4*(2-1)) = 9-4 = 5.\n        Then the border for the second ring: 2*(3+5-2) = 2*(6) = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n But wait, is that always the case? What if the rectangle for a ring becomes 1x something? The problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So the smallest dimension for the last ring is w - 4*(k-1) and similarly for h. Since k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), then the smallest dimension will be at least 1 (if min(w,h)=3, then k can be 1, then 3-0=3; if min(w,h)=4, then floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1, so k=1, then 4-0=4; if min(w,h)=5, then floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1, then k=1, 5-0=5; if min(w,h)=6, then floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1, then 6-0=6; if min(w,h)=7, then floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2, then for k=2: 7-4=3, which is still >=2, so the formula holds).\n\n However, note: the problem says the ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1))x(h - 4*(i-1)). The border of that rectangle is computed as above, provided that the rectangle has at least 2 in both dimensions? Actually, the formula 2*(n+m-2) works for n>=1, m>=1? Let's check:\n\n   If n=1, m=1: then 2*(1+1-2)=0, but actually a 1x1 has 1 cell. But note the problem condition: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the last ring is at least 1 (if min(w,h)=3, then k=1, so no problem). However, if the inner rectangle becomes 1x something, then we cannot use the same formula.\n\n But note the condition: k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). The smallest dimension for the i-th ring is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). The minimal value of these is at least 1. However, when the inner rectangle has one row (n=1) or one column (m=1), then the border is not defined by the same formula.\n\n Let me reexamine: \n   The problem says: the i-th ring is the set of bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   How many bordering cells?\n     If the inner rectangle is 1x1: then the entire cell is the border -> 1 cell.\n     If the inner rectangle is 1x2: then the entire two cells are the border? Actually, the border of a 1x2 rectangle would be the two cells (because the entire thing is the border). Similarly, 2x1: two cells.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the ring is the outer layer of the inner rectangle. The number of cells in the ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle, but without the corners being double counted? Actually, we can compute the ring as the entire inner rectangle minus the inner rectangle of the next ring (if any) but wait, the problem defines each ring independently.\n\n   Actually, the problem does not say that the rings are nested and the next ring is inside the previous one and we subtract, but they are independent. However, the description says the first ring is the edge, the second is 2 cells away, meaning the second ring is drawn inside the first, so the rings are nested.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\". This means that the i-th ring is the set of cells that lie on the border of the rectangle that is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and this set is independent of the previous rings? Actually, no, because the next ring is drawn inside, so the cells of the previous rings are not reused. But the problem does not require to avoid overlapping? Actually, the problem says \"there should be k gilded rings\", and the rings are drawn from the edge inward, so the rings are disjoint? \n\n   Let me clarify with the example: \n      Example: 7x9, k=2.\n\n      First ring: outer border of 7x9 -> 28 cells.\n      Second ring: the next inner rectangle is 3x5. The border of 3x5 is 2*(3+5-2)=12, and these 12 cells are distinct from the first ring? Actually, the second ring is drawn 2 cells away from the edge, so the second ring does not include the first ring's cells.\n\n   Therefore, the rings are disjoint.\n\n   Now, how to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n\n   Consider the rectangle of size n_i x m_i, where:\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the number of cells in the i-th ring is the number of cells in the border of this rectangle.\n\n   We can compute the border as:\n        If n_i == 1 or m_i == 1, then the border is the entire rectangle (since there's only one row/column, so every cell is on the border). But note: the problem states that the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. For a 1x1: 1 cell. For 1x2: 2 cells. For 1x3: 3 cells.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a general formula for the border of a rectangle of size n x m (with n>=1, m>=1):\n\n        If n == 1 and m == 1: 1\n        If n == 1 and m > 1: m\n        If n > 1 and m == 1: n\n        If n >=2 and m>=2: 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n+m-2) + 2? Wait, let's break down:\n\n        Actually, the standard way: \n            Top row: m\n            Bottom row: m\n            Middle rows (if any): two columns (left and right) each of length (n-2) for the non-corner parts, but wait, if we have more than one row, then the sides are n-2 long (because the top and bottom rows are already taken). \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the total cells in the rectangle and subtract the inner rectangle (if any) but that might complicate.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the ring is the border. And the border is defined as the outermost cells. \n\n   We can also think: \n        The entire rectangle has n_i * m_i cells.\n        The inner rectangle (if we remove one cell from each side) has (n_i - 2) * (m_i - 2) cells, but wait, we are removing two layers? Actually, the border is the set of cells that are either in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n        The formula for the border is: \n            total_border = n_i * m_i - (max(0, n_i-2)) * (max(0, m_i-2))\n\n        But wait, that's the entire rectangle minus the inner part (if the inner part exists). \n\n        Example: 3x3: \n            total = 9, inner part (if we remove one layer from each side) is 1x1, so 9-1=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example: 3x5: \n            total = 15, inner part is (3-2)*(5-2)=1*3=3, so 15-3=12 -> correct.\n\n        Example: 1x1: \n            total=1, inner part = (1-2)*(1-2) = (-1)*(-1)=1, then 1-1=0 -> incorrect.\n\n        So we must adjust: we only subtract the inner part if the inner part exists (i.e., if n_i>=2 and m_i>=2). \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the inner part for the rectangle of size n_i x m_i as (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) but only if n_i>=2 and m_i>=2. Otherwise, the entire rectangle is the border.\n\n        Therefore, the number of border cells is:\n            If n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                then the entire rectangle is the border: n_i * m_i\n            Else:\n                the border is n_i * m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n\n        Let me verify with 3x3: 3*3 - 1*1 = 9-1=8 -> correct.\n        With 3x5: 3*5 - (3-2)*(5-2)=15-1*3=12 -> correct.\n\n        But also check 1x1: 1*1 - (if we try to subtract (1-2)*(1-2)=1, then 1-1=0 -> wrong). So we must condition:\n\n            if n_i >=2 and m_i>=2:\n                border = n_i * m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n            else:\n                border = n_i * m_i\n\n        Now, what about 2x2?\n            Entire rectangle: 4 cells, inner part (if we subtract two from each) is 0x0? Actually, the inner part is (2-2)*(2-2)=0, so 4-0=4. But the border of 2x2 is 4 cells (all are borders) -> correct.\n\n        However, note the definition: the border of a 2x2 is the entire thing. The formula for the border using the alternative method (without condition) is the same: \n            Condition: 2>=2 and 2>=2 -> use 2*2 - 0*0 = 4.\n\n        Now, 1x2: \n            Condition: n_i=1<2 -> so we use 1*2=2 -> correct.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                ring_cells = n_i * m_i\n            else:\n                ring_cells = n_i * m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n\n        But wait, is that the same as the earlier formula for n_i>=2 and m_i>=2?\n\n            n_i * m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n            = n_i*m_i - [n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4]\n            = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n        So yes, the two formulas are equivalent.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the i-th ring as:\n\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                ring_cells = n_i * m_i\n            else:\n                ring_cells = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n        Then the total gilded cells is the sum for i from 1 to k of ring_cells.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't go below 1 in either dimension. But we must check that we don't get negative dimensions? The input constraints say w,h>=3, and k is bounded so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 1 in both dimensions.\n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            i=1: n1=3, m1=3 -> use 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2:\n            i=1: n1=7, m1=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28\n            i=2: n2=3, m2=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12\n            total=40 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we have a ring that results in n_i=1 and m_i=5? Then we use 1*5=5. Is that correct?\n            Example: w=5, h=5, k=2: \n                First ring: i=1 -> n1=5, m1=5 -> 2*5+2*5-4=20-4=16.\n                Second ring: i=2 -> n2=5-4=1, m2=5-4=1 -> then we use 1*1=1. \n                But wait, the condition for the second ring: the inner rectangle is 1x1, so the border is the entire 1x1 -> 1 cell.\n\n            However, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In a 5x5 plate, the second ring is drawn starting from the edge and going inward 2 cells. But wait, the plate is 5x5, so the first ring is the outer border (width 1). Then the next ring is 2 cells away, so we are removing two layers? Actually, the problem says: the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n            For i=2: (5-4*(2-1)) = 5-4=1. So the inner rectangle is 1x1, and the border of a 1x1 is 1.\n\n            But how many cells are in the second ring? It should be the cells that are two cells away from the edge. In a 5x5 grid, the second ring would be the 3rd row and 3rd column? Actually, let me visualize:\n\n            Plate: 5x5, first ring: all border cells (the outer 1). Then the second ring: the next border, which is the inner 1x1? Actually, the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size 1x1, which is the center cell.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\". In the 5x5, the center cell is exactly 2 cells away from the edge (because from the top: 2 cells down, from the left: 2 cells right). So that matches.\n\n            Now, what is the total? 16 (first ring) + 1 (second ring) = 17.\n\n            But wait, the example input was bounded by k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=5, h=5: min(w,h)=5, floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. So k can only be 1. Therefore, we are safe because the input k is at most 1.\n\n            Another example: w=6, h=6, then floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1, so k=1.\n\n            Example: w=8, h=8, then floor((8+1)/4)=floor(9/4)=2. Then k can be 2.\n\n            For k=2: \n                i=1: 8x8 -> 2*(8+8-2)=2*14=28? Or by our formula: 8*8 - (8-2)*(8-2)=64-36=28.\n                i=2: 8-4=4, so 4x4 -> 4*4 - (4-2)*(4-2)=16-4=12.\n\n            Total: 28+12=40.\n\n            Now, if we use the condition: \n                i=1: n_i=8>=2, m_i=8>=2 -> 2*8+2*8-4=16+16-4=28.\n                i=2: n_i=4>=2, m_i=4>=2 -> 2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n            Also correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can write the solution as:\n\n            Read w, h, k\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, k+1):\n                n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n                m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n                if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                    # Then the entire current rectangle is the border\n                    total += n_i * m_i\n                else:\n                    total += 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n            Print(total)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the rings are drawn from the edge inward, and the k-th ring must satisfy that the inner rectangle is at least 1x1 (as per the constraint). Our loop goes from i=1 to k, and the constraint on k ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 1 in both dimensions (so we don't get negative dimensions). \n\n        But what if during the process, one dimension becomes less than 2 and the other remains >=2? For example, w=5, h=10, k=2:\n            i=1: n1=5, m1=10 -> 2*5+2*10-4 = 10+20-4=26\n            i=2: n2=5-4=1, m2=10-4=6 -> use 1*6=6 -> total=32.\n\n        Is that correct? \n            The first ring: the outer border of 5x10: \n                Using the formula: 2*(5+10-2)=2*13=26 -> correct.\n            The second ring: the inner rectangle is 1x6. The border is the entire 1x6, so 6 cells. \n            But wait, in a 5x10 plate, the second ring (being 2 cells away from the edge) would normally leave a gap. However, the problem says the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (5-4)=1 and (10-4)=6. \n\n            How is that visualized? \n                The plate is 5x10. The first ring takes the outer 1 cell. Then the second ring is drawn 2 cells away from the edge. But note: the plate has 5 rows. After removing 2 cells from the top and bottom (each removal of 2 cells: one for the first ring and one for the second ring? Actually, the problem doesn't specify removal, it specifies the ring is drawn as the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n            The inner rectangle for the second ring is defined as having width (5-4*(2-1))=1 and height (10-4*(2-1))=6. So the second ring is the border of a 1x6 rectangle. In a 1x6, the entire rectangle is the border. \n\n            However, in the actual grid, the second ring would be the cells that are at the border of the inner rectangle. But the inner rectangle is 1 row and 6 columns. The border of that is the entire 1 row (because if you have only one row, then the top and bottom are the same, and the sides are the entire row). \n\n            But wait, the second ring is supposed to be 2 cells away from the edge. In a 5x10 grid, the second ring should be located at the 3rd row (if we count from the top: the first ring is row0 and row4 (if 0-indexed and 5 rows: indices 0 to 4), then the second ring would be the border of the inner rectangle that starts at row2? Actually, the inner rectangle for the second ring is defined by the original plate, but we don't remove the first ring's cells. \n\n            The problem does not say that the rings are drawn by removing the cells. Instead, it defines the i-th ring as the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)). \n\n            So the second ring is the border of the 1x6 inner rectangle. In the 5x10 grid, the inner rectangle of 1x6 is the middle row (row index 2) and columns from 1 to 6 (if we consider the plate as having columns 0 to 9). But wait, the inner rectangle is 1x6: that means we are taking 1 row and 6 consecutive columns? Actually, the inner rectangle is defined by shrinking the plate by 2 cells from each side (for the first ring) and then again by 2 cells for the second ring? \n\n            The problem says: the first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away. So the second ring is drawn 2 cells away from the edge, meaning that we have removed two layers from the plate? Actually, the inner rectangle for the second ring is defined as (w-4*(2-1)) = w-4, and (h-4*(2-1))=h-4. \n\n            This implies that we are considering a rectangle that is 4*(i-1) smaller in each dimension from the original. \n\n            Therefore, the second ring is the border of the rectangle that is 1 row and 6 columns. But in the original grid, that 1 row is the third row (if we remove two rows from the top and two from the bottom: 5-2*2=1, so the inner rectangle is the third row, and the columns: 10-2*2=6, so the third row from column 1 to column 6 (if we start counting from 0, then columns 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 columns). \n\n            Then the second ring is the entire third row from column 1 to 6 (6 cells). \n\n            However, the first ring was the outer border: \n                Rows: 0 and 4 (the first and last row) and the entire columns 0 and 9 (the first and last column) for the rows 0 to 4, but wait: actually the first ring includes the entire outer frame. \n\n            The first ring: \n                Top row: row0, columns0 to 9 -> 10 cells.\n                Bottom row: row4, columns0 to 9 -> 10 cells.\n                Left side: columns0, rows1 to 3 -> 3 cells.\n                Right side: columns9, rows1 to 3 -> 3 cells.\n                But wait, the corners are included in the top and bottom. So total = 10+10+3+3 = 26.\n\n            The second ring: \n                The inner rectangle is the row2 (index2) from column1 to column6 (inclusive) -> 6 cells.\n\n            Are these two sets disjoint? \n                First ring: rows0,4 and columns0,9, and the sides (rows1-3, columns0 and 9).\n                Second ring: row2, columns1-6.\n\n            The second ring does not overlap with the first ring because:\n                Row2 is not the top (row0) or bottom (row4) and column1-6 are not the first or last column (columns0 and 9) in the second ring's row? Actually, in row2, the first and last columns (column0 and column9) are not included in the second ring's inner rectangle (which is columns1 to6). \n\n            Therefore, the second ring is indeed disjoint.\n\n            So the calculation is correct.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n            Read the input: one line with three integers w, h, k.\n\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                # For the i-th ring (starting from 0, but we use i from 0 to k-1, then the reduction is 4*i)\n                n_i = w - 4*i\n                m_i = h - 4*i\n                if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                    total += n_i * m_i\n                else:\n                    total += 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait, in the problem statement, the i-th ring uses (w - 4*(i-1)). In our loop, if we let i go from 0 to k-1, then we are using 4*i. \n\n        Let me check: \n            For the first ring (i=0): \n                n_i = w - 0 = w, m_i = h - 0 = h -> correct.\n\n            For the second ring (i=1): \n                n_i = w - 4, m_i = h - 4 -> correct.\n\n        So the indexing is off by one in the problem statement? Actually, the problem says the i-th ring uses (w - 4*(i-1)), so for i=1: subtract 0, for i=2: subtract 4, for i=3: subtract 8, etc.\n\n        In our loop, we are using i from 0 to k-1, so the i-th iteration (0-indexed) corresponds to ring number i+1, and we subtract 4*i. \n\n        But the problem's i-th ring (i from 1 to k) subtracts 4*(i-1). \n\n        We can also change the loop variable to j from 1 to k, then:\n\n            for j in range(1, k+1):\n                n_i = w - 4*(j-1)\n                m_i = h - 4*(j-1)\n\n        But the above code uses j from 0 to k-1 (if we use range(k)) and subtracts 4*i, which is the same as 4*(j) for the (j+1)-th ring. \n\n        Actually, wait: \n            In the problem, the first ring (j=1) uses 4*(1-1)=0.\n            In our code, if we use i from 0 to k-1, then for the first ring we use i=0, subtract 4*0=0 -> same.\n\n            Second ring: j=2 in problem, uses 4*(2-1)=4; in our code, i=1, subtract 4*1=4 -> same.\n\n        Therefore, the two are equivalent.\n\n        However, note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Our loop runs for k iterations, and we subtract 4*i, so the last ring (i=k-1) subtracts 4*(k-1). \n\n        The condition for the last ring: \n            n_i = w - 4*(k-1) >= 1 (by the problem constraint) and similarly for h.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Let's test with the example: '3 3 1'\n\n            w=3, h=3, k=1\n            i=0: n_i=3, m_i=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4=12-4=8 -> output 8.\n\n        Example: '7 9 1'\n            i=0: 7,9 -> 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28.\n\n        Example: '7 9 2'\n            i=0: 7,9 -> 28\n            i=1: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total 40.\n\n        Example: w=5, h=5, k=1 (as above) -> 8*5? wait, no: \n            i=0: 5,5 -> 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n        But wait, the example above for w=5,h=5,k=2 was constrained to k=1. Now, if k=1, then output 16.\n\n        Another example: w=4, h=4, k=1 (but wait, the input constraint: w,h>=3, and k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=4, h=4: min(w,h)=4, floor((4+1)/4)=1, so k=1.\n\n            i=0: 4,4 -> 2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n        But let me count the border of a 4x4: \n            Total cells: 16.\n            Inner part: (4-2)x(4-2)=2x2=4.\n            Border: 16-4=12 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            w = int(data[0])\n            h = int(data[1])\n            k = int(data[2])\n\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                n_i = w - 4*i\n                m_i = h - 4*i\n                if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                    total += n_i * m_i\n                else:\n                    total += 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n            print(total)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, which is the outermost. Our formula for the first ring (i=0) is correct.\n\n        Let me test with a small k and w=3, h=3, k=1: 8 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if k=0? The problem states k>=1, so no need.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). We don't need to worry about k=0.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Input: '3 3 1' -> 8\n            Input: '7 9 1' -> 28\n            Input: '7 9 2' -> 40\n\n        All match.\n\n        One more: w=5, h=5, k=1 -> 16.\n\n        But wait, the example input was ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] and outputs ['8','28','40'].\n\n        We are good.\n\n        However, note: the example input format: the input is given as a list of strings in the example, but the problem reads from stdin. We are reading one line and splitting.\n\n        Code:\n\n            def main():\n                data = input().split()\n                w = int(data[0])\n                h = int(data[1])\n                k = int(data[2])\n                total = 0\n                for i in range(k):\n                    n_i = w - 4*i\n                    m_i = h - 4*i\n                    if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n                        total += n_i * m_i\n                    else:\n                        total += 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n                print(total)\n\n        Let me submit.\n\n        But wait, there's a possibility: what if the inner rectangle has one row and multiple columns? We handled that with the condition. Similarly for one column and multiple rows.\n\n        Example: w=3, h=10, k= floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> so k=1.\n            Then the first ring: 3x10 -> 2*3+2*10-4=6+20-4=22.\n\n        Example: w=10, h=3, k=1 -> same: 2*10+2*3-4=20+6-4=22.\n\n        Example: w=2, h=10 -> but wait, the input constraint says w,h>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        All set.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined as the border of an inner rectangle that shrinks by 4 cells in both dimensions from the previous one. The first ring is the outermost border of the entire plate, and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings. Each ring is the border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller than the previous one. The key observation is that each ring's border can be calculated independently based on its dimensions.\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are derived by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both the width and height of the original plate, where `i` is the ring number (starting from 1). The number of cells in the border of this rectangle depends on whether the rectangle has at least 2 rows and columns. If either dimension is less than 2, the entire rectangle is considered the border; otherwise, the border is calculated using the formula `2*length + 2*width - 4`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, and then determine the number of cells in its border. Summing these values gives the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where `k` is the number of rings. Since `k` is bounded by the floor of `(min(w, h) + 1)/4`, the solution efficiently handles the constraints without any performance issues.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    w = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2])\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        n_i = w - 4 * i\n        m_i = h - 4 * i\n        if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n            total += n_i * m_i\n        else:\n            total += 2 * n_i + 2 * m_i - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to `k-1`:\n   - **Calculate Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are computed by subtracting `4*i` from both `w` and `h`.\n   - **Border Calculation**: If either dimension is less than 2, the entire rectangle is the border, so we add the product of the dimensions to `total`. Otherwise, we use the formula `2*length + 2*width - 4` to compute the border cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
