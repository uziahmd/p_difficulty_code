Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street [0, l] must be covered.\n\n Observation:\n - The leftmost point is 0 and the rightmost point is l.\n - The lanterns must cover from 0 to l.\n\n Consider gaps:\n a) Between 0 and the first lantern.\n    The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position. So the required d for this gap is at least (first_lantern_position - 0) / 2.\n\n b) Between two consecutive lanterns (say at positions a[i] and a[i+1]).\n    The gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The light from the two adjacent lanterns must meet in the middle? Actually, the maximum gap that can be covered by two lanterns with radius d is when each lantern covers half of the gap? But note: we can have a larger d than necessary for one gap, but we are looking for the minimum d that covers all.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be lit. The idea is to cover the gaps between lanterns and the edges.\n\n We can think of the street being broken into segments:\n\n  Segment 1: from 0 to the first lantern (a0)\n  Segment 2: from the last lantern (a_{n-1}) to l\n  Segment 3: between consecutive lanterns\n\n For the edges:\n   - To cover from 0 to a0, we need a lantern at a0 to cover 0. Therefore, d must be at least (a0 - 0)/2.\n   - Similarly, to cover from a_{n-1} to l, we need d at least (l - a_{n-1])/2.\n\n For the gaps between two lanterns (a_i and a_{i+1]):\n   The entire segment [a_i, a_{i+1}] must be covered. The two lanterns can cover up to (a_{i+1] - a_i) / 2 on each side? Actually, the coverage from the left lantern extends to the right until a_i + d, and the coverage from the right lantern extends to the left until a_{i+1] - d. For there to be no gap in the middle, we require:\n        a_i + d >= a_{i+1] - d   =>   d >= (a_{i+1] - a_i) / 2\n\n But wait, actually we might not require the two lanterns to meet exactly in the middle. We just require that the entire interval [a_i, a_{i+1]] is covered. The left lantern will cover up to a_i + d, and the right lantern will cover down to a_{i+1] - d. So we require:\n        a_i + d >= a_{i+1] - d   -> This ensures that the two lights overlap or meet. However, note that if the gap is small, then even if the two lights do not meet, as long as the entire gap is covered by the union, it's okay. But actually, the condition is that the entire gap must be within the union. The left lantern covers [a_i - d, a_i + d] and the right lantern covers [a_{i+1] - d, a_{i+1] + d]. The critical part is the gap between a_i and a_{i+1].\n\n However, note that the lanterns are fixed and we are allowed to set the same d for all. The minimal d must be at least half the gap between two consecutive lanterns because if the gap is g, then to cover the entire gap, the two lanterns together must extend at least g/2 from the midpoint. Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   d_min_gap = (a_{i+1] - a_i) / 2\n\n But also, consider that the left edge of the gap (which is the right end of the previous lantern) must be covered by the next lantern? Actually, we don't have to worry about the entire street being covered by the union of the lanterns if we set d appropriately.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be covered. We can break the problem:\n\n   Let d_min = max(\n        (first_lantern - 0) / 2,\n        (l - last_lantern) / 2,\n        max_{for each consecutive pair i} ( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 )\n   )\n\n But wait, is that sufficient? Let's test with the example: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n   Here, n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\n   Edge 1: (2-0)/",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street to find the smallest `d` that ensures complete coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Edge Gaps**: The leftmost point `0` must be covered by the first lantern, so `d` must be at least `(first_lantern_position - 0) / 2`. Similarly, the rightmost point `l` must be covered by the last lantern, so `d` must be at least `(l - last_lantern_position) / 2`.\n   - **Consecutive Lanterns**: For any two consecutive lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the gap between them must be covered. The minimal `d` required here is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`, ensuring the lanterns' light ranges overlap sufficiently to cover the entire segment between them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the lantern positions to easily identify gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges.\n   - Compute the required `d` for each edge and consecutive pair, then take the maximum value among these as the minimal `d` needed for full coverage.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    d_candidate1 = positions[0] / 2.0\n    d_candidate2 = (l - positions[-1]) / 2.0\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n            \n    d_candidate3 = max_gap / 2.0 if n > 1 else 0.0\n    \n    d_required = max(d_candidate1, d_candidate2, d_candidate3)\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_required))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**:\n   - **Left Edge (`d_candidate1`)**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern divided by 2.\n   - **Right Edge (`d_candidate2`)**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street divided by 2.\n4. **Consecutive Lanterns Handling (`d_candidate3`)**: The largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns divided by 2. This ensures the light from adjacent lanterns covers the entire segment between them.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among the three computed candidates gives the minimal `d` required to illuminate the entire street. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all critical segments of the street (edges and gaps between lanterns) to determine the smallest uniform light radius `d` that ensures full coverage.",
