            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. Each string is of the form \"digit suit\", but note: the input is three separate strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" and each tile is represented by two characters.\n\n Actually, looking at the example input format, it might be that the input is given as one line with three space-separated two-character strings? Or maybe the entire input is three tokens (each token being a two-character string) separated by spaces?\n\n However, the example input is shown as:\n     Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the problem says \"The only line\" so we read one line. Then we have to split that line.\n\n Let me clarify: the example input has three examples, but the problem expects one input line. The sample input for one test case would be:\n\n Example 1: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n Example 2: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n Example 3: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n However, the problem states that there is one line containing three strings. So the input line might look like: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n But wait, the example output is printed as three separate answers? Actually, the example output is:\n\n     ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This implies that there are three test cases? Or is the input actually providing three test cases?\n\n Let me reread the problem statement: \n     \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n And then the example input is given as three separate examples. But the problem says:\n\n     Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n So actually, the input is one line with three tiles? Or one line with three pairs (each tile is two characters, and the whole line is six characters?).\n\n Actually, the example input format is ambiguous. But looking at the example:\n\n     Input: \n          ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n     Output:\n          ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This suggests that the input is multiple test cases? But the problem says \"The only line\".\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be giving three examples, but the actual code should handle one test case at a time.\n\n However, the problem statement says: \"The only line contains three strings\". So we read one line, split by space to get three two-character strings.\n\n But wait, if we split \"1s 2s 3s\" by space, we get three tokens: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\n So let's assume the input is one line with three tokens (each token is two characters). We can do:\n\n     tiles = input().split()\n\n Then we have a list of three strings, each string is two characters.\n\n Now, we have three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu.\n\n Conditions for mentsu:\n   - Either a koutsu (three identical tiles) OR a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n Since we can draw any tiles (and we can draw as many as we want), we are allowed to consider drawing more than one tile.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if we already have a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) then answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles (because with 3 draws we can complete two mentsus? Actually, we only need one mentsu, so we don't necessarily need to complete two. But note: we start with 3 tiles, and we can draw up to 2 more to have 5 tiles, but we don't require a complete hand, just having at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't require to complete the whole hand, just to have at least one mentsu. So we can use some of the drawn tiles to form a mentsu and leave the rest as they are.\n\n But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. The goal is to minimize the number of draws.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: With 0 draws, no mentsu.\n\n Then we consider:\n\n   Option 1: Draw 1 tile. Then we have 4 tiles. Can we form a mentsu? We need to check if by adding one tile we can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\n   Option 2: Draw 2 tiles.\n\n   Option 3: Draw 3 tiles.\n\n But note: we can also consider forming a mentsu by using some of the existing tiles and the drawn ones.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to choose any tiles. So we can choose the best ones.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We can break down the hand into counts per tile type (considering suit and number). But note: tiles from different suits are distinct.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Represent the hand as a multiset of tiles. Each tile is a tuple (number, suit). The number is an integer from 1 to 9, the suit is one of 'm','p','s'.\n\n 2. Check for koutsu: any tile that appears at least 3 times? But wait, we have three tiles. So if there are three identical, then koutsu.\n\n    Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> koutsu.\n\n 3. Check for shuntsu: we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. But note: the hand might not be three distinct tiles. However, we have exactly three tiles. For a shuntsu we need three distinct tiles (but we can have duplicates? Actually, for a shuntsu we need three distinct numbers, but the hand might have duplicates? \n\n    Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> shuntsu.\n    Example: ['1m','1m','2m','3m'] -> then we can form a shuntsu with two of the '1m' and the '2m','3m'? No, because the definition requires three sequential numbered tiles. So we cannot use the same tile twice.\n\n    Therefore, for shuntsu we require three distinct tiles (same suit, consecutive numbers). However, note the example [5p, 4p, 6p] is valid. Also, note that the order does not matter.\n\n    But in our hand of three tiles, we must have three distinct tiles (if we are going to form a shuntsu without drawing) then they must be consecutive and same suit.\n\n    However, what if we have two same tiles? Then we cannot form a shuntsu from three distinct numbers.\n\n    So for the initial hand (three tiles) we can have:\n\n        Case A: Three same -> koutsu (already covered)\n        Case B: Three distinct: then check if they are consecutive and same suit.\n\n    But note: the three distinct tiles might not be consecutive. Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> not consecutive.\n\n    So the initial hand might not form a mentsu.\n\n 4. If no mentsu, then we consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles.\n\n However, note: we might have multiple possibilities. We are to find the minimum number of draws.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   - Drawing 0: already checked.\n\n   - Drawing 1: we can add one tile. Then we have four tiles. We need to check if we can form a mentsu.\n\n        Possibilities for a mentsu with four tiles:\n\n        a) Triplet: if we have two of a particular tile, then adding one more makes three. But note: we can only use one triplet (we don't care about the rest). However, we might have multiple ways.\n\n        b) Sequence: if we have two tiles that are consecutive and we add the missing one, then we have a sequence.\n\n   - Drawing 2: similarly, we can complete a triplet (if we have two of a tile, then we need one more, so two draws? Actually, no: if we have two of a tile, then one draw completes the triplet. So two draws would be for something else? Or for a sequence? \n\n        For a sequence: if we have two non-consecutive tiles, then we might need two draws to complete a sequence? Actually, no: we need the middle one. Example: [1m, 3m] -> then we need 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have four tiles then: [1m,3m,2m] and then we have a sequence. So two draws: we drew two tiles? Actually, we draw one tile (the 2m) and then we have four tiles: [1m,3m,2m] and the third tile (which is not used) remains. But wait, the initial hand was [1m,3m] (but we started with three tiles). \n\n        Actually, we start with three tiles. So if we have three tiles, and we draw one, we have four. Then we can form a mentsu if:\n\n            - There is a tile such that we now have three of them (triplet).\n            - Or, there is a sequence (three consecutive in the same suit) among the four.\n\n        Similarly, with two draws: we have five tiles. Then we can form a mentsu.\n\n        However, note: we don't have to use all the tiles. We only need one mentsu.\n\n        Example: with two draws, we can try to form a triplet: if we have two of a tile, then we draw two more of that tile? Then we have four of that tile, which includes a triplet. But wait, we only need three. So if we have two, then one draw is enough to make a triplet.\n\n        So why would we ever need two draws? \n\n        Consider: We have three tiles that are not forming a mentsu. We might not have any duplicate and the numbers are not consecutive.\n\n        Possibility 1: We have two tiles of the same kind, but the third is different. Then drawing one of the same kind gives a triplet. So one draw is enough.\n\n        Possibility 2: We have three tiles that are of the same suit but not consecutive. Then we can draw one tile to complete the sequence? \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] (three tiles). We can draw 3m to complete [1m,2m,3m] (then we have [1m,2m,4m,3m]) -> so one draw.\n\n        Possibility 3: We have two tiles that are consecutive (but not the third) and we need the third to complete the sequence. Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can draw 3m (same as above). \n\n        What if we don't have two consecutive? Example: [1m,3m,5m] (same suit). Then we can draw 2m and 4m? But wait, we only need one mentsu. We don't require to form two. However, we can form a triplet by drawing two of one of these? \n\n        But note: we can draw any tiles. So we can choose to form a triplet: we can draw two copies of 1m (if we have one 1m) then we have three 1m. Alternatively, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles to complete two different sequences? Actually, no: we need only one mentsu.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best option.\n\n        Let me think: we have [1m,3m,5m] (same suit). We can draw two tiles: two 2m and 4m? Then we have [1m,3m,5m,2m,4m]. Now we have two sequences: [1m,2m,3m] and [3m,4m,5m] (but wait, we have only one 3m). So that doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, we can draw two of the same tile: say two 1m. Then we have [1m,3m,5m,1m,1m]. Then we have a triplet (1m) and also we can form a sequence? Actually, we have three 1m (so a triplet) and the other tiles are 3m and 5m. So we have a mentsu.\n\n        So two draws are enough.\n\n        But wait, is there a way with one draw? One draw: we can draw one tile. Then we have four tiles.\n\n            Option 1: Draw 1m -> [1m,1m,3m,5m]: we have a triplet (1m) -> valid.\n            Option 2: Draw 2m -> [1m,2m,3m,5m]: we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m] -> valid.\n\n        So actually, one draw is enough. Why did I think two draws? Because I thought we needed to complete two sequences? But we don't. We only need one.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of draws is 1.\n\n        So the algorithm must consider: we can complete a triplet by drawing one (if we have two of a kind) or we can complete a sequence by drawing one (if we have two consecutive in the same suit, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one).\n\n        However, note: the hand has three tiles. We can also consider the possibility of forming a triplet by drawing two of a tile that we have one of? Then we have one + two = three. That's one draw (if we have one, then we draw two, so two draws). But wait, we can also draw one and then we have two, which is not enough. Then we need to draw two for a triplet if we start with one.\n\n        Actually, for a triplet:\n\n            - If we have three of a kind: 0 draws.\n            - If we have two of a kind: then one draw (to get the third).\n            - If we have one of a kind: then we need to draw two (to get two more) to complete the triplet.\n\n        But wait, we can also form a sequence. So we must consider both possibilities.\n\n        Similarly, for a sequence (shuntsu):\n\n            - We need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n            - We have three tiles. They must be three distinct numbers (same suit) and consecutive.\n\n            - How to complete a sequence from three tiles?\n\n                Let the tiles be (a, b, c) in the same suit. We can have:\n\n                Case 1: They are consecutive -> 0 draws.\n\n                Case 2: They are not consecutive, but two of them are consecutive and the third is adjacent to one of them? Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can draw 3m.\n\n                Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> we can draw 2m.\n\n                Example: [1m,2m,5m] -> we can draw 3m or 4m? Actually, we can form two different sequences: [1m,2m,3m] (by drawing 3m) or [2m,3m,4m] (but we don't have 3m and 4m) so only one option: drawing 3m.\n\n                But wait, we can also form a triplet if we have duplicates? Actually, we don't have duplicates. So we have to rely on the sequence.\n\n                However, note: we can also form a sequence by drawing two tiles? Not necessary if we can complete with one.\n\n                But what if we have two separate pairs that are almost sequences? Actually, we are only concerned with one mentsu.\n\n                However, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best way to complete one mentsu.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: we have three tiles. We can draw 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles.\n\n        We need to compute the minimum number of draws to form at least one mentsu.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let tiles = [t1, t2, t3]\n\n        Step 1: Check if there is a koutsu (three identical) -> then 0.\n\n        Step 2: Check if there is a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit) -> then 0.\n\n        Step 3: Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles.\n\n        We can consider:\n\n          Option 1: Draw 1 tile.\n\n            We can form a koutsu if there is a tile that appears twice (then we draw one more). Or we can form a shuntsu if there are two tiles of the same suit and we can complete the sequence by drawing one tile.\n\n          Option 2: Draw 2 tiles.\n\n            We can form a koutsu if there is a tile that appears once (then we draw two more). Or we can form a shuntsu if we have two tiles that are part of a sequence (but missing two) OR we have two separate pairs that are consecutive but not complete? Actually, we can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles (if the existing two are not consecutive and we need two to complete the sequence). Also, we can complete a triplet by drawing two (if we have one of a kind).\n\n          Option 3: Draw 3 tiles.\n\n            We can always form a koutsu by drawing three of a tile (if we have zero of a tile, we can draw three of that tile). But wait, we can also form a sequence by drawing three tiles? Actually, we can form a sequence by drawing three tiles if we have no base. However, we can also form a triplet.\n\n            But note: we can form a mentsu by drawing three tiles (if we don't have any base, we can choose to form a triplet: take three of one kind, or a sequence: take three consecutive in one suit). However, we might be able to do it with fewer.\n\n        However, we are to find the minimum.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n          Let f(0) = 0 if there's already a mentsu, else we try to see if 1 draw is enough, then 2, then 3.\n\n        How to check for 1 draw:\n\n          Condition for koutsu: \n            Count the frequency of each tile. If any tile appears 2 times, then we can draw one more of that tile to complete the triplet.\n\n          Condition for shuntsu:\n            Group by suit. For a given suit, if we have at least two distinct numbers, then we can check the gaps. We need to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers. \n\n            In the same suit, we have a set of numbers (say {a, b, c} or {a, b} or {a, a, b} etc). \n\n            We can try to see if we can complete a sequence by drawing one tile.\n\n            Steps for shuntsu with one draw:\n\n              - We must have two tiles of the same suit, say with numbers x and y (x != y). Then we can complete the sequence if there exists a number z such that (min(x,y) <= z <= max(x,y)) and the set {x, y, z} forms a consecutive sequence of three. But note: we might have three tiles, so we have to consider the entire hand.\n\n            Actually, we have three tiles. It's possible that the three tiles are from different suits, so we have to group by suit.\n\n            For each suit, let S be the set of numbers (without duplicates) in that suit. Then the total distinct numbers in that suit is |S|.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can add one number to this suit.\n\n            We want to know: is there a suit S and a number z such that the set S ∪ {z} contains three consecutive numbers?\n\n            However, we are allowed to use the entire hand (three tiles) and the drawn tile. We don't need to use all the tiles. But the drawn tile must be in the same suit as S.\n\n            Example: hand = [1m, 2m, 3p] (suit m has [1,2], suit p has [3]). Then we can draw 0p to form [1m,2m,3p,0p] -> but wait, we cannot draw 0p. Numbers are from 1 to 9.\n\n            Actually, we can draw 3m? Then we have [1m,2m,3p,3m]. Now, the suit m has [1,2,3] -> consecutive. So we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have two 3m? Actually, no, we have one 3m and one 3p. So the sequence is [1m,2m,3m] and we have the tile 3m.\n\n            However, note: the hand originally was [1m,2m,3p]. We draw 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3p,3m]. The sequence [1m,2m,3m] uses the 1m, 2m, and the 3m we just drew.\n\n            So the condition: in the same suit, we have two numbers that are consecutive and we are missing the third, and the third is in the range [min, max] (and within 1-9).\n\n            Alternatively, we can think:\n\n                For a fixed suit, let the distinct numbers we have be D (sorted). Then we can consider:\n\n                    - If |D| >= 2, then we can check the gaps. We want to know if we can complete a consecutive triple by adding one number.\n\n                    Example: D = [1,2] -> we can add 0 or 3? But 0 is invalid. 3: then we have [1,2,3] -> consecutive. So yes.\n\n                    Example: D = [1,3] -> we can add 2: then [1,2,3] -> consecutive.\n\n                    Example: D = [1,4] -> we can add 2 or 3 or 5? \n                        Adding 2: [1,2,4] -> not consecutive.\n                        Adding 3: [1,3,4] -> not consecutive.\n                        Adding 5: [1,4,5] -> not consecutive.\n                    So no.\n\n                    Example: D = [2,3,4] -> already consecutive? Then we don't need to draw. But wait, we have three distinct numbers, so we have the sequence [2,3,4]. Then we don't need to draw. But wait, we already checked for three distinct consecutive? Actually, we did step 2: we check for shuntsu (three consecutive). So if we have three consecutive distinct, then we have a shuntsu and we would have returned 0.\n\n            However, note: we are checking for 1 draw. So we must have already failed the 0-draw check.\n\n            Therefore, in the 1-draw check for shuntsu, we are assuming that the three tiles do not form a shuntsu. So we don't have three consecutive in one suit.\n\n            But we might have two tiles in one suit that are consecutive and the third tile is in a different suit. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the third tile (in that suit) to form a consecutive set.\n\n            So algorithm for 1-draw shuntsu:\n\n              For each suit, consider the distinct numbers present in that suit.\n\n              For a given suit, if the count of distinct numbers is 2, then let the two numbers be a and b (a < b). Then the consecutive triple we can form is either (a-1, a, b) if a-1 is between 1 and 9 and a-1 is not present? But wait, we can only draw one tile. We need to complete the consecutive triple. The triple must be three consecutive numbers. So the two numbers we have must be two of three consecutive numbers.\n\n              Example: we have (1,2) -> we need 3 to complete (1,2,3) OR we need 0 to complete (0,1,2) -> but 0 is invalid. So we need 3.\n\n              Example: we have (1,3) -> we need 2 to complete (1,2,3). \n\n              Example: we have (2,3) -> we need 1 to complete (1,2,3) OR 4 to complete (2,3,4). But wait, 1 is available? Yes, if we draw 1, then we have [1,2,3]. Similarly, drawing 4 we have [2,3,4].\n\n              Example: we have (8,9) -> we can complete (7,8,9) by drawing 7, or (8,9,10) -> invalid.\n\n              So for two numbers (a,b) (with a<b), the required number to complete a consecutive triple is:\n\n                  Option 1: a-1, if a-1 >= 1 and a-1 <= 9, and a-1 is not in the set (but we don't care about duplicates because we can draw one even if we have it, but wait: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. However, the condition is that we are going to have a set of four tiles (the original three and the drawn one). We can use the drawn tile to complete the sequence, and we don't mind if we have duplicates? Actually, the definition of shuntsu requires three distinct tiles. So we cannot use the same tile twice.\n\n              Therefore, the drawn tile must be distinct from the existing ones. However, note: we are only concerned with forming one mentsu. The rest of the tiles can be anything.\n\n              But wait: the definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. It does not require the three tiles to be distinct from the rest of the hand. However, we have three distinct tiles in the hand initially, and we are drawing one. The drawn tile must be distinct from the ones we use in the sequence? Actually, the hand can have duplicates, but the mentsu (the sequence) requires three distinct tiles.\n\n              However, we are allowed to use the same tile only once. So if we have two 1m, then we can use one of them and the drawn 2m and 3m to form a sequence? But wait, the hand after drawing would be: [1m,1m, ... , 2m, 3m]. Then we have two 1m. We can use one 1m, and then 2m and 3m. That is valid.\n\n              But note: the definition says \"three sequential numbered tiles\", and they must be in the same suit. It doesn't say they must be distinct from each other? Actually, they are distinct by number (since consecutive numbers are distinct). However, the same tile (duplicate) is represented by the same string. So two 1m are identical, but we cannot use two 1m in the same mentsu? Actually, the mentsu requires three distinct tiles. But wait, the definition says \"three sequential numbered tiles\", meaning three tiles with numbers n, n+1, n+2. The same tile (like two 1m) would break the distinctness of the numbers? \n\n              Let me check: the example [1m,1m,1m] is a koutsu (not a shuntsu). So the shuntsu must have distinct numbers. Therefore, we cannot use duplicate numbers in the same mentsu.\n\n              But wait, the problem says: \"A shuntsu is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit\". So the numbers must be sequential, hence distinct.\n\n              Therefore, in the hand, we cannot use two 1m in a shuntsu.\n\n              So when we have two 1m, we can use one 1m and then we need 2m and 3m (if we are forming [1m,2m,3m]). But we don't have 2m and 3m. We have two 1m and then we draw 2m and 3m? Then we have a shuntsu.\n\n              However, that requires two draws.\n\n              But for one draw: we can only draw one tile. Then we can complete a triplet (if we have two 1m) by drawing one more 1m. Or we can complete a sequence by drawing a tile that is adjacent to one of the numbers (if we have two distinct numbers in the same suit that are consecutive, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one).\n\n              So for one draw, we have two conditions:\n\n                Condition 1: There is a tile that appears at least two times. Then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more.\n\n                Condition 2: There is a suit that has at least two distinct numbers, and the two numbers are consecutive or separated by one gap (so that we can complete the consecutive triple by drawing one tile). \n\n              However, note: we might have two distinct numbers that are not consecutive, but we can complete the sequence by drawing the middle one.\n\n              Example: [1m,3m] (and the third tile is in a different suit). Then we can draw 2m to complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m]. \n\n              But wait, the hand has three tiles. We must account for the third tile. The third tile is not in the suit m? Then we have [1m,3m, X] (X is from another suit). Then we draw 2m. Then we have [1m,3m,X,2m]. The sequence [1m,2m,3m] uses the 1m, the drawn 2m, and the 3m. \n\n              But note: the hand originally had three tiles, so we have [1m,3m,X] and we draw 2m. Then we have four tiles. The sequence uses three of them (1m,2m,3m). The X is left. That's allowed.\n\n              So the condition for shuntsu in one draw:\n\n                For a given suit, let the distinct numbers present be D (sorted). Then we can complete a consecutive triple if:\n\n                  There exists a consecutive triple (n, n+1, n+2) such that two of these numbers are in D, and the third is between 1 and 9.\n\n                Example: D = [1,3] -> the consecutive triple [1,2,3] has two numbers (1 and 3) and 2 is missing. So we can complete by drawing 2.\n\n                Example: D = [2,3] -> the consecutive triples that include [2,3] are [0,1,2] (invalid because 0 and 1 are out of [1,9] for 0 and 1 is not consecutive with 2? Actually, [0,1,2] is invalid because 0 is not allowed. The other triple is [1,2,3] (missing 1) and [2,3,4] (missing 4). So we can complete by drawing 1 or 4.\n\n                Example: D = [1,2] -> the consecutive triples that include [1,2] are [0,1,2] (invalid) and [1,2,3] (missing 3). So we can complete by drawing 3.\n\n                Example: D = [8,9] -> the consecutive triples that include [8,9] are [7,8,9] (missing 7) and [8,9,10] (invalid). So we can complete by drawing 7.\n\n                Example: D = [1,4] -> no consecutive triple can be completed by adding one number because:\n                    To form [0,1,2] -> 0 and 2 not present and 0 invalid.\n                    [1,2,3] -> missing 2 and 3, but we can only add one.\n                    [2,3,4] -> missing 2 and 3.\n                    [3,4,5] -> missing 3 and 5, etc.\n\n                So the condition: the two numbers must be such that the gap between the smallest and largest is at most 2 (so that we can fill one gap).\n\n                Actually, the gap between min(D) and max(D) must be <= 2.\n\n                Then the consecutive triple is [min(D)-1, min(D), min(D)+1] if min(D)-1 is in [1,9] and not present? But wait, we don't require the missing number to be not present? Actually, we are allowed to draw a tile even if we have it. But wait, the definition of shuntsu requires distinct tiles. However, if we have two 2m and we are trying to form [1m,2m,3m] and we draw 1m and 3m (but that's two draws) then that's for two draws. For one draw, we can only draw one.\n\n                But note: we are only drawing one tile. So we can only fix one gap.\n\n                Therefore, the two numbers must be consecutive or have one gap in the middle.\n\n                Actually, the two numbers can be:\n\n                  Case 1: They are consecutive (gap=1): then we can extend the sequence in either direction (if the sequence is not at the boundary) by one. Example: [2,3] -> we can extend to [1,2,3] or [2,3,4].\n\n                  Case 2: They are separated by one (gap=2): then we must complete the gap. Example: [1,3] -> we complete to [1,2,3].\n\n                But note: we might have more than two distinct numbers? Actually, we are grouping by suit. The hand has three tiles, so in a suit we can have:\n\n                  - Three distinct numbers: but then we already checked for shuntsu (three consecutive) and it would have been caught in step 2. So for one-draw shuntsu, we are considering suits that do not form a consecutive triple by themselves (with the three tiles) and we are going to complete by drawing one.\n\n                  - Two distinct numbers: then we check the gap.\n\n                  - One distinct number: then we cannot form a sequence by drawing one (unless we draw two, but that's two draws).\n\n            So for a suit with two distinct numbers (a, b) (a < b):\n\n                If b - a == 1: then we can complete the sequence by drawing either a-1 (if a-1>=1) or b+1 (if b+1<=9). So at least one of these is available? Actually, we can choose any tile arbitrarily, so we can choose the one that is available (but we don't care about availability because we can draw any tile). So we can always complete the sequence by drawing one tile if the gap is 1.\n\n                If b - a == 2: then we can complete by drawing a+1 (which is the missing one).\n\n                If b - a > 2: then we cannot complete the sequence by drawing one tile.\n\n            But wait, what if we have three distinct numbers in a suit? Then we already have a shuntsu? Not necessarily: [1,2,4] is not consecutive. However, we have three distinct numbers. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing one tile? \n\n            Example: [1,2,4] (same suit). Then we can draw 3 to complete [1,2,3,4] and then we have the sequence [1,2,3] (using the drawn 3) or [2,3,4]. \n\n            But wait, we are only concerned with forming one mentsu. So we can use the drawn tile to complete either [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. \n\n            However, we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can draw 3. Then we have the sequence [1,2,3] (if we ignore the 4) or [2,3,4] (if we ignore the 1). \n\n            So the condition for a suit with three distinct numbers (and not already consecutive) is: \n\n                Let the sorted distinct numbers be [x, y, z] (with x<y<z). Then we can complete a consecutive triple by drawing one tile if:\n\n                    - The numbers are consecutive except one gap. \n\n                    Example: [1,2,4]: the gap between 2 and 4 is 2, so we can complete the gap by drawing 3.\n\n                    Example: [1,3,4]: the gap between 1 and 3 is 2, so we can complete by drawing 2.\n\n                    Example: [1,2,3]: already consecutive -> 0 draws.\n\n                    Example: [1,2,5]: gaps: 1 and 3. The gaps are not consecutive. We cannot complete by drawing one tile because:\n\n                        If we draw 3: [1,2,3,5] -> we have [1,2,3] (if we ignore 5) -> that's a consecutive triple. But wait, we have the tile 3. Then the sequence [1,2,3] is formed. So why did I say we cannot? \n\n                    Actually, we can. The condition is: the three distinct numbers must not be consecutive, but we can complete one consecutive triple by",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: If any three tiles are identical (same number and suit), then no draws are needed.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: If there are three consecutive numbers in the same suit, then no draws are needed.\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: For any suit with two distinct numbers, check if they can form a sequence by adding one number. The numbers must either be consecutive or have a gap of one (e.g., 1 and 3 can be completed with 2).\n\n3. **Check for Two Draws**:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If there is one tile of a kind, drawing two more completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: For any suit with two distinct numbers separated by more than one gap, drawing two appropriate numbers completes a sequence. Also, if no one-draw condition is met, two draws might be necessary.\n\n4. **Three Draws**: As a fallback, three draws can always form a mentsu (e.g., three identical tiles).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [t for t in data]\n\n    # Check for koutsu (triplet) or shuntsu (sequence) in the initial hand\n    tile_count = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        tile_count[tile] = tile_count.get(tile, 0) + 1\n        \n    # Check for koutsu: any tile appears three times\n    has_koutsu = False\n    for tile, count in tile_count.items():\n        if count >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    has_shuntsu = False\n    for suit in suits:\n        suit_tiles = [tile for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        if len(suit_tiles) < 3:\n            continue\n            \n        numbers = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in suit_tiles)\n        num_set = set(numbers)\n        if len(numbers) == 3:\n            if numbers[2] - numbers[0] == 2 and all(num_set[i] == numbers[i] for i in range(3)):\n                has_shuntsu = True\n                break\n                \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for one-draw possibility\n    has_one_draw = False\n\n    # Check for koutsu: any tile appears twice\n    for tile in tile_count:\n        if tile_count[tile] == 2:\n            has_one_draw = True\n            break\n\n    if not has_one_draw:\n        # Check for shuntsu with one draw\n        for suit in suits:\n            suit_tiles = [tile for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n            numbers = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in suit_tiles)\n            num_set = set(numbers)\n            if len(numbers) == 2:\n                a, b = numbers\n                if b - a == 1:\n                    has_one_draw = True\n                    break\n                elif b - a == 2:\n                    has_one_draw = True\n                    break\n            elif len(numbers) == 3:\n                if max(numbers) - min(numbers) == 2:\n                    has_one_draw = True\n                    break\n\n    if has_one_draw:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Check for two-draw possibility\n    has_two_draws = False\n\n    # Check for koutsu: any tile appears once\n    for tile in tile_count:\n        if tile_count[tile] == 1:\n            has_two_draws = True\n            break\n\n    if not has_two_draws:\n        # Check for shuntsu with two draws\n        for suit in suits:\n            suit_tiles = [tile for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n            numbers = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in suit_tiles)\n            num_set = set(numbers)\n            if len(numbers) >= 2:\n                if max(numbers) - min(numbers) <= 3:\n                    has_two_draws = True\n                    break\n\n    if has_two_draws:\n        print(2)\n        return\n\n    print(3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence).

This includes completing a triplet with two identical tiles or forming a sequence by adding a missing number in a suit.\n3. **Two-Draw Check**: If one draw isn't sufficient, it checks if two draws can form a mentsu. This involves completing a triplet from a single tile or forming a sequence from two distinct numbers in a suit.\n4. **Fallback to Three Draws**: If none of the above conditions are met, three draws are sufficient to form a mentsu (e.g., three identical tiles).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance even for edge cases.",
