A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime and the drink and salt per toast is for one friend. However, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. So if there are n friends, then for x toasts, each friend makes x toasts, so the total drink required is n * x * nl, the total lime slices required is n * x, and the total salt required is n * x * np.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   - The drink limits the toasts to at most (k * l) // (n * nl) because each toast for one friend uses nl, and there are n friends making x toasts each -> total drink = n * x * nl.\n\n But wait, note the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n   Here, n=3, k=4, l=5 -> total drink = 20 ml.\n   Each toast for one friend uses 3 ml, so for 3 friends having x toasts each, total drink = 3*x*3 = 9x ml.\n\n   Then 9x <= 20 -> x <= 20/9 which is about 2.22, so x=2.\n\n However, the example solution breaks it down as:\n   Total toasts from drink: 20 / 3 = 6 (because each toast (for one friend) uses 3 ml, and 6 toasts would use 18 ml, which is within 20).\n   But wait, how did they get 6? They did not multiply by n? \n\n Let me clarify the problem statement: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n That means for one toast, one friend drinks nl ml, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\n If we want to make x toasts for each friend, then the total number of toasts is n * x.\n\n But note: the example does not say that the drink is used per toast (which is one friend's toast) and then multiplied by the number of friends. Actually, the drink requirement for one toast is nl per friend? Then if one friend makes x toasts, he uses x * nl. And since there are n friends, the total drink is n * x * nl.\n\n However, the example calculation was: \n   drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / 3 (nl) = 6 toasts (meaning 6 toasts in total? because each toast uses 3 ml). \n\n But wait, the example says: \n   \"The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n And the condition is that each friend must have the same number of toasts.\n\n The example then says: \n   min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n Why divided by 3? Because 6 toasts (from drink) is the total number of toasts that can be made (since each toast uses 3 ml). But if we are making 6 toasts, then each friend would get 6 / 3 = 2 toasts? \n\n Actually, let me reexamine:\n\n In the example, one toast requires 3 ml (nl=3) for one friend. But if there are 3 friends and each toast is for one friend, then one toast uses 3 ml. However, when we have multiple friends, we can only serve one toast per friend at a time? Actually, the problem does not specify that the drink is shared or not. But note: the total drink is 20 ml, and each toast (regardless of which friend) requires 3 ml. So the total number of toasts (across all friends) is limited by 20/3 = 6 (since 6*3=18 <=20, 7*3=21>20). \n\n Then, since there are 3 friends, and they must each have the same number of toasts, the total toasts must be divisible by the number of friends? Not necessarily, but we cannot exceed the total toasts.\n\n Actually, the constraint is: \n   - We can have at most T_total toasts (across all friends) such that T_total <= (total drink)/(nl) and T_total <= (total lime slices) and T_total <= (total salt)/(np)\n\n And then, since each friend must have the same number of toasts, the number of toasts per friend is floor(T_total / n)? But wait, no: actually, the total toasts T_total must be such that T_total is divisible by n? \n\n However, note: the example does not require T_total to be divisible by n. The example says: \n   \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3\"\n\n But 6 (the drink limit) is the total toasts, and we divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get the per-friend toasts. \n\n But wait, if we have 6 total toasts and 3 friends, then each friend gets 2 toasts. This is exact.\n\n However, what if the total toasts is not divisible by n? For example, if we had 7 total toasts and 3 friends, then we cannot give each friend the same integer number of toasts (because 7/3 is not an integer). \n\n The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n So if we are to make x toasts for each friend, then the total toasts is n * x.\n\n Therefore, the constraints become:\n\n   n * x * nl <= k * l   => x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   n * x <= c * d        => x <= (c * d) / n\n   n * x * np <= p       => x <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, wait: the lime constraint: each toast (for one friend) requires 1 slice. And we have c*d slices. So the total number of toasts (across all friends) is limited by c*d. But note: the total toasts is n*x, so we require n*x <= c*d.\n\n Similarly, the drink: each toast (for one friend) requires nl, so total drink needed is n*x*nl, which must be <= k*l.\n\n And salt: each toast (for one friend) requires np grams, so total salt needed is n*x*np, which must be <= p.\n\n Then the maximum x (number of toasts per friend) is the minimum of:\n\n   x1 = (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   x2 = (c * d) / n\n   x3 = p / (n * np)\n\n But note: the example:\n\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   x1 = (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so x1 = 2 (if we take floor? but the problem says \"as many as they can\", so we take the floor because you can't make a fraction of a toast.\n\n However, wait: the example solution did:\n\n   drink: 20 / 3 = 6 (toasts in total) then divided by 3 (number of friends) -> 2.\n\n But note: the drink constraint in terms of total toasts (not per friend) is 20/3=6. Then if we have 3 friends, then the number of toasts per friend is 6/3=2.\n\n Alternatively, if we use the above formula:\n\n   x1 = 20/(3*3)=20/9≈2.22 -> floor is 2, but also we have:\n\n   x2 = (10*8)/3 = 80/3≈26.66 -> floor 26\n   x3 = 100/(3*1)=100/3≈33.33 -> floor 33\n\n Then the limiting factor is 2.\n\n So both ways: we can compute the total toasts as min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) and then divide by n (but wait, the drink and salt are per toast for one friend, so the total toasts is n*x, and the drink constraint is (n*x)*nl <= k*l -> x <= (k*l)/(n*nl). Similarly for the others.\n\n But note: the example solution did:\n\n   drink_total_toasts = (k*l) / nl   [because each toast uses nl] -> 20/3 = 6 (total toasts)\n   lime_total_toasts = c*d = 80 (total toasts)\n   salt_total_toasts = p / np = 100/1 = 100 (total toasts)\n\n Then the total toasts we can make is min(6,80,100)=6.\n\n Then the number of toasts per friend is 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n However, note: the drink constraint: if we do 6 toasts, then total drink used is 6 * nl = 6*3 = 18, which is <=20. But wait, in the example the drink constraint was calculated as 20/3 (which is 6.66) and they took 6. \n\n But if we consider the drink constraint for the entire group: we can have up to 20 // 3 = 6 toasts (using integer division? but note: 20/3 is 6.66, but we can only use whole toasts). However, the problem does not specify that we can break a toast. So we must use integer toasts.\n\n So we should use floor division for the total toasts? Or more precisely, the maximum total toasts is the minimum of:\n\n   drink_total = (k * l) // nl   [if we use integer division?] but wait: (k*l) might not be divisible by nl. However, the example did: 20/3=6.66... and then they took 6 (floor) because 7*3=21>20.\n\n But the example did not use integer division, they used real division and then took the floor implicitly? Actually, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\", meaning they used integer division (floor) for the drink.\n\n Similarly, for salt: p / np = 100/1=100, which is integer.\n\n For lime: c*d=80, which is integer.\n\n So the correct way is:\n\n   total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   ??? \n\n But wait: the drink constraint is (k*l) must be at least nl * total_toasts. Since we can't use fractions, we take floor((k*l) / nl) for the maximum total toasts from drink.\n\n However, note: if we use floor division, then (k*l)//nl is the maximum number of toasts from drink. Similarly, for salt: p//np is the maximum toasts from salt. And lime: c*d is the maximum toasts from lime.\n\n Then the total toasts we can make is the minimum of these three.\n\n Then the number of toasts per friend is total_toasts // n? \n\n But wait, the total_toasts must be divisible by n? Actually, no: we are making total_toasts across all friends, and then we distribute equally. However, the condition is that each friend must have the same number of toasts. So the total_toasts must be divisible by n? Not necessarily: we can have some toasts left over, but then we cannot distribute them equally. \n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. And we are making total_toasts (which is the sum of toasts for all friends). But the condition for the drink is: total_toasts * nl <= k*l. But if we are going to distribute the toasts equally, then the per-friend toasts must be an integer (whole number). \n\n Actually, the problem doesn't specify that we must use all the resources. We just want to maximize the number of toasts per friend (with each friend getting the same number).\n\n So we are looking for the maximum integer x (number of toasts per friend) such that:\n\n   n * x * nl <= k * l\n   n * x <= c * d\n   n * x * np <= p\n\n Then x_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n But wait, the drink constraint: n*x*nl <= k*l -> x <= (k*l) / (n*nl). Since x must be integer, we take the floor of (k*l)/(n*nl). Similarly for the others.\n\n However, note: the example:\n\n   x <= (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 -> floor(20/9)=2.\n\n   x <= (10*8) / 3 = 80/3 -> floor(80/3)=26.\n\n   x <= 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 -> floor(100/3)=33.\n\n So the answer is 2.\n\n But note: the example solution did:\n\n   drink_total_toasts = 20//3 = 6 (then divided by 3 -> 2)\n\n   This is equivalent to: \n        x = min( (k*l) // (nl * n), (c*d) // n, p // (np * n) )\n\n However, wait: the drink constraint in the example solution was done by total toasts (6) and then divided by n (3) to get 2. \n\n But note: (k*l)//nl gives the total toasts from drink, then we divide by n to get per friend? \n\n Actually, the two approaches are equivalent:\n\n   Approach 1 (per resource constraint for the entire group):\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n        x = total_toasts // n   [but wait, is this correct?]\n\n   Example: total_toasts=6, then x=6//3=2.\n\n   But consider if total_toasts=7 and n=3, then x=7//3=2 (integer division). But 7 toasts in total is not divisible by 3. However, the problem requires each friend to have the same number of toasts. So we can only make 6 toasts (because 7 is not divisible by 3) or 3 toasts (then each friend gets 1). But wait, the total toasts must be divisible by n? \n\n   Actually, no: we can have fractional toasts? No, we can't. But the condition is that each friend must have the same integer number of toasts. So the total toasts must be a multiple of n? \n\n   However, note: the example did not require the total toasts to be divisible by n. They simply divided the total toasts by n and took the floor. But that would be incorrect if the total toasts is not divisible by n.\n\n   Let me clarify with an example:\n\n      n=2, k=1, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=2, np=2.\n\n      Then the constraints:\n\n        Drink: 2*x <= 10 -> x<=5\n        Lime: 2*x <= 100 -> x<=50\n        Salt: 2*x*2 <=10 -> 4*x<=10 -> x<=2.5\n\n      Then the maximum x (by the first method) is 2 (floor(10/(2*2))=floor(10/4)=2, and 100//2=50, and 10//(2*2)=10//4=2). \n\n      Now, if we use the second method (total toasts):\n\n        total_toasts = min(10//2, 100, 10//2) = min(5,100,5)=5.\n        Then x = 5 // 2 = 2 (since 5/2=2.5 -> floor is 2). \n\n      But wait, is 2 the same? Yes, because 2 toasts per friend gives 4 toasts total, which is less than or equal to 5 (the total toasts from drink and salt) and also satisfies the other constraints.\n\n      However, note: the drink constraint: 4 toasts * 2 ml per toast (for one friend) -> wait, no: the drink constraint for the entire group is 4*x*nl = 4*2*2 = 16 ml, but we only have 10 ml. \n\n      Wait, I think I messed up the second method. \n\n      Let me recompute using the first method (per friend):\n\n        x <= (k*l) / (n*nl) = 10/(2*2)=2.5 -> floor(2.5)=2.\n\n      Now, using the second method (total toasts):\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) \n        = min(10//2, 100, 10//2) = min(5,100,5)=5.\n\n        Then the per friend toasts = total_toasts // n = 5//2=2.\n\n      But wait, the drink constraint for the entire group is: total_toasts * nl <= k*l?\n        total_toasts=5, nl=2 -> 5*2=10 <=10 -> ok.\n        But then the per friend toasts is 5/2=2.5 -> but we cannot have 2.5 toasts per friend. \n\n      However, the problem requires that each friend has the same integer number of toasts. So we cannot use 5 total toasts because that would mean one friend gets 3 and the other 2? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\", and they must have the same amount. So we must have an integer x such that n*x <= total_toasts_available (from each resource) in the same way as the first method.\n\n      The correct way is to use the first method: \n          x = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n      But wait, in the drink constraint: the total drink used is n*x*nl, which must be <= k*l. So we can use integer division for the drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) is the maximum x from drink? \n\n      Actually, no: because (k*l) // (n*nl) is the maximum x from drink, but note: (k*l) // (n*nl) is an integer floor division. \n\n      However, let me check:\n\n          We require n*x*nl <= k*l.\n\n          Then x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n          The maximum integer x is floor((k*l) / (n*nl))\n\n      Similarly for the others.\n\n      But wait, the lime constraint: n*x <= c*d -> x <= (c*d) / n -> maximum integer x is floor((c*d)/n) ?\n\n      Actually, no: if (c*d) is not divisible by n, then we can still have x = floor((c*d)/n) because n*x <= c*d.\n\n      Example: n=2, c*d=3 -> then x can be 1 (because 2*1=2<=3) and floor(3/2)=1.\n\n      Similarly, for salt: n*x*np <= p -> x <= p/(n*np) -> maximum integer x is floor(p/(n*np))\n\n      Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          x = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n      However, wait: the drink constraint: (k*l) // (n*nl) is not the same as (k*l) divided by (n*nl) and then floored. But integer division in Python for positive numbers is floor.\n\n      But note: the drink constraint: we are dividing k*l by (n*nl) and taking floor. Similarly, for lime: we are dividing c*d by n and taking floor. For salt: dividing p by (n*np) and taking floor.\n\n      However, in the example:\n\n          n=2, k=1, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=2, np=2.\n\n          x_drink = (1*10) // (2*2) = 10//4 = 2\n          x_lime = (10*10) // 2 = 100//2 = 50\n          x_salt = 10 // (2*2) = 10//4 = 2\n\n          Then x = min(2,50,2)=2.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      But wait, why in the example solution they did:\n\n          drink_total_toasts = (k*l) // nl = 20//3=6, then x=6//3=2.\n\n      This is equivalent to:\n\n          total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n          x = total_toasts // n\n\n      But note: the drink constraint in the example solution was (k*l)//nl, which is the total toasts from drink (each toast uses nl) and then they divide by n to get per friend. However, this is only valid if the drink constraint is considered per toast (and then we are distributing the toasts). But wait, the drink constraint in the example solution is: (k*l)//nl = 20//3=6. Then they say the drink allows 6 toasts. Then the lime allows 80 toasts, salt 100. Then the total toasts is 6. Then per friend: 6//3=2.\n\n      Why is that equivalent to the first method?\n\n          In the first method, we did: (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\n          In the second method, we did: total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) = min(6,80,100)=6, then x=6//3=2.\n\n      How are these two methods the same?\n\n          The first method: \n            x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)   -> x <= 20/(9) -> floor(20/9)=2.\n\n          The second method:\n            The drink constraint for the entire group is: n*x*nl <= k*l -> 3*x*3 <=20 -> 9x<=20 -> x<=20/9 -> floor(20/9)=2.\n\n          But wait, in the second method, the drink constraint is expressed as: total_toasts (which is n*x) must satisfy: total_toasts * nl <= k*l -> 6*3=18<=20 -> yes.\n\n          However, the second method does not use the same constraint for drink. The second method uses: (k*l)//nl = 20//3=6 (which is the maximum total toasts from drink) and then divides by n to get the per friend toasts.\n\n          But note: the drink constraint for the entire group is: total_toasts * nl <= k*l -> 6*3<=20 -> 18<=20 -> ok.\n\n          However, the first method uses: x <= (k*l) / (n*nl) -> 2 <= 20/9 (which is about 2.22) -> ok.\n\n          But wait, the second method does not account for the fact that the drink constraint is per toast (each toast uses nl) and the total toasts is n*x. So the drink constraint is: n*x * nl <= k*l.\n\n          The second method: \n            total_toasts = n*x <= (k*l) // nl   [because (k*l)//nl is the maximum total toasts from drink] \n            -> n*x <= (k*l)//nl   [Note: (k*l)//nl is the floor of (k*l)/nl, so it's the maximum integer total_toasts from drink]\n\n          Then x <= ((k*l)//nl) // n   [since n*x <= (k*l)//nl -> x <= ((k*l)//nl) // n] \n\n          But wait, is (k*l)//nl divisible by n? Not necessarily. \n\n          Example: k=1, l=10, nl=3 -> (k*l)//nl=10//3=3. Then n=3: x<=3//3=1.\n\n          But the first method: x <= (10) / (3*3)=10/9≈1.11 -> floor=1.\n\n          Another example: k=1, l=10, nl=3, n=2: \n            First method: x<=10/(2*3)=10/6≈1.66 -> floor=1.\n            Second method: total_toasts = 10//3=3, then x=3//2=1.\n\n          They are the same.\n\n          Why? Because:\n\n            In the second method: \n                total_toasts <= (k*l)//nl   [because total_toasts * nl <= k*l, and total_toasts is integer, so total_toasts <= floor(k*l/nl)]\n\n            Then x = total_toasts / n (but we use integer division) -> x <= total_toasts // n.\n\n            But note: total_toasts = n*x, so we require n*x <= (k*l)//nl -> x <= ((k*l)//nl) // n   (using integer division).\n\n          However, is that always the same as the first method?\n\n          First method: x <= (k*l) / (n*nl) -> x_max = floor((k*l) / (n*nl))\n\n          Second method: x <= ((k*l)//nl) // n\n\n          Are these two expressions equivalent?\n\n          Let A = k*l, B = nl, C = n.\n\n          First: floor(A / (C*B))\n          Second: floor(floor(A/B) / C)\n\n          Is floor(floor(A/B)/C) == floor(A/(B*C))?\n\n          Consider: A=20, B=3, C=3: \n            First: floor(20/(3*3))=floor(20/9)=2\n            Second: floor(floor(20/3)/3)=floor(6/3)=2.\n\n          A=10, B=3, C=2:\n            First: floor(10/(3*2))=floor(10/6)=1\n            Second: floor(floor(10/3)/2)=floor(3/2)=1.\n\n          A=10, B=3, C=3:\n            First: floor(10/(3*3))=floor(10/9)=1\n            Second: floor(floor(10/3)/3)=floor(3/3)=1.\n\n          It seems they are the same.\n\n          Why? Because:\n\n            We have: floor(floor(A/B)/C) = floor(A/(B*C))\n\n          This is a known property: floor(floor(x/y)/z) = floor(x/(y*z)) for positive integers x,y,z? \n\n          Actually, no. Let me test with non-integers: but here A, B, C are integers.\n\n          We know that for positive integers, floor division is distributive in this way? \n\n          Actually, we can use the identity: floor(floor(a/b)*c) <= floor(a/(b*c)) * (b*c) ??? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Let q = floor(A/B), then q <= A/B < q+1.\n            Then floor(q/C) <= q/C < floor(q/C)+1.\n\n            Also, A/(B*C) = (A/B)/C.\n\n            We know that floor(q/C) is an integer and is the greatest integer less than or equal to q/C.\n\n            But we also know that q <= A/B, so q/C <= A/(B*C). Therefore, floor(q/C) <= floor(A/(B*C)).\n\n            However, we need to show that floor(A/(B*C)) <= q/C? Not exactly, but we have:\n\n            Since q = floor(A/B), then A/B >= q, so A/(B*C) >= q/C.\n\n            But then floor(A/(B*C)) is at least floor(q/C) because A/(B*C) >= q/C.\n\n            However, we don't have an upper bound on A/(B*C) from q? \n\n          Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let x = A/(B*C). Then floor(x) is the greatest integer <= x.\n\n            Also, q = floor(A/B) = floor(B*C*x/B) = floor(C*x) ??? Not exactly.\n\n          Instead, we can use the fact that:\n\n            floor(floor(A/B)/C) = floor(A/(B*C))\n\n          holds for positive integers A, B, C. \n\n          Proof sketch:\n\n            Let q = floor(A/B). Then q <= A/B < q+1.\n\n            Then q/C <= A/(B*C) < (q+1)/C.\n\n            Now, we need to show that floor(q/C) = floor(A/(B*C)).\n\n            Note that A/(B*C) is in the interval [q/C, (q+1)/C).\n\n            The floor of A/(B*C) is the greatest integer <= A/(B*C). \n\n            Also, floor(q/C) is the greatest integer <= q/C.\n\n            But note: the entire interval [q/C, (q+1)/C) might contain an integer greater than floor(q/C) if (q+1)/C is greater than floor(q/C)+1.\n\n            However, consider:\n\n              Let m = floor(q/C). Then m <= q/C < m+1.\n\n              Then A/(B*C) is in [q/C, (q+1)/C). \n\n              Since q/C < m+1, then (q+1)/C might be >= m+1 or < m+1.\n\n            Example: q=10, C=3 -> m = floor(10/3)=3, then (q+1)/C=11/3≈3.66, so the interval [10/3≈3.33, 3.66) contains 3 and 4? No, 3.33 to 3.66: the integers in this interval are 3 (if we consider floor) but wait, the floor of 3.33 is 3, and the floor of 3.66 is 3. So the floor of any number in [3.33,3.66) is 3.\n\n            How about if we have q=10, C=4: m=floor(10/4)=2, then the interval [10/4=2.5, 11/4=2.75) -> floor is 2.\n\n            But wait, we are comparing to floor(q/C)=2, and the entire interval [2.5,2.75) has floor=2.\n\n            Actually, the floor of A/(B*C) is the same as the floor of q/C because:\n\n              A/(B*C) is in [q/C, (q+1)/C)\n\n              And note that (q+1)/C = q/C + 1/C.\n\n            The floor of numbers in [q/C, (q+1)/C) is:\n\n              If (q+1)/C <= floor(q/C)+1, then the entire interval [q/C, (q+1)/C) lies in [floor(q/C), floor(q/C)+1), so the floor is floor(q/C).\n\n            But if (q+1)/C > floor(q/C)+1, then the interval [q/C, (q+1)/C) might extend beyond floor(q/C)+1, so the floor of numbers in the part [floor(q/C)+1, (q+1)/C) would be floor(q/C)+1, but wait: \n\n            Example: q=10, C=3: then (q+1)/C=11/3≈3.66, and floor(q/C)=3, so 3.66 is greater than 3+1=4? No, 3.66<4.\n\n            Example: q=11, C=3: then (q+1)/C=12/3=4, which is exactly 4. Then the interval [11/3≈3.66,4) -> floor of numbers in [3.66,4) is 3, and floor(q/C)=floor(11/3)=3.\n\n            Example: q=12, C=3: then (q+1)/C=13/3≈4.33, and floor(q/C)=4. Then the interval [4,4.33) -> floor is 4.\n\n            Example: q=13, C=3: then (q+1)/C=14/3≈4.66, and floor(q/C)=4. Then the interval [13/3≈4.22,4.66) -> floor is 4.\n\n            So it always holds that floor(A/(B*C)) = floor(q/C) = floor(floor(A/B)/C)\n\n          Therefore, we can use either:\n\n            Method 1:\n                x = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            Method 2:\n                total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n                x = total_toasts // n\n\n          Both are equivalent.\n\n      However, note: the constraints for lime and salt are:\n\n          In Method 1: \n            lime: (c*d) // n   [because n*x <= c*d -> x <= (c*d)//n (using integer floor division)]\n          In Method 2:\n            total_toasts (for lime) is c*d, then x = c*d // n.\n\n          So for lime, they are the same.\n\n          Similarly, for salt: \n            Method 1: p // (n*np)\n            Method 2: total_toasts_salt = p // np, then x = (p//np) // n.\n\n          And we just proved that (p//np)//n = p//(n*np) (by the same identity).\n\n      Therefore, we can use either.\n\n      But note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and not exceeding 1000.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the drink constraint in Method 1: (k*l) // (n*nl) is the same as (k*l)//nl // n (by the identity) but wait, we just proved that floor(floor(A/B)/C)=floor(A/(B*C)). \n\n      So we can do:\n\n        Option 1:\n          drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n          lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n          salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n          ans = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n        Option 2:\n          total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl\n          total_lime_toasts = c * d\n          total_salt_toasts = p // np\n          total_toasts = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n          ans = total_toasts // n\n\n      Both are acceptable.\n\n      Let me choose Option 2 because the example solution used that and it's straightforward.\n\n      However, note: the example solution did:\n\n          drink: 4*5=20 -> 20/3=6 (so they",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible across all friends while ensuring each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast for one friend consumes `nl` milliliters of drink, one lime slice, and `np` grams of salt. The total resources available are:\n   - Drink: `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Lime slices: `c * d` slices.\n   - Salt: `p` grams.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor is the resource that allows the fewest toasts when considering all friends. The total number of toasts is constrained by:\n   - The drink: `(k * l) // nl` (each toast uses `nl` milliliters).\n   - The lime slices: `c * d` (each toast uses one slice).\n   - The salt: `p // np` (each toast uses `np` grams).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the maximum toasts possible from each resource.\n   - Taking the minimum of these values to get the total toasts that can be made by all friends combined.\n   - Dividing this total by the number of friends to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts (using integer division).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt_toasts = p // np\n    \n    total_toasts = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_slices, total_salt_toasts)\n    ans = total_toasts // n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, and the required drink and salt per toast.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: The total toasts possible from the drink is calculated by dividing the total milliliters (`k * l`) by the milliliters per toast (`nl`), using integer division.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total toasts possible from lime slices is simply the total number of slices (`c * d`), as each toast requires one slice.\n   - **Salt**: The total toasts possible from salt is calculated by dividing the total grams (`p`) by the grams per toast (`np`), using integer division.\n3. **Determine Total Toasts**: The minimum value among the three resource calculations gives the maximum number of toasts that can be made collectively by all friends.\n4. **Per Friend Toasts**: The total toasts are divided by the number of friends (`n`) using integer division to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages integer division to handle discrete resource constraints and ensures equitable distribution among friends.",
