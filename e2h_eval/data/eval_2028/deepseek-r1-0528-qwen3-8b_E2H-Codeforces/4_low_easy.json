The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of rounds `n`, then two strings A and B (the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that each player uses a cyclic sequence. Therefore, the entire game can be broken down into cycles of length L = lcm(m, k) or simply we can consider the periodicity of pairs (i, j) from the two sequences.\n\n However, note: In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n The outcome of a round is determined by the pair (A[i % m], B[i % k]). We need to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over n rounds.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute the outcomes for one full cycle of both sequences. The cycle length in terms of rounds is L = lcm(m, k). But note: we don't need to compute the actual L if we use the fact that the pattern repeats every T rounds, where T is the least common multiple of m and k? Actually, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles and a remainder.\n\n However, note: the two sequences have independent cycles. The state (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every T rounds, where T = lcm(m, k). So the entire game has period T.\n\n But wait: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1. In round i:\n   a = A[i % m]\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n Then the pair (i mod m, i mod k) does not necessarily repeat with period T? Actually, the condition for the pair (x,y) is that x = i mod m, y = i mod k. The sequence of pairs (x,y) will repeat every T rounds, where T is the least common multiple of m and k.\n\n However, note: the round index i is the same for both. The mapping from i to (x,y) is (i mod m, i mod k). The sequence of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) has period T = lcm(m, k). \n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let T = lcm(m, k)\n   Then, we can simulate the first T rounds (which is at most 1000*1000, but m,k <=1000 -> T <= 1000*1000/ gcd(m,k) which might be large, but note m,k<=1000 so T <= 1000000, which is acceptable for n=2e9? Actually, 1000000 is 1e6, and we can store an array of size T (which is 1e6) and then use it to count the outcomes over T rounds, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\n But wait: n can be 2e9, and T can be as large as 1000000, which is acceptable to precompute for one cycle? Yes, because 1e6 is acceptable in memory and time (we can do one pass of T).\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid storing T rounds if we use a dictionary or something to count the outcomes for each distinct pair (a, b) and then use the frequency of each pair in the cycle.\n\n However, note: the outcome depends on the pair (a, b). We can precompute a function f(a, b) that returns:\n   If a beats b: then a wins, so the loss goes to the opponent.\n   Otherwise, if b beats a: then b wins, so the loss goes to the other.\n   Else (draw): no loss.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the total red spots (losses) for each player.\n\n How the outcome is defined?\n   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n So for a round where Nikephoros plays a and Polycarpus plays b:\n\n   If a == b: draw -> no loss.\n\n   Else:\n      if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs, then the winner is a, so b loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n      else: then a loses -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n But note: we have three items. The winning pairs are:\n   (R, S) -> R wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n   (S, P) -> S wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n   (P, R) -> P wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n   The losing pairs (from the perspective of the first player) are:\n   (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute the results efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, each with their own cyclic sequence of moves (rock, paper, or scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current move of each player. The challenge is to count the total losses over `n` rounds without simulating each round individually.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to simulate one full cycle of `T` rounds and then use the results to compute the total losses for `n` rounds by considering complete cycles and any remaining rounds after the last complete cycle.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period `T`.\n   - **Simulation**: For each round in one period `T`, determine the winner or if the round is a draw, and accumulate the losses for each player.\n   - **Scaling**: Multiply the losses from one period by the number of complete cycles in `n` rounds. Then, simulate the remaining rounds (if any) to add the corresponding losses.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging periodicity. The simulation of one period `T` is feasible since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, making `T` at most 1,000,000, which is manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    losses_Nike = 0\n    losses_Poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        idx_A = i % m\n        idx_B = i % k\n        a = A[idx_A]\n        b = B[idx_B]\n        \n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            losses_Poly += 1\n        else:\n            losses_Nike += 1\n            \n    num_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    total_Nike = num_cycles * losses_Nike\n    total_Poly = num_cycles * losses_Poly\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idx_A = i % m\n        idx_B = i % k\n        a = A[idx_A]\n        b = B[idx_B]\n        \n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            total_Poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_Nike += 1\n            \n    print(total_Nike, total_Poly)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and two strings `A` and `B` representing the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The period `T` is calculated as the LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` to determine the repeating pattern of moves.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round in one period `T`, the current moves of both players are determined using modulo arithmetic. The outcome of each round (win, loss, or draw) is evaluated based on the game rules.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The total losses for each player are computed by multiplying the losses from one period by the number of complete periods in `n` rounds. The remaining rounds (if any) are simulated separately to account for partial periods.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large constraint on `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance without direct simulation of each round.",
