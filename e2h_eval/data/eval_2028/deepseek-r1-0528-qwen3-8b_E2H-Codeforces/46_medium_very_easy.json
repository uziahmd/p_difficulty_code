    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The subsegment must be strictly increasing after the change (if we change one number, then the entire segment must be strictly increasing).\n\n Approach:\n We can break the problem into two cases:\n 1. Without changing any number, the longest strictly increasing subsegment.\n 2. With changing exactly one number.\n\n However, note that sometimes we can fix a non-strictly increasing part by changing one number.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define:\n   left[i]: length of the increasing subsegment ending at i (without any change)\n   right[i]: length of the increasing subsegment starting at i (without any change)\n\n Then, without change, the maximum is max_i(left[i] + right[i] - 1) but wait: actually, if we have an increasing segment from i to j, then left[j] = j-i+1 and right[i] = j-i+1, so the total for that segment is j-i+1. But note: we can also consider segments that are already strictly increasing.\n\n Now, when we are allowed to change one number, we can think about the following:\n\n Consider a segment that has exactly one \"break\" (i.e., one pair (i, i+1) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]). Then we can change one of the numbers to fix the break.\n\n However, note that the break might be fixed by either:\n   - Changing the element at the break (the one that breaks the increasing order) or\n   - Sometimes we can change an adjacent element and merge with surrounding increasing parts.\n\n Actually, the idea is:\n\n Let dp[i][0] be the length of the increasing segment ending at i with no changes used so far.\n Let dp[i][1] be the length of the increasing segment ending at i with exactly one change used.\n\n But n can be up to 10^5 so we need an O(n) solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let L[i] = length of the increasing segment ending at i (without any change). Then:\n   L[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1: \n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            L[i] = L[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            L[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, let R[i] = length of the increasing segment starting at i (without any change). Then:\n   R[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            R[i] = 1\n\n Then, we can consider:\n\n Case 1: Entirely without change: answer = max_{i} (L[i] + R[i] - 1) [but note: actually the entire segment from i-L[i]+1 to i has length L[i], but we can also use the two arrays to get the entire increasing segment? Actually, we can compute the entire increasing segment by storing the consecutive increasing parts. But note: the above L and R are for contiguous increasing without breaks. So the entire segment from i-L[i]+1 to i is increasing and has length L[i].]\n\n However, we are allowed to change one number. Then we can consider:\n\n Case 2: Change one number. We can look for segments that have at most one break.\n\n We can traverse and check for breaks. But note: we can only change one number, so we can fix one break.\n\n How to combine?\n\n Idea: Consider the possibility that we can merge two increasing segments that are almost increasing by one change.\n\n For example, consider three indices: i, i+1, i+2.\n\n Suppose we have:\n   [ ... , a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], ... ]\n\n And we know that the segment ending at i is increasing and the segment starting at i+2 is increasing, but the entire segment from i to i+2 has a break at i+1 (because a[i] <= a[i+1] is false, but we don't know about a[i] and a[i+2]? Actually, we can only fix one number.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Fix an element in the middle. Then the entire segment would be broken at two points? Actually, we can fix one element and then check if the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Let's say we are going to consider a segment that spans from index i to j. We are allowed to change one element. Then the condition is that the entire segment must be strictly increasing except for at most one drop (which we fix by changing one element). \n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. So we can change one element to any integer. Therefore, we can fix the segment by ensuring that the entire segment has at most one violation (i.e., one adjacent pair that is not strictly increasing) and then we can change one element to fix that violation.\n\n But note: changing one element might fix two violations if it is adjacent to two drops.\n\n Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n   Without change: \n        1<3 -> ok, 3>2 -> violation, 2<4 -> ok.\n   We can change the 3 to 0 -> [0,3,2,4] -> then 0<3, 3>2 -> still violation at 3 and 2.\n   Or change the 2 to 3 -> [1,3,3,4] -> not strictly increasing because 3==3.\n   Or change the 2 to 4 -> [1,3,4,4] -> not strictly increasing because 4==4.\n\n Actually, wait: the example given in the note: \n   Input: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n   They changed the 1 (at index 3, which is the fourth element) to 4. Then the subsegment becomes [2,3,4,5,6] (from index 1 to 5) which is strictly increasing.\n\n How did they choose the element to change? They changed the element that was causing a break in the middle of two increasing sequences.\n\n We can consider: \n   Let's define two arrays: \n        L[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending at i (without change)\n        R[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting at i (without change)\n\n Then, if we want to form a segment that uses a change at position i, we can consider:\n\n   candidate_length = 1 (if we change a single element, the minimal segment is 1)\n\n   But more generally, we can consider merging the left part (from i - x to i-1) and the right part (from i+1 to i+y) by changing a[i] to something that fits between the left and the right.\n\n Conditions for merging:\n   We require that the left part [i - x, i-1] is increasing and the right part [i+1, i+y] is increasing.\n\n   Additionally, we require that a[i-1] < (some value) and (some value) < a[i+1]. We can set a[i] to any integer. So we can set it to be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] provided that a[i-1] < a[i+1].\n\n   Therefore, if we change a[i], then the entire segment from i-x to i+y will be strictly increasing if and only if:\n        a[i-1] < a[i+1]   (then we can choose a[i] to be between them)\n\n   Also, the entire segment must be contiguous. The total length would be (x + 1 + y).\n\n   But note: we might not have a left part or a right part.\n\n   Steps for candidate at index i (changing a[i]):\n\n        Let left_len = L[i-1]   (the increasing segment ending at i-1)\n        Let right_len = R[i+1]   (the increasing segment starting at i+1)\n\n        Then the candidate segment that includes the left part (ending at i-1), the changed a[i], and the right part (starting at i+1) is:\n            candidate = left_len + 1 + right_len   [if we change a[i]]\n\n        But we must ensure that the left part's last element (a[i-1]) is less than the right part's first element (a[i+1]), so that we can set a[i] to be between them.\n\n        If there is no left part (i-1 doesn't exist) or no right part (i+1 doesn't exist), then we can only merge one side.\n\n        Without both sides, we can still have a segment of length 1 (just the changed element) but that is trivial.\n\n   However, what if the left part exists and the right part exists but a[i-1] >= a[i+1]? Then we cannot merge the two sides by changing a[i] (because we cannot set a[i] to be both greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] if a[i-1] >= a[i+1]).\n\n   But wait, maybe we can change a[i] to a value that is not necessarily between a[i-1] and a[i+1]? Actually, no: because the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The condition for the left part is that the last element (a[i-1]) must be less than the changed a[i]. The condition for the right part is that the changed a[i] must be less than a[i+1]. Therefore, we require a[i-1] < a[i+1].\n\n   So the candidate for changing a[i] is:\n\n        candidate = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]   [if i-1 exists and i+1 exists and a[i-1] < a[i+1]]\n        candidate = L[i-1] + 1              [if i+1 doesn't exist and i-1 exists and a[i-1] < (we don't care for the right) but actually we don't need the right because we are only using the left part and the changed a[i] as the next? Actually, if there is no right part, then the condition for the right part is not needed. But note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. After changing a[i], the segment from i-1 to i must be strictly increasing: a[i-1] < changed a[i]. And since there's no right part, that's all we need.\n\n        Similarly, candidate = 1 + R[i+1]      [if i-1 doesn't exist]\n\n        Actually, if we change a[i] and there is no left part, then we can set a[i] to be less than a[i+1] (if there is a right part) or just have a single element (if no right part). But note: we can always set a[i] arbitrarily. So:\n\n        Without left part: the condition is only that if there is a right part, we set a[i] < a[i+1]. But we don't know the left part, so we don't have to worry about a left constraint. Similarly, without right part, we set a[i] > a[i-1].\n\n        However, note: the segment we are considering is from some start to some end. In the case of no left part, we can take the entire right part and include a[i] at the beginning? Actually, the segment we are forming is:\n\n          [ ... , a[i], ... ] \n\n        But if we change a[i] and there is no left part, then the segment we form is the changed a[i] and then the right part. But note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. So we require that the changed a[i] is less than the next element (if we include the next element). However, we can also consider a segment that starts at i and goes to the right, but then we are not forced to use the left part.\n\n        Actually, we are free to choose the subsegment. We are not limited to merging the immediate left and right. But note: we are trying to maximize the length.\n\n        The idea is: we can consider a segment that is entirely contained in the left part (without change) or entirely in the right part (without change) or a combination.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change at most one number, and we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment.\n\n        We can break down the possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: The entire segment is strictly increasing without any change. Then the answer is the maximum length of an increasing segment.\n\n        Possibility 2: The segment has exactly one change. Then we can consider:\n\n            Option A: The change is at the beginning or the end: then the segment is composed of an increasing segment (possibly empty on one side) and the changed element and then an increasing segment (possibly empty on the other side) that is compatible.\n\n            Option B: The change is in the middle: then we require that the two adjacent increasing segments can be merged by setting the changed element appropriately.\n\n        How to cover all?\n\n        We can iterate through each index i and consider:\n\n            candidate = max( \n                # Without change, the segment containing i (if we didn't break, then the entire increasing segment around i is already good)\n                # But wait, we are allowed to change one, so we can also consider segments that are broken and then fixed.\n\n            )\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute L and R.\n\n        Step 2: The answer without any change is max_length = max(L) [but wait, note: the entire increasing segment without change is L[i] (for each i) and we can also get the entire increasing segment by looking at the maximum value of L[i] (which is the length of the increasing segment ending at i). However, the entire segment might be longer if we consider the entire increasing run? Actually, no: the entire increasing segment from j to i (with j being the start) is of length L[i] (if we start at j and go to i, then L[i] is the length). But note: the entire increasing segment from j to i is stored in L[i] (if we start the increasing from j, then L[j]=1, then L[j+1]=2 if a[j+1]>a[j], etc.) until i.\n\n        However, the entire increasing segment that contains i is not necessarily stored in L[i] alone. We need the entire contiguous increasing segment that ends at i. But we have R[i] too: the entire increasing segment starting at i is R[i]. But that doesn't help for the entire segment.\n\n        Actually, we can compute the entire increasing segment that contains i by:\n\n            start = i\n            while start >=0 and (condition): but that is O(n) and we cannot do that for every i (n=10^5).\n\n        Instead, we can precompute:\n\n            Let L[i] = 1 if i==0, else (L[i-1]+1 if a[i] > a[i-1] else 1)\n            Let R[i] = 1 if i==n-1, else (R[i+1]+1 if a[i] < a[i+1] else 1)\n\n        Then the entire increasing segment that ends at i is of length L[i]. Similarly, the entire increasing segment that starts at i is of length R[i].\n\n        Then, without change, the maximum increasing segment is max_i (L[i] + R[i] - 1) ??? \n\n        Wait, no. Consider: [1,2,3] \n            i=0: L[0]=1, R[0]=3 -> 1+3-1=3 -> correct.\n            i=1: L[1]=2, R[1]=2 -> 2+2-1=3 -> correct.\n            i=2: L[2]=3, R[2]=1 -> 3+1-1=3 -> correct.\n\n        Actually, the entire increasing segment that contains i is from i - L[i] + 1 to i + R[i] - 1? \n\n        Let me define:\n            left_bound = i - L[i] + 1   (start index of the increasing segment ending at i)\n            Then the entire increasing segment that ends at i is from left_bound to i, and then the increasing segment that starts at i is from i to i+R[i]-1. But note: the entire increasing segment that covers i is from left_bound to i+R[i]-1, and the length is (i - left_bound + 1 + R[i]) = (L[i] + R[i])? \n\n        Actually, the entire increasing segment that contains i is the union of the increasing segment ending at i and the increasing segment starting at i? Not exactly: because the increasing segment ending at i might extend to the left and the increasing segment starting at i extends to the right, but they are contiguous. So the entire segment is from i - L[i] + 1 to i + R[i] - 1, and the length is (i - (i - L[i] + 1) + 1) + ( (i+R[i]-1) - i + 1 )? \n\n        Actually, the entire increasing segment that contains i is of length L[i] (from the left) and then we add the right part? But wait, the increasing segment ending at i is from i - L[i] + 1 to i, and the increasing segment starting at i is from i to i+R[i]-1. But note: the entire segment from i - L[i] + 1 to i+R[i]-1 must be increasing? \n\n        However, we know that the increasing segment ending at i is increasing, and the increasing segment starting at i is increasing, but the entire segment from i - L[i] + 1 to i+R[i]-1 is increasing only if the entire part is increasing. But that is not necessarily true because the condition for increasing is local (each adjacent pair). The entire segment from i - L[i] + 1 to i is increasing, and from i to i+R[i]-1 is increasing, but the transition from i-1 to i is already included in the left part, and from i to i+1 is included in the right part. So the entire segment is increasing.\n\n        Therefore, the entire increasing segment that contains i is from i - L[i] + 1 to i + R[i] - 1, and the length is L[i] + R[i] - 1.\n\n        So without change, the maximum length is max_i (L[i] + R[i] - 1).\n\n        Now, with one change, we can consider:\n\n        Possibility 1: Change an element in the middle of two increasing runs.\n\n        We can consider three cases for the break:\n\n          Case 1: The break is at position i (so we change a[i]). Then we can merge the left run (of length L[i-1]) and the right run (of length R[i+1]) if the condition holds: a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then the length is L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1].\n\n          Case 2: The break is at the left of the changed element: meaning we change an element and the break is caused by the previous element and the changed one. But note, we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily, so we can fix the entire segment. However, the idea is to consider the entire contiguous segment that can be made strictly increasing by changing one element.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to choose any contiguous segment. So we are not forced to take the entire left and right runs. However, the goal is to maximize the length.\n\n        We can consider:\n\n          candidate1 = max_{i} (L[i] + R[i] - 1)   [no change]\n\n          candidate2 = max_{i} { \n              // Changing a[i]: we can merge the left run and the right run if the condition holds, otherwise we can only merge one side (if one side exists) or just the element itself.\n              if i is from 1 to n-2: \n                  if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                      candidate_i = L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1]\n                  else:\n                      candidate_i = max(L[i-1] + 1, 1 + R[i+1])\n              if i==0 (changing the first element): \n                  candidate_0 = 1 + R[1]   [if n>=2, otherwise 1]\n              if i==n-1:\n                  candidate_last = L[n-2] + 1   [if n>=2, otherwise 1]\n          }\n\n        However, note: when we change a[i] and the condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] fails, we can still use the left run (if exists) or the right run (if exists). But wait, if we change a[i] and the left run exists, we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] (since we are free to choose any integer). Similarly, we can set a[i] to be less than a[i+1] (if the right run exists). But note: if both left and right exist and the condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] fails, then we cannot set a[i] to satisfy both. But we can set a[i] to satisfy one and ignore the other? \n\n        Actually, we are forming a contiguous segment. We can choose the segment arbitrarily. So if we change a[i] and we want to use the left run and the right run, we require a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1]. If we don't require to use the entire left run and the entire right run, but we are allowed to choose the segment arbitrarily, then we can choose a segment that does not require both conditions? \n\n        But note: the segment we are considering is contiguous. We are allowed to change one element. The idea is to maximize the length.\n\n        However, the above candidate_i (for i from 1 to n-2) considers the entire left run (from i-L[i-1] to i-1) and the entire right run (from i+1 to i+R[i+1]) and the changed a[i]. But if the condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] fails, we can still form a segment that is the union of the left run (without the right) and the changed a[i] (which is set to be greater than a[i-1]) and then stop at i (so the segment is from i-L[i-1] to i). Or we can form a segment that is the changed a[i] and the right run (set a[i] < a[i+1]).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change one element and then the entire segment must be strictly increasing. Therefore, if we change a[i] and we want to include both the left and the right, we must have a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1]. Otherwise, we cannot have both the left and the right.\n\n        However, we are free to choose the segment. So if we change a[i] and we don't require the entire left run and the entire right run, we can choose a segment that is the left run (if we set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]) and then stop at i (so the segment is from i-L[i-1] to i). Similarly, we can choose a segment that is from i to i+R[i+1]-1 (if we set a[i] to be less than a[i+1]).\n\n        But wait: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. When we change a[i] to a value that is greater than a[i-1] and we stop at i, then the segment from i-L[i-1] to i is strictly increasing. Similarly, if we change a[i] to a value that is less than a[i+1] and we start from i, then the segment from i to i+R[i+1]-1 is strictly increasing.\n\n        However, the above candidate_i for the middle change (without merging) is not considered in the above candidate_i for the entire merged segment. But note: without merging, we already have the possibility of having a segment of length L[i-1]+1 (if we change a[i] and then the segment from the start of the left run to i) and 1+R[i+1] (if we change a[i] and then the segment from i to the end of the right run). But these are already covered by the no-change case? Because without change, we can have a segment of length L[i-1] (from the left run) and then we are adding one element (the changed a[i]) so we get L[i-1]+1, which is the same as if we had an increasing sequence of length L[i-1] and then we add one element arbitrarily (and the condition is satisfied by the change). Similarly, we can have a segment of length R[i+1]+1.\n\n        But note: the no-change case already gives the maximum increasing segment. The change allows us to break the rule and then fix. However, the change can also be used to extend a segment that was broken by one element.\n\n        Actually, the above candidate_i for the middle change (when the condition fails) is:\n\n            candidate_i = max(L[i-1] + 1, 1 + R[i+1])\n\n        But note: we might be able to form a segment that is longer than just the left run plus one or the right run plus one? \n\n        However, we are allowed to change one element. We are not forced to use the entire left run or the entire right run. But we want the maximum. So the best we can do by changing a[i] is:\n\n            If we change a[i] and we want to use the left run, we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] and then the segment from the start of the left run to i is strictly increasing. The length is L[i-1] + 1.\n\n            Similarly, we can set a[i] to be less than a[i+1] and then the segment from i to the end of the right run is strictly increasing. The length is R[i+1] + 1.\n\n        But wait, we can also combine the left run and the right run if the condition holds (a[i-1] < a[i+1]), then the entire segment from the start of the left run to the end of the right run is strictly increasing (by setting a[i] appropriately). Then the length is L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1].\n\n        However, what if the left run and the right run are not the entire runs? Actually, we defined L[i-1] as the length of the increasing segment ending at i-1, and R[i+1] as the length of the increasing segment starting at i+1. So the entire left run is from i-1 - L[i-1] + 1 to i-1, and the entire right run is from i+1 to i+1+R[i+1]-1.\n\n        Therefore, the candidate for changing a[i] is:\n\n            candidate = 1\n            if i-1 >= 0: candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1)\n            if i+1 < n: candidate = max(candidate, R[i+1] + 1)\n            if i-1>=0 and i+1<n and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1])\n\n        Then we take the maximum candidate over all i.\n\n        But note: the no-change case is already considered by the fact that if the segment is already strictly increasing, then we don't need to change. However, the above candidate for the change might also cover the no-change case? Actually, no: because in the no-change case, we don't change. But note: the problem allows at most one change, so we can also consider segments that are already increasing (which is the same as changing zero times). However, the above candidate for the change also considers segments that are broken by one element and then fixed. But the no-change case is the maximum increasing segment without any change.\n\n        However, the above candidate for the change might give a larger segment than the no-change case.\n\n        Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] (n=4)\n\n        Without change: \n            [1,3] -> increasing, [3,2] -> break, [2,4] -> increasing.\n            The maximum increasing segment without change is 2.\n\n        With change: \n            Consider changing the element at index1 (value 3) or index2 (value 2).\n\n            If we change the element at index1 (3):\n                Condition: left part: [1] -> L[0]=1, right part: [2,4] -> R[2]=2 (but wait, our R is defined from the current index: R[2] is the increasing segment starting at index2, which is [2,4] so R[2]=2). Condition: a[0] < a[2] -> 1 < 2 -> true.\n                Then candidate = 1 (from left) + 1 (the changed element) + 2 (right) = 4.\n\n            But wait, the entire segment [1, changed_value, 2,4] must be strictly increasing. We set the changed_value to be between 1 and 2, say 1.5. Then [1,1.5,2,4] is strictly increasing. So the answer should be 4.\n\n            However, the input is [1,3,2,4] and we are allowed to change one element. So the answer is 4.\n\n        But wait, the example in the problem: \n            Input: [7,2,3,1,5,6] -> output 5.\n\n        Let's test with our method for the example:\n\n            a = [7,2,3,1,5,6]\n\n            Compute L (increasing ending at i):\n                L[0]=1\n                L[1]: 2>7? No -> 1\n                L[2]: 3>2 -> yes -> L[1]+1=2\n                L[3]: 1>3? No -> 1\n                L[4]: 5>1 -> yes -> 2\n                L[5]: 6>5 -> yes -> 3\n\n            Compute R (increasing starting at i):\n                R[5]=1\n                R[4]: 5<6 -> yes -> R[5]+1=2\n                R[3]: 1<5 -> yes -> R[4]+1=3\n                R[2]: 3<1 -> no -> 1\n                R[1]: 2<3 -> yes -> R[2]+1=2\n                R[0]: 7<2 -> no -> 1\n\n            Then, without change: max_i (L[i]+R[i]-1) = \n                i0: 1+1-1=1\n                i1: 1+2-1=2\n                i2: 2+1-1=2\n                i3: 1+3-1=3\n                i4: 2+2-1=3\n                i5: 3+1-1=3\n                -> 3\n\n            But wait, the example says we can get 5. So clearly the no-change case is 3, but with change we can get 5.\n\n            Now, consider changing the element at index3 (value 1). Then:\n                Condition: left part: L[2]=2 (so the left run is [2,3] -> index1 and index2) and right part: R[4]=2 (the right run is [5,6] -> index4 and index5). Condition: a[2] < a[4] -> 3 < 5 -> true.\n                candidate = 2 (left) + 1 (change) + 2 (right) = 5.\n\n            So we found a candidate of 5.\n\n            Now, we must consider all indices. We found 5 at index3.\n\n            Also, note: we must consider the boundaries.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and list a.\n\n            Step 2: Precompute L and R.\n\n            Step 3: Initialize ans = max_i (L[i] + R[i] - 1)   [this is the no-change case]\n\n            Step 4: For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                    candidate = 1\n                    if i>=1: candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1)\n                    if i < n-1: candidate = max(candidate, R[i+1] + 1)\n                    if i>=1 and i<n-1 and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                        candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1])\n\n                    ans = max(ans, candidate)\n\n            But wait, what about the case where we change an element and the segment we form is entirely contained in the left run (without the change) and then we change the last element of the left run? Actually, no: because the left run is defined as ending at i-1, and then we change a[i] (the next element) and then we can extend the left run by one (if we set a[i] > a[i-1]). But note: we are iterating by the index of the change.\n\n            However, we must also consider the possibility that the segment we form by changing a[i] might be a segment that is entirely contained in the left run and the changed element (without the right run). But that is already covered by candidate = L[i-1] + 1.\n\n            But wait, the entire left run is from i-L[i-1] to i-1. Then we change a[i] (which is at index i) and then we form a segment from i-L[i-1] to i. The length is L[i-1] + 1.\n\n            However, what if we change an element that is in the middle of the left run? Then the left run is broken. Actually, we are only considering the change at index i, and the left run we use is the one ending at i-1 (so the element at i-1 is the last of the left run). So the change at i is after the left run.\n\n            Similarly, the change at i is before the right run.\n\n            But what about changing an element that is in the middle of a run? Then we break the run. But note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily, so we can fix a broken segment. However, we are not required to use the entire run.\n\n            Actually, the above candidate considers the change at i and then uses the entire left run (if we set a[i] > a[i-1]) and then we can extend the segment to the left until the beginning of the left run. But the left run is defined without considering the change. So the left run is the maximal increasing segment ending at i-1.\n\n            This approach seems to work.\n\n            However, note: the segment that we form by changing a[i] and then using the left run and the right run (if condition holds) must be strictly increasing. But note: the left run and the right run are already increasing. The condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] ensures that we can choose a[i] to be between them. Then the entire segment is increasing.\n\n            But wait: what if the left run and the right run are long, but the condition fails? Then we cannot merge, so we take the maximum of the two separate possibilities.\n\n            One more example: [1,5,3,2,4] \n\n            Without change: \n                [1,5] -> break, [5,3] -> break, [3,2] -> break, [2,4] -> increasing.\n                Maximum without change: 2.\n\n            With change: \n                Consider changing index1 (5): \n                    Condition: a[0] < a[2] -> 1 < 3 -> true.\n                    candidate = L[0] + 1 + R[2] = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. \n                    Check: [1, x, 3,2,4] -> we set x to between 1 and 3, say 2. Then the segment [1,2,3] is increasing. But wait, the entire segment from index0 to index2 is [1,2,3] (if we change the 5 to 2) but then the rest: 3,2,4 is not increasing. However, we are allowed to choose the contiguous segment arbitrarily. So we can choose the segment from index0 to index2 (length 3) or from index0 to index4? \n\n                    Actually, the segment we are considering by the above candidate is from index0 to index4? \n\n                    But note: our L[0]=1, R[2]=2 (the increasing segment starting at index2 is [3,2] -> wait, no: [3,2] is not increasing! \n\n                    Let me recalc R for [1,5,3,2,4]:\n                        a = [1,5,3,2,4]\n                        R[4]=1\n                        R[3]: 2<4 -> yes -> R[4]+1=2\n                        R[2]: 3<2 -> no -> 1\n                        R[1]: 5<3 -> no -> 1\n                        R[0]: 1<5 -> yes -> R[1]+1=2   -> but wait, the increasing segment starting at 0: [1,5] is not increasing (strictly) because 1<5 -> actually, strictly increasing requires",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one element to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to determine the maximum possible length of such a subsegment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by altering at most one element. The key insight is that any valid subsegment must either be already strictly increasing or can be formed by merging two strictly increasing subsegments with a single change in between.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Precompute Arrays**: We first compute two arrays, `L` and `R`, where:\n     - `L[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n     - `R[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n   - **Initial Maximum**: The initial maximum length without any changes is the maximum value of `L[i] + R[i] - 1` for all `i`.\n   - **Handling Changes**: For each element in the array, consider changing it and check if merging adjacent increasing subsegments is feasible. The feasibility is determined by ensuring the elements before and after the changed position can form a strictly increasing sequence when the middle element is adjusted appropriately.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Linear Pass**: Compute the `L` and `R` arrays in a single pass from left to right and right to left, respectively.\n   - **Maximization**: For each element, calculate potential segment lengths by considering changes at that element, then update the maximum length accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the sequence, as it involves three linear passes (two for computing `L` and `R`, and one for determining the maximum segment length). The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the `L` and `R` arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    elif n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    L = [1] * n\n    R = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            L[i] = L[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            R[i] = R[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(L[i] + R[i] - 1 for i in range(n))\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        candidate = 1\n        if i >= 1:\n            candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1)\n        if i < n-1:\n            candidate = max(candidate, R[i+1] + 1)\n        if i >= 1 and i < n-1 and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            candidate = max(candidate, L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1])\n        if candidate > ans:\n            ans = candidate\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Edge Cases**: Directly handle cases where the sequence length is 0 or 1.\n3. **Computing Arrays**:\n   - **L Array**: For each element from left to right, `L[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at `i`.\n   - **R Array**: For each element from right to left, `R[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at `i`.\n4. **Initial Maximum Calculation**: The initial answer is the maximum value of `L[i] + R[i] - 1` across all elements, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Handling Changes**: For each element, consider changing it and compute potential segment lengths by merging adjacent increasing subsegments if feasible. The feasibility is checked by ensuring the elements before and after the changed position allow a strictly increasing sequence when the middle element is adjusted.\n6. **Output**: The maximum segment length found during the process is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one change, ensuring optimal performance even for large sequences.",
