Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, we can recycle: every time we have 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle.\n\n How it works:\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We burn them all (each hour one) so we get 'a' hours and then we have 'a' old candles.\n   Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from the old ones, and the leftover old candles (a % b) remain.\n\n However, note that the process continues until we don't have enough old candles to make a new one.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 2\" gives 7 hours.\n\n Steps for [4,2]:\n   Start with 4 new candles -> burn 4 hours, now we have 4 old candles.\n   From 4 old candles, we can make 4 // 2 = 2 new candles, and we have 0 left.\n   Then we burn these 2 new candles for 2 hours, and get 2 old candles.\n   Now, from 2 old candles, we can make 2 // 2 = 1 new candle, and 0 left.\n   Then burn that 1 candle for 1 hour, and get 1 old candle -> but we cannot make a new candle (since 1 < 2).\n   Total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   Let hours = 0\n   Let current_new = a   (initially we have a new candles)\n   Let current_old = 0\n\n   But actually, we can think in terms of cycles:\n\n   We can break the process into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: We use all the initial candles and the ones we make from recycling until we run out.\n\n   However, note that the problem is small (a, b between 1 and 1000) so simulation is acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a   # this is the number of new candles we have at the beginning of a cycle (or the ones we just made)\n   old_candles = 0\n\n   But wait: we burn one candle per hour. So we can also model:\n\n   while current_candles > 0:\n        Use all current_candles: burn them, which gives current_candles hours and then we have current_candles old candles.\n        Then, we can convert the old_candles (which is current_candles) to new candles: new_candles = old_candles // b\n        Then set current_candles = new_candles, and we have leftover_old = old_candles % b.\n\n   However, note: after burning, the old candles are the ones we just burned. Then we use them to make new ones.\n\n   But wait, the above simulation doesn't account for the fact that we can use leftover old candles from previous steps.\n\n   Actually, we need to keep track of both the new candles and the old candles separately? Or we can do:\n\n   total = a\n   leftover = 0\n   while total >= b:\n        # Burn all the 'total' new candles: that gives total hours.\n        # Then, we get total old candles (from burning)\n        # Then, we can make total // b new candles, and we have leftover = total % b\n        # Then, we add the new candles to the leftover? Actually, we can consider: \n        # After burning, we have total old candles. Then we use b to make one new candle, so we can make n = total // b, and then we have r = total % b old candles left.\n        # Then, we set total = n + r   [because the new candles we made are n, and the leftover old candles are r]\n        # But wait, in the example: \n        #   Start: total = 4, leftover = 0\n        #   Burn 4: hours += 4 -> 4, then we have 4 old candles.\n        #   Then, n = 4 // 2 = 2, r = 0, so total becomes 2 (which is 2 new candles). Then we burn these 2: hours += 2 -> 6, then we have 2 old candles.\n        #   Then, n = 2 // 2 = 1, r=0, total becomes 1 -> burn 1: hours += 1 -> 7, then we have 1 old candle -> which is less than 2, so stop.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Another way: we know that initially we have 'a' candles. We burn them and get 'a' old ones, then we make floor(a/b) new ones and have a % b leftover.\n   Then we can consider the next cycle: we have floor(a/b) + (a % b) candles (because we can use the leftover from the old ones along with the new ones).\n\n   So we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current >= b:\n        hours += current   # because we burn all current candles, each gives one hour\n        current = current // b + current % b   # because we get current//b new candles and current % b leftover old candles\n\n   But wait, in the first step: \n        a=4, b=2: \n        hours = 4\n        current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2 + 0 = 2\n        Then, next iteration: 2>=2 -> yes\n        hours = 4+2 = 6\n        current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n        Then, 1<2 -> stop. But we got 6, but expected is 7.\n\n   Why 7? Because after the second cycle, we burned 2 candles (so 2 more hours) and then we had 2 old candles which were used to make 1 new candle, and then we burn that 1 new candle (1 hour) in the next cycle.\n\n   However, note that the above simulation only burns the candles in the current cycle and then recycles. But the last candle (the one we made from 2) is burned in the same cycle? \n\n   Actually, the process is:\n\n   - First, we have 4 new candles: burn them (4 hours), then we have 4 old ones -> which gives 2 new ones (and 0 leftover). Then we have 2 new ones to burn.\n\n   So the total hours should be 4 (first burn) + 2 (second burn) + 1 (third burn) = 7.\n\n   In the above code, we did:\n\n        Step1: hours=4, then current=2.\n        Step2: hours=4+2=6, then current=1.\n        Step3: then we break.\n\n   But we haven't counted the last hour from the last candle (the one we made from 2 old ones). However, note that when we set current=1, that 1 candle hasn't been burned yet.\n\n   So we need to continue until current is less than b, but we must burn the remaining current candles as well.\n\n   However, if we break when current < b, then we haven't burned those current candles. Therefore, we should burn all the current candles at the beginning of the loop, but then the condition for the next cycle is to use the leftovers to make more.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break the process differently:\n\n   We can count the total hours by:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new = a\n   current_old = 0\n\n   But note: we can also think:\n\n   We will have cycles. In each cycle, we burn all the new candles we have, then we use the old ones to make new ones.\n\n   However, the problem is that the last cycle (when we have less than b) we still burn the candles we have.\n\n   Revised simulation:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   new = a\n   old = 0\n\n   while new > 0:\n        # Burn all new candles\n        total_hours += new\n        # Now, these new candles become old candles\n        old += new\n        new = 0   # because we used all new candles\n\n        # Now, we can convert old candles to new ones\n        if old >= b:\n            new = old // b\n            old = old % b\n        else:\n            # We break the loop because we cannot make any new candle, and the old candles are not enough to form even one\n            # But note: we might have old candles left, but we cannot form a new candle. And we don't burn the old candles again? \n            # According to the problem, we only use old candles to make new ones, and we don't burn old candles directly.\n            # So we break.\n            break\n\n   But wait, in the example:\n\n        Start: new=4, old=0\n        Loop1: \n            total_hours += 4 -> 4\n            old becomes 4\n            new = 0\n            Since old>=2 (b=2): new = 4//2 = 2, old = 0\n        Loop2:\n            total_hours += 2 -> 6\n            old becomes 2\n            new=0\n            Then new = 2//2 = 1, old = 0\n        Loop3:\n            total_hours += 1 -> 7\n            old becomes 1\n            new=0\n            Then since 1<2, break.\n\n   This gives 7.\n\n   But what about the leftover old candles from the previous step? In the above, after burning we set new=0 and then we use the old candles to make new ones, then we reset old to the remainder. Then we set new to the quotient, and then we use the new ones in the next cycle.\n\n   However, note: the above simulation does not account for the fact that we might have leftover old candles from previous cycles that we didn't use. But in the example, we did: after the first cycle, we used all old candles (4) to make 2 new ones and 0 leftover. Then in the second cycle, we burned the 2 new ones, then we have 2 old ones, then we use them to make 1 new and 0 leftover. Then in the third cycle, we burn the 1 new one and then we have 1 old one (which is not used because 1<2).\n\n   But what if we have leftover old candles from previous cycles? For example, let a=5, b=3.\n\n        Start: new=5, old=0\n        Cycle1: \n            total_hours=5\n            old=5\n            new = 5//3 = 1, old=5%3=2\n        Cycle2:\n            total_hours=5+1=6\n            old=1 (current new=1 becomes old) + 2 (leftover from previous) = 3\n            new = 3//3 = 1, old=0\n        Cycle3:\n            total_hours=6+1=7\n            old=1\n            Then break.\n\n        Expected: 5 (first burn) + 1 (from the first recycling) + 1 (from the second recycling) = 7.\n\n        But wait, how many hours? \n          - First burn: 5 candles (5 hours)\n          - Then, from 5 old, we make 1 new and have 2 leftover. Then we burn that 1 new (1 hour) -> total 6.\n          - Then, we have 1 old (from the last burned candle) and 2 leftover from before -> total 3 old, which makes 1 new and 0 leftover. Then we burn that 1 new (1 hour) -> total 7.\n\n        So the simulation above is correct.\n\n   However, note that in the second cycle, when we start with new=1 (from the first recycling) and old=2 (from the first recycling), we combine them: we burn the 1 new candle and then we have 1 (from that candle) + 2 (from leftover) = 3 old candles.\n\n   But wait, in our simulation above, we did:\n\n        In the first cycle, after burning the 5 new candles, we set old=5, then we do new = 5//3=1, old=5%3=2.\n\n        Then in the second cycle, we start with new=1 (which is the recycled one) and old=2 (from the previous step). Then we burn the new=1, so we add 1 to total_hours (making 6) and then set old = 1 (from the burned one) + 2 (from the previous old) = 3. Then we make new=3//3=1, and old=0.\n\n        Then in the third cycle, we burn the new=1 (adding 1 hour, making 7) and then set old=1, and then we break.\n\n   But note: in the second cycle, we are using the old=2 from the previous step, but in the code above, we did not explicitly carry over the old from the previous step? \n\n   Actually, in the code above, we did:\n\n        We started with new=5, old=0.\n        Then we burned the new, then set old = 5 (from the burned new) and then computed new = 5//3=1 and old=5%3=2.\n\n        Then we enter the next cycle: we have new=1, old=2? But wait, in the code above, we did not set old=2 at the end of the first cycle. We only set old=2 at the end of the first cycle, but then we reset new=1 and old=2.\n\n   However, look at the code structure:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        new = a\n        old = 0\n\n        while new > 0:\n            total_hours += new\n            old += new   # This line adds the current new candles to old\n            new = 0     # because we used them all\n\n            if old >= b:\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But wait, in the first cycle for a=5, b=3:\n\n            new = 5, old=0\n            total_hours +=5 -> 5\n            old +=5 -> old=5\n            new=0\n\n            Then, since old>=3, new = 5//3 = 1, old=5%3=2.\n\n        Then the next cycle:\n\n            new=1, old=2 (but note: we did not change old to 2? Actually, we did: old was 5, then we set old=5%3=2. So the old variable is 2.\n\n        Then the next iteration:\n\n            total_hours +=1 -> 6\n            old +=1 -> old=3\n            new=0\n\n            Then, since old>=3, new=3//3=1, old=0.\n\n        Then the next iteration:\n\n            total_hours +=1 -> 7\n            old +=1 -> old=1\n            new=0\n\n            Then, old=1 <3 -> break.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note that the above code does:\n\n        In the first cycle: we set old=5 (from the 5 new candles) and then we set old=2 (from 5%3). So the old variable is updated.\n\n   But wait, we are adding the current new candles to old at the beginning of the cycle? Actually, we do:\n\n        Step1: burn the new candles -> add their burning time (new) to total_hours.\n        Step2: then we add the entire new candles to old (so old becomes old + new).\n        Then we set new to 0.\n\n        Then we use old to make new ones.\n\n   This is correct because the burned candles become old.\n\n   But note: in the next cycle, we start with the new candles we made (from the old ones) and then we have the leftover old candles (from the previous old % b). Then we burn the new ones (which we just made) and add those to the old (so the old from the previous cycle's leftover and the new burned ones).\n\n   However, there is a problem: the leftover old candles from the previous cycle are stored in the variable 'old', and then we burn the new ones (from the current cycle) and add them to old. Then we use the entire old (which includes the leftover from previous and the current burned ones) to make new ones.\n\n   This is the correct process.\n\n   But wait, what if we have multiple cycles? The code above uses the variable 'old' to accumulate the leftovers from the burned candles and the leftovers from the recycling.\n\n   Let's test with the provided example: ['6 3'] -> expected 8.\n\n        Input: a=6, b=3\n\n        Start: new=6, old=0\n        Cycle1:\n            total_hours = 6\n            old = 6\n            new = 0\n            old>=3 -> new = 6//3=2, old=6%3=0\n        Cycle2:\n            total_hours = 6+2=8\n            old = 0+2=2\n            new=0\n            old=2 <3 -> break.\n\n        So we get 8. Correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example input ['6 3'] is given as output 8.\n\n   But note: the example input was given as two examples: \n        Input: ['4 2', '6 3']\n        Output: ['7', '8']\n\n   So the code above produces 8 for (6,3). \n\n   But let me check the process for (6,3):\n\n        We have 6 new candles -> burn 6 hours, then we have 6 old candles -> which can be made into 6//3=2 new candles (and 0 leftover).\n        Then we burn these 2 new candles -> 2 hours, so total 8 hours.\n\n        Then we have 2 old candles (from the 2 burned ones) -> which is not enough (2<3) so we stop.\n\n   Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says we have two integers on the same line.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data: \n            # but the problem says two integers, so we assume there are two.\n            pass\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n   Then run the simulation.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints (a and b between 1 and 1000) so the while loop will run at most around log_b(a) times, which is safe.\n\n   However, we can optimize the code by not having to reset new to 0 and then set new from old, but the above simulation is clear.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a mathematical approach:\n\n        total = a\n        hours = a\n        while total >= b:\n            total = total // b + total % b\n            hours += total   # but wait, this is not the same as above.\n\n        But wait, the above simulation did:\n\n            hours = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n            while new>0:\n                hours += new\n                old += new\n                new = 0\n                if old >= b:\n                    new = old // b\n                    old = old % b\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        We can rewrite without the old variable by merging the two:\n\n            Let x = a\n            Then the process is: \n                hours += x\n                Then we get x old candles, so we can form x//b new ones and leave x % b old.\n                Then we set x = x//b + x % b   [because the new ones we made and the leftover old candles are available for the next cycle]\n\n            However, wait: in the example (4,2):\n                Start: x=4 -> hours=4, then x = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0=2 -> then hours=4+2=6, then x=2//2+2%2=1+0=1 -> then hours=6+1=7, then x=1 -> stop.\n\n            But note: we are adding the entire x in each cycle. This is exactly the same as the simulation above.\n\n            However, in the simulation above, we did:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                new = a\n                old = 0\n\n                while new > 0:\n                    total_hours += new\n                    old += new\n                    new = old // b\n                    old = old % b   [if old>=b, but actually we can do this without checking because if old < b then new=0 and we break]\n\n            But wait, if we do:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                x = a\n                while x >= b or x > 0:   # Actually, we burn even if x < b? No, we burn until we cannot form a new candle. But note: we can still burn the remaining x even if x < b.\n\n            Actually, the condition in the simulation above was while new>0. But if we use the merged version, we must burn all the candles we have (even if less than b) and then try to recycle.\n\n            However, the process is:\n\n                We burn the candles we have (x) and then we get x old candles, then we make new ones from x old candles.\n\n            So the steps:\n\n                hours += x   (burning)\n                Then, we can form n = x // b, and we have r = x % b.\n                Then the next x becomes n + r? But wait, no: the old candles are x (which is the number of candles we just burned) and then we use them to make n and leave r. Then the next cycle we have n (which are new candles) and we have r old candles (which are not burned yet). But in the next cycle, we will burn the n new candles and then we have n (from burning) + r (from leftover) = n+r.\n\n            However, in the simulation above, we did:\n\n                total_hours += new   [which is the current x]\n                Then, we set new = (old // b)   [but old was the old candles from previous cycle?] \n\n            Actually, we need to restructure: \n\n            Let x = a\n            Let leftover = 0\n\n            But the two-step process:\n\n            Option 1 (using two variables) is clear.\n\n            Option 2 (without two variables) is:\n\n                hours = 0\n                candles = a\n                while candles >= b:\n                    # Burn all candles: add candles to hours\n                    hours += candles\n                    # Now, we get candles old, so we can make new_candles = candles // b, and leftover = candles % b\n                    # Then, the next candles is new_candles + leftover\n                    candles = candles // b + candles % b\n                # Now, what if we break the loop because candles < b?\n                # Then, we still have 'candles' candles (which are new) that we haven't burned? \n                # Actually, no: the condition is while candles>=b. When we break, we have candles < b, but we haven't burned the last 'candles' candles.\n\n                Then we must add the last candles? \n\n                Example (4,2): \n                    Step1: candles=4 -> hours=4, candles=4//2+4%2=2+0=2\n                    Step2: candles=2 -> hours=4+2=6, candles=2//2+2%2=1+0=1\n                    Then break, and we have 1 candle left (unburned). But according to the problem, we burn it.\n\n                So we must burn the remaining candles (even if less than b) because they are new and we can use them.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                hours = 0\n                candles = a\n                while candles >= b or candles > 0:\n                    # But wait, if we break the condition, we still have candles>0 and <b, then we burn them.\n\n                Actually, we can separate:\n\n                hours = 0\n                while a > 0:\n                    # Burn all the current candles (a)\n                    hours += a\n                    # Now, we get a old candles, which we can convert to new ones: a // b, and leftover a % b.\n                    # But wait, we are using the variable 'a'. Let's use a different variable.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                hours = 0\n                current = a\n                while current >= b:\n                    hours += current\n                    current = current // b + current % b\n                hours += current   # because we break the loop when current < b, but we still have current candles (which we can burn)\n\n                Example (4,2):\n                    Step1: current=4>=2 -> hours=4, current=2+0=2\n                    Step2: current=2>=2 -> hours=4+2=6, current=1+0=1\n                    Then, current=1<2 -> break, then add current (1) -> hours=7.\n\n                Example (6,3):\n                    Step1: current=6>=3 -> hours=6, current=2+0=2\n                    Step2: current=2<3 -> break, then add 2 -> hours=8.\n\n                Example (5,3):\n                    Step1: current=5>=3 -> hours=5, current=5//3=1+5%3=2 -> current=1+2=3? Wait, no: \n                        5//3=1, 5%3=2 -> current=1+2=3.\n                    Then, 3>=3 -> hours=5+3=8, current=3//3=1+0=1.\n                    Then, 1<3 -> break, then add 1 -> hours=9.\n\n                But wait, let's check (5,3) manually:\n\n                    Start: 5 candles -> burn 5, then we have 5 old -> make 1 new (5//3=1) and 2 leftover.\n                    Then we have 1 new (which is the recycled one) and 2 leftover (old) -> so total available for next cycle: 1 (recycled) + 2 (leftover) = 3.\n                    Then we burn the 3? Actually, we don't have 3 as new candles initially, but we have 3 candles (the recycled one is new, and the 2 leftover are old). But the problem says: we can only use the old candles to make new ones. Once we have burned the recycled one, then we have 1 old candle (from the recycled one) and the 2 leftover from before -> total 3 old candles.\n\n                    Then, we can make 3//3=1 new candle from the 3 old ones. Then we burn that 1 new candle (which gives 1 hour) and then we have 1 old candle.\n\n                    Then, we cannot make a new candle from 1 old candle.\n\n                    Total hours: 5 (first) + 3 (second: we burned the 1 new and then we burned the 3 old candles? But wait, no: the 3 old candles are not burned directly. The process is:\n\n                    Step1: burn the 5 -> 5 hours, then we have 5 old -> make 1 new and 2 leftover (old).\n                    Step2: burn the 1 new -> 1 hour (total 6), then we have 1 old (from the burned new) and 2 old (from previous) -> total 3 old.\n                    Then, from the 3 old, we make 1 new -> so we burn that 1 new in the next cycle: 1 hour (total 7) and then we have 1 old.\n\n                    But wait, in our code above we did:\n\n                        Step1: current=5 -> hours=5, current=5//3+5%3=1+2=3\n                        Step2: current=3>=3 -> hours=5+3=8, current=3//3+3%3=1+0=1\n                        Then add 1 -> total 9.\n\n                    This is not matching.\n\n                What went wrong?\n\n                In the code above, we are using:\n\n                    current = current // b + current % b\n\n                But note: in the first step, we burned 5 candles and then we have 5 old candles. Then we make 5//3=1 new candle and leave 5%3=2 old candles. Then the next cycle we have 1 new candle and 2 old candles. But in the code, we set current to 1+2=3, meaning we are treating the leftover old candles as if they were new candles? \n\n                However, the problem says: we can only use old candles to make new ones. And once we make a new candle, we can burn it (and then it becomes old). But the leftover old candles are not burned until they are part of the old set from burning.\n\n                In the code, the variable 'current' is the number of new candles we have at the beginning of the cycle. After burning, we get that many old candles, which we then use to make new ones. But the leftover old candles from previous cycles are not included in the 'current' variable.\n\n                In the example (5,3):\n\n                    We start with current=5 (new candles). Then we burn them (5 hours) and then we have 5 old candles. Then we make 1 new and leave 2 old. Then the next cycle we have 1 new candle (current=1) and 2 old candles (which we are not including in current). Then we burn the 1 new candle (1 hour) and then we have 1 old (from the burned one) plus the 2 old from before -> 3 old. Then we make 1 new and 0 leftover.\n\n                But in the code above, we did:\n\n                    Step1: current=5 -> hours=5, then current=5//3+5%3=1+2=3.\n\n                This 3 is the new candles we made (1) plus the leftover old candles (2). But the leftover old candles are not new candles. They are old candles. We cannot burn them until they are turned into new candles (by recycling) or by being part of the burned set? \n\n                Actually, the process is:\n\n                    We have two types: new and old. But we can only use old to make new. The new ones we burn and they become old.\n\n                In the code above (with two variables) we accounted for the old candles separately. \n\n                The problem is that in the two-step method (without two variables) we are combining the leftover old candles (which are not new) with the new candles we are going to burn. But we cannot burn old candles; we can only burn new ones.\n\n                Therefore, the two-step method is necessary.\n\n   After reevaluating, I think the two-variable simulation is clearer and correct.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        new = a\n        old = 0\n\n        while new > 0:\n            total_hours += new\n            old += new\n            new = old // b\n            old = old % b\n            # But wait, this is incorrect because we are not accounting for the fact that the old candles from previous cycles might be carried over.\n\n        Actually, the above two-variable simulation is:\n\n            while new>0:\n                total_hours += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n        Let's test (5,3):\n\n            Start: new=5, old=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=5\n                old=5\n                new=5//3=1, old=5%3=2\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=5+1=6\n                old=2+1=3\n                new=3//3=1, old=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=6+1=7\n                old=0+1=1\n                new=1//3=0, old=1%3=1 -> but wait, we set new=0, so we break.\n\n            This gives 7, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, why did we get 7? \n\n            We burned 5 (first) -> 5 hours, then we burned 1 (second) -> 6 hours, then we burned 1 (third) -> 7 hours.\n\n        How did the second and third happen?\n\n            After burning the 5, we have 5 old -> make 1 new and 2 leftover. Then we burn the 1 new (which gives 1 hour) and then we have 1 old (from the burned new) and the 2 leftover from before -> total 3 old. Then we use the 3 old to make 1 new (and 0 leftover). Then we burn that 1 new (1 hour) and then we have 1 old (from that burned new) and no leftover from the previous operation (because we set old=0 from 3%3). Then we try to make new from 1 old -> 0, so we break.\n\n        But note: in the second iteration, we set old = 5%3=2, then we add the new burned ones (which is 1) to old: so old becomes 2+1=3. Then we compute new=3//3=1, old=0.\n\n        Then in the third iteration, we set old = 0 + 1 (the new ones we burned) = 1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note that the two-variable simulation above does:\n\n            old += new   [at the beginning of the loop] and then sets new = old // b and old = old % b.\n\n        But wait, the old from the previous step is already stored, and then we add the current new (which we just burned) to old. Then we use the entire old (which includes the previous old and the new burned ones) to make new ones.\n\n        This is correct because the burned candles become old and are available for recycling.\n\n        But note: the two-variable simulation is:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total_hours += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n        But wait, the line \"new = old // b\" and \"old = old % b\" uses the total old (which is the previous old plus the new we just burned). \n\n        However, this is exactly the process: we burn the new ones, so they become old, and then we use all the old (which now includes the previous old and the new burned ones) to make new ones.\n\n        But note: in the first iteration, we start with new=a, old=0. Then we burn a, so we add a to old. Then we use old (which is a) to make new ones.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let's test (4,2):\n\n            new=4, old=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=4\n                old=4\n                new=4//2=2, old=4%2=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=4+2=6\n                old=0+2=2\n                new=2//2=1, old=2%2=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=6+1=7\n                old=0+1=1\n                new=1//2=0, old=1%2=1 -> then break.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        And (6,3):\n\n            new=6, old=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=6\n                old=6\n                new=6//3=2, old=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=6+2=8\n                old=0+2=2\n                new=2//3=0, old=2%3=2 -> break.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But wait, in (6,3) we break in the second iteration because new becomes 0. Then we don't burn the leftover old candles (2). But according to the problem, we can use the old candles to make new ones, but we don't burn the old candles. The old candles are only used to make new ones. And we did use the 2 old candles to try to make new ones (0) and then we break.\n\n        However, note that in the second iteration, we set new=0 and then we break. But we did burn the 2 new candles (in the second iteration) and then we set old=2 (from the burned 2) and then we set new=0 and old=2. Then we break. But we haven't accounted for the possibility of making new candles from the 2 old ones? \n\n        Actually, the process is:\n\n            We burn the new candles (we have 2 in the second iteration) and then we have 2 old candles. Then we use the 2 old candles to make new ones: 2//3=0, so no new candles. Then we break.\n\n        The simulation does not require burning the old candles. We only burn new candles.\n\n        But note: the two-variable simulation burns the new candles (the ones we have at the beginning of the loop) and then uses the total old (which includes the burned ones and the leftovers from previous) to make new ones.\n\n        This is correct",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour, and after burning, it becomes an old candle. These old candles can be combined to form new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough old candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of new candles (`a`) and zero old candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available new candles. Each burned candle contributes one hour to the total and converts into an old candle.\n3. **Recycling Old Candles**: After burning, use the accumulated old candles to create new candles. The number of new candles is determined by dividing the total old candles by `b` (the number of old candles needed to form one new candle). The remainder from this division represents leftover old candles that cannot be converted into a new candle.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles to burn. Once no new candles can be formed (i.e., the number of old candles is less than `b`), the loop terminates.\n5. **Summing Hours**: The total hours are the sum of all candles burned during each iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    new = a\n    old = 0\n    \n    while new > 0:\n        total_hours += new\n        old += new\n        new = old // b\n        old = old % b\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variables `total_hours`, `new`, and `old` are initialized to zero, the given number of new candles (`a`), and zero old candles, respectively.\n- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles (`new > 0`). In each iteration:\n  - **Burning Candles**: The current `new` candles are burned, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n  - **Updating Old Candles**: The burnt candles are added to the `old` count.\n  - **Recycling**: The `old` candles are converted into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of `old` by `b`, and the remainder is the leftover old candles.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when no new candles can be formed (i.e., `new` becomes zero), and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the illumination time.",
