He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, and that they are prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n Approach:\n Since the problem says that there is at least one string consistent with the given set, we can do the following:\n\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the next 2n-2 lines (each containing a string).\n 3. We know that for each length L from 1 to n-1, there are two strings (one prefix and one suffix). However, note that the input might have duplicate strings? But the example: \n        Input: 3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n    Here, two 'a' and two 'aa'. \n\n 4. The idea: For each string, note its length. Then, consider that the entire string of length n must be built by matching the prefix and suffix of the same length.\n\n However, note: The problem does not require us to reconstruct the string, only to assign a label 'P' or 'S' to each of the 2n-2 input strings such that:\n   - The number of 'P' and 'S' are equal (each n-1).\n   - There exists at least one string s of length n that has as its prefixes and suffixes exactly the given multiset of strings (with the correct labels).\n\n Important observation: The problem guarantees that the given set of strings are the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the entire string s has length n, then:\n   - The set of prefixes includes: s[0:1], s[0:2], ... , s[0:n-1]\n   - The set of suffixes includes: s[1:n], s[2:n], ... , s[n-1:n] (i.e., starting at index i for i from 1 to n-1)\n\n How about considering the condition for consistency?\n\n Let the two strings of length 1 be A and B. Then the full string s must start with A and end with B (if A is labeled as prefix and B as suffix) OR start with B and end with A (if B is labeled as prefix and A as suffix). But note: we don't know which is which.\n\n However, we cannot independently assign because the entire string must be consistent.\n\n Observation: Consider the string of length n-1. There are two strings of length n-1: let them be X and Y.\n\n Conditions for the full string s of length n:\n   - s[0:n-1] must be one of them (say X) and s[1:n] must be the other (say Y). But note: if s = \"abc\", then the two length-2 prefixes and suffixes are \"ab\" and \"bc\". \n\n Actually, for the full string s, we have:\n   - The prefix of length n-1: s[0:n-1]\n   - The suffix of length n-1: s[1:n]\n\n And note that s[1:n] is the prefix of length n-1 of s without the first character. But also, the full string s must satisfy:\n   s[0:n-1] + s[n-1] = s   => and then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n] which is s[0:n-1][1:] + s[n-1] ?\n\n Actually, the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters: s[1:n]. And the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1]. \n\n Now, how do these two relate? The full string is s[0] + s[1:n]. Also, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] = s[0] + s[1:n-1]. Then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n] = s[1:n-1] + s[n-1].\n\n Therefore, if we denote:\n   Let P_{n-1} = prefix of length n-1 = s[0:n-1] = [c0, c1, ..., c_{n-2}]\n   Let S_{n-1} = suffix of length n-1 = s[1:n] = [c1, c2, ..., c_{n-1}]\n\n Then, we must have:\n   c0 is the first character of P_{n-1} and the second character of S_{n-1} doesn't exist in this relation? Actually, we can write:\n   P_{n-1} = c0 + s[1:n-1]   (which is the first n-1 characters)\n   S_{n-1} = s[1:n] = s[1:n-1] + c_{",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings to find a consistent assignment of labels ('P' for prefix and 'S' for suffix) such that there exists at least one string `s` of length `n` that matches all the labeled prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem provides `2n-2` strings, exactly two of each length from 1 to `n-1`. These strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the unknown string `s` of length `n`. The challenge is to correctly label each string as either a prefix or a suffix.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution leverages the fact that the first character of the prefix of length `n-1` must match the second character of the suffix of length `n-1`. This relationship helps in distinguishing between the correct prefix and suffix strings.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read all input strings and group them by their lengths.\n   - For each length from `n-1` down to 1, compare the two strings of that length to find the correct pair (prefix and suffix) based on the character matching condition mentioned above.\n   - Once the correct pair is identified, label the other string (which does not satisfy the condition) as the opposite label ('S' if the first was 'P' and vice versa).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n * m), where `n` is the length of the unknown string and `m` is the total number of input strings. This is optimal given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n\n    grouped = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in grouped:\n            grouped[l] = []\n        grouped[l].append(s)\n\n    ans_list = []\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        lst = grouped[l]\n        if len(lst) != 2:\n            continue\n        a, b = lst[0], lst[1]\n        if a[0] == b[-1]:\n            ans_list.append('P')\n            ans_list.append('S')\n        else:\n            ans_list.append('S')\n            ans_list.append('P')\n\n    result_str = ''.join(ans_list)\n    print(result_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` (length of the unknown string) followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: The strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where each key is a length from 1 to `n-1`, and the value is a list of two strings of that length.\n3. **Label Assignment**: Starting from the largest length (`n-1`) down to 1, the code checks each pair of strings. The first string in the pair is labeled 'P' (prefix) if its first character matches the last character of the second string; otherwise, it is labeled 'S' (suffix). The opposite label is assigned to the other string.\n4. **Output**: The labels are concatenated into a single string and printed, which represents the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the correct labels by leveraging the inherent relationship between the prefixes and suffixes of the unknown string, ensuring correctness and optimality.",
