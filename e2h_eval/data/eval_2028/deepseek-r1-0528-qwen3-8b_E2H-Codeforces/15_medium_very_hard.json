They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n (each char is either '0' or '1')\n There are 2^n teams with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n\n The tournament proceeds in phases. In phase i (0-indexed from the first phase as phase0) we have 2^(n-i-1) games? Actually, note:\n   - The first phase: 2^(n-1) games (so phase0 has 2^(n-1) games)\n   - Then, if not done, the next phase (phase1) has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n But note: the problem says \"if only one team remains, it is declared champion; otherwise, the second phase begins\". So there are n phases, each reducing the number of teams by half until the final champion.\n\n The string s has n characters. The i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the i-th phase (the phase that reduces the teams from 2^(n-i) to 2^(n-i-1)). \n\n In the i-th phase (i=0 to n-1), the result is given by s[i]:\n   - If s[i] == '0', then the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s[i] == '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to find all integers x (which are the team numbers, i.e., from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which assigns the skills 1 to 2^n to the teams) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n How to think?\n The tournament structure is fixed: it's a single elimination bracket. The matches in the first phase are fixed: \n   Match 0: team0 vs team1 -> winner goes to next round (and will be placed in the bracket accordingly)\n   Match 1: team2 vs team3\n   ...\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the initial seeding beyond the fact that the bracket is fixed by the order of the teams (as given by the permutation). But wait: the permutation p is arbitrary. However, the bracket structure (which teams play which in each match) is fixed by the initial ordering? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"in the first phase, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\". But note: the teams are labeled by their skill? Not necessarily. The teams are just numbered from 1 to 2^n, but the permutation p assigns the skill values. \n\n However, the problem states: \"the skill level of the i-th team is p_i\", meaning that the team with index i (from 1 to 2^n) has skill p_i. But wait, the input doesn't give the teams in order of index? Actually, the problem says \"You are given a string s ...\", and we are to assign the skills arbitrarily (i.e., we can choose the permutation).\n\n Therefore, we can assign the skill levels arbitrarily to the teams. The catch is: the bracket is fixed by the original ordering of the teams (by index). That is, the bracket structure is:\n\n Round 0: \n   Match0: team0 (index0) vs team1 (index1)\n   Match1: team2 vs team3\n   ...\n\n Round 1 (if needed): \n   The winners of the first round are arranged again: \n        The winner of match0 (teams0 and 1) and the winner of match1 (teams2 and 3) form the next match.\n\n But note: the problem says \"after the first phase, if more than one team remains, the next phase has 2^(n-2) games: in the first one of them, the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", meaning that the bracket is fixed: the winner of the first two matches (which were between teams0-1 and teams2-3) will meet in the next round.\n\n Therefore, the bracket is fixed by the initial numbering (which we can assign arbitrarily the skills). \n\n We are to determine: for which x (from 1 to 2^n) there exists an assignment of the skills (a permutation p) such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Observation: The outcome of each match depends on the two skills and the result condition (given by s). \n\n Since the bracket is fixed, the entire tournament path for a team is determined by the outcomes of the matches. However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily. \n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the teams be numbered 0 to (2^n - 1). The bracket is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves.\n\n The key is: the tournament is deterministic once we assign the skills. We need to check for a given x (which is a skill value) whether we can assign the remaining 2^n - 1 skills such that the team with skill x wins.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what conditions must the skill x satisfy to win?\n\n Consider the path of the champion (skill x) through the tournament. It must win every match it plays. Additionally, we must arrange the rest of the skills so that:\n\n   - In the matches that the champion participates, it must win (according to the condition of the phase).\n   - In the other matches (those that the champion does not participate in), we must arrange the outcomes so that the champion advances and no other team blocks it.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed. The champion must be present in the correct set of matches. Moreover, the bracket requires that the champion must be placed in a leaf. However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can put the champion in any leaf.\n\n However, wait: the problem does not fix the initial positions of the teams. We are free to assign the entire permutation. Therefore, we can assign the champion to any leaf we want. But note: the bracket structure is fixed by the initial ordering. How do we map the champion's skill to the initial ordering?\n\n Actually, the problem says \"the i-th team\" has skill p_i. But note: the initial ordering of the teams (by index) is fixed. We are going to assign the permutation p. We can assign the champion's skill (x) to any team index we wish. However, the bracket structure is defined by the initial indices (so the matches are fixed by the index order). \n\n Therefore, we can choose which leaf the champion is in. But then, the matches the champion must go through are determined by the bracket.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know the bracket structure (like a standard single elimination bracket). We can represent the tournament as a binary tree.\n\n 2. For a fixed x (the champion's skill), we want to know: is there an assignment of the entire set of skills (a permutation) such that:\n      - The champion (with skill x) wins every match it is involved in.\n      - The outcomes of the other matches (that do not involve the champion) are consistent with the given s.\n\n However, note: the condition s[i] for the i-th phase (which is the same for all matches in that phase) might require that in a particular round (say round j) the winner is determined by either the higher or lower skill. But the assignment of skills to the teams (including the ones that are eliminated) must be consistent.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Instead of iterating over all x (which can be up to 2^18 = 262144) and trying to assign the entire permutation (which is factorial time), we need a smarter way.\n\n Another idea: simulate the tournament from the bottom up, and for each node (match) we can determine the condition that the two children (teams) must satisfy to make the parent node have a particular outcome.\n\n However, note: the entire tournament outcome is determined by the fixed bracket and the assignment of the skills. We are free to assign the skills arbitrarily.\n\n We can use dynamic programming over the rounds (from the last round to the first) and consider the set of teams that must have been eliminated by a certain point, and the condition on the skills.\n\n But note: the problem asks for all winning integers (team skills) that can win the tournament.\n\n Observation: the tournament is deterministic once the skills are fixed. And we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, a necessary condition for a skill value x to be able to win is that there exists a path from the leaves (the initial set) to the root (champion) such that:\n\n   - In each match along the path, the condition of the phase (given by s) must allow x to win that match (if the condition is '1', then x must be the maximum in the two teams playing that match; if the condition is '0', then x must be the minimum).\n\n   - Additionally, in the matches that are not on the champion's path, we must be able to assign the remaining skills so that the opponents that the champion faces are indeed the ones that are supposed to lose, and also that the champion does not face an opponent that would prevent it from advancing (due to the conditions).\n\n However, note: the bracket is fixed. The champion must advance through a fixed set of matches (one path). But the opponents in the matches that the champion faces must be chosen from the available skills. Moreover, the conditions in the other matches (that do not involve the champion) must be satisfied by the assignment of the remaining skills.\n\n This seems complex. \n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n Let T = 2^n.\n\n The tournament has n rounds. The rounds (from the first round to the final) are:\n\n   Round 0: 2^(n-1) matches, each match has two teams. The champion must win one of these (if it starts in the first round). Similarly, the champion must win n rounds.\n\n We can think of the champion's journey: it must be the best (or worst) in every match it plays, depending on the condition of the round.\n\n But note: the condition for a round is the same for all matches in that round.\n\n However, wait: the rounds are defined by the phase index (from 0 to n-1). The condition s[i] applies to the (i+1)-th phase? Actually, the problem says:\n   \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\".\n\n Actually, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, the second (i=1) has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n The rounds (from the top) are the final (if n>=1) and then the semi-finals, etc. But the problem describes the phases: the first phase is the one with the most games.\n\n However, note: the champion must win n rounds (because there are 2^n teams and the champion must beat one opponent in each round until the end). But the rounds are not independent: the condition for a given round is fixed (either all matches in that round are decided by the higher skill or by the lower skill).\n\n Now, consider: the champion must be compared in each round to one opponent. However, the bracket structure means that the champion must be the best (if the condition is '1') or the worst (if the condition is '0') in each of the n matches it plays.\n\n But note: the same condition applies to all matches in the same phase (round). However, the rounds are decreasing: the first round (phase0) has the highest number of games (2^(n-1)) and the last round (phase n-1) has 1 game (the final).\n\n However, the rounds are played from the first phase (largest number of games) to the final (smallest). \n\n The challenge: the assignments of the skills to the teams must be consistent. The champion must be the best (or worst) in its own matches, but what about the other matches?\n\n Conditions for the champion's matches:\n\n   Let the champion's skill be x.\n\n   In round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1, where round0 is the first phase and round n-1 is the final), the condition is s[i]. Then, for the champion to win the match in round i, if s[i]=='1', then in that match the champion must have the highest skill among the two teams in that match. If s[i]=='0', then the champion must have the lowest skill.\n\n   But note: the champion's opponents in the subsequent rounds are determined by the outcomes of the other matches.\n\n   However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the champion the value x, and then assign the other skills arbitrarily. But we must ensure:\n\n     - In the champion's matches: the condition holds (so in round i, the two teams in the match are such that the champion is the max (if s[i]=='1') or the min (if s[i]=='0')).\n\n     - In the matches that the champion does not play, we must assign the remaining skills so that the winner of each match is the one that allows the champion to advance.\n\n   However, note: the bracket is fixed. The champion must be placed in a specific leaf. Then, the matches that the champion must win are predetermined (the matches along the path). But we can assign the skills arbitrarily to the other teams.\n\n   Let the champion be placed at a leaf. Then, the champion must win n matches (one per round). In each round i, the champion must be the best (or worst) in the two-team match.\n\n   But wait: the bracket structure: the champion's match in round i is against one specific opponent (which is the winner of the previous round's match). However, we can control the outcomes of the other matches arbitrarily (since we assign the skills arbitrarily). \n\n   Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the champion (with skill x) to win the tournament is:\n\n     - In the first round (round0): the champion must be the best (if s[0]=='1') or the worst (if s[0]=='0') in its two-team match.\n\n     - Then, in the next round (round1): the champion must be the best (if s[1]=='1') or the worst (if s[1]=='0') in the two-team match (which now includes the champion and the winner of the adjacent match from the first round).\n\n   However, note: the bracket groups the winners of the first round into sets of two (then four, then eight, etc.). The champion must be the best (or worst) in the entire set of two teams in its immediate match in the next round.\n\n   But wait: the condition for round1 is the same for all matches in that round. So if the champion is to win the round1 match, then in the match of round1 (which is the second phase) the champion must be the best (if s[1]=='1') or the worst (if s[1]=='0') in that two-team match.\n\n   However, the two teams in round1 match are the champion and one other team (which is the winner of the adjacent first-round match). We can assign the skill of that adjacent first-round match arbitrarily (from the remaining skills). But note: the adjacent first-round match was a match between two teams (which we can assign arbitrarily as well) and the condition for the first round (round0) for that adjacent match is s[0]. \n\n   Therefore, the condition for the champion's match in round1 depends on the skill we assign to the opponent.\n\n   However, we can choose the skills arbitrarily. The constraints are:\n\n     - The champion has skill x.\n\n     - The other skills are distinct integers from 1 to T (where T=2^n) excluding x.\n\n   For the champion to win a match in round i, the opponent must be:\n\n        if s[i]=='1': then the opponent must be < x (so that x is the max) OR wait, no: if the condition is '1' (higher skill wins) then the champion must have a higher skill than the opponent. So the opponent must be less than x.\n\n        if s[i]=='0': then the opponent must be greater than x.\n\n   But note: in round i, the champion is matched against one opponent (from the previous round's bracket). However, the opponent itself must have won a previous round. In the previous round (round i-1), the opponent was the winner of a match (which had two teams). And the condition for that previous round was s[i-1]. \n\n   However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily to the entire set. Therefore, we can assign the champion the value x, and then assign the other skills so that:\n\n        In round0: the two teams in the champion's match are x and some other value y0. Then, according to s[0]:\n            if s[0]=='1', then we require x > y0, and we can choose y0 arbitrarily from the remaining skills (but we must also satisfy the conditions for the other matches in round0).\n\n        But note: the bracket has multiple matches in the same round. The condition for the other matches in round0 (the same round) is also fixed by s[0]. \n\n   This leads to a more global constraint: the entire assignment must satisfy all the matches in the tournament. \n\n   However, note: we are only concerned with the existence of an assignment that makes x win. \n\n   We can use the following idea:\n\n     We are going to consider the entire tournament as a binary tree with 2^n leaves. Each match (node) has two children (teams). The champion must be at one of the leaves, and we must assign the skills so that:\n\n        - Along the champion's path, in round i (which is the match at depth i from the leaf, counting from 0 as the first round) the condition s[i] holds.\n\n        - Additionally, the other matches must be assigned skills so that the winners of the matches are the ones that lead to the champion.\n\n     But note: we don't care about the exact assignment, only about the possibility.\n\n   We can think of the tournament as having a requirement on the relative ranking of the champion and the teams it faces, and also the relative rankings of the teams that are eliminated.\n\n   However, note: the conditions in different rounds are independent. \n\n   Consider: the champion must be the best (or worst) in its own matches. But in the matches that the champion does not play, we can arrange the outcomes arbitrarily (by assigning the skills appropriately) because the condition for those rounds is fixed (all matches in that round use the same rule). \n\n   Therefore, the only constraint on x is from the matches that the champion participates in. Specifically, the champion must be the best (if condition is '1') or the worst (if condition is '0') in each of the n matches it plays.\n\n   But wait: what about the opponents? In the first round, the champion is in a match with one other team. In the second round, the champion is in a match with one other team (which is the winner of the adjacent match). However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily to the other teams, so we can always choose the opponents to be the required ones (as long as the conditions for the matches the champion participates in are satisfied by the value x).\n\n   However, consider: the champion must be the best (or worst) in the entire set of teams that are in the same part of the bracket until the next round? Actually, no: the bracket is fixed, and the champion must only be the best (or worst) in the immediate match. \n\n   But note: the immediate match in round0: two teams. Then, the immediate match in round1: two teams (the champion and one other). The other team in round1 is the winner of the adjacent match in round0. However, the adjacent match in round0 had two teams (which we can assign arbitrarily). We can assign the two teams in the adjacent match to be both less than x (if s[0] is '1') or both greater than x (if s[0] is '0'), so that the winner (which will be the one that is the best/worst in that adjacent match) is then the one that we want to face the champion in the next round.\n\n   However, the condition for the adjacent match in round0 is the same as the condition for the entire round0 (s[0]). So if s[0]=='1', then the winner of the adjacent match is the maximum of the two teams in that adjacent match. Then, for the champion to win the round1 match, the champion must be greater than that winner. But the champion is already greater than the two teams in its own first-round match (if s[0]=='1'). The adjacent match's two teams are arbitrary (we can set them arbitrarily from the remaining skills). \n\n   Therefore, the constraint for the champion's entire journey is:\n\n        Let the champion's skill be x.\n\n        In round i, the champion must be the best (if s[i]=='1') or the worst (if s[i]=='0') in the two-team match.\n\n        Moreover, the set of opponents the champion faces in the subsequent rounds must be chosen from the skills that are available. However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can choose the opponents to be exactly the ones that satisfy the conditions.\n\n   But note: the same condition applies to the entire tournament: the condition for round i is the same for all matches in that round. \n\n   Therefore, the champion must be:\n\n        In round0: the best (if s[0]=='1') or the worst (if s[0]=='0') in a set of two.\n\n        Then, in round1: the best (if s[1]=='1') or the worst (if s[1]=='0') in a set of two (which includes the champion and the winner of the adjacent match).\n\n        But note: the winner of the adjacent match is determined by the condition s[0] (same as round0). \n\n        Example: \n          n=1: only one round (the final). There are two teams. The condition for the final is s[0]. The champion must be the best (if s[0]=='1') or the worst (if s[0]=='0') of the two. Then, the two teams are x and the other skill (which is the complement). \n\n          For n=1, T=2. The two teams have skills [1,2]. \n          If s[0]=='1', then the champion must be the maximum of the two. So the champion must be 2.\n          If s[0]=='0', then the champion must be the minimum, so 1.\n\n        Now, n=2: 4 teams. The bracket:\n\n          Round0 (first phase): two matches: \n              Match0: team0 vs team1 -> winner goes to round1\n              Match1: team2 vs team3 -> winner goes to round1\n\n          Then, round1: the two winners meet.\n\n          The champion must win two rounds.\n\n          Condition for round0: s[0]\n          Condition for round1: s[1]\n\n          The champion must be placed in one of the leaves (say team0). Then:\n\n            In round0: champion (at team0) must be the best (if s[0]=='1') or the worst (if s[0]=='0') in {p0, p1}. \n\n            Then, in round1: the champion must be the best (if s[1]=='1') or the worst (if s[1]=='0') in {p0, winner of match1}. \n\n          But note: the winner of match1 is the max (if s[0]=='1') or the min (if s[0]=='0') of {p2, p3}.\n\n          We can assign the entire permutation arbitrarily.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            Case 1: s[0]=='1' and s[1]=='1'\n\n                Round0: p0 > p1.\n                Round1: p0 > winner(match1). The winner of match1 is max(p2, p3). So we require p0 > max(p2, p3).\n\n                Then, the champion must be greater than p1, p2, and p3. But note: the entire set is {p0, p1, p2, p3} = {1,2,3,4} (if T=4). So p0 must be 4, and then p1, p2, p3 must be {1,2,3}. Then the conditions hold: 4> p1 (which is true since p1<=3) and 4>max(p2,p3) (which is <=3). \n\n                Also, we can assign the other skills arbitrarily as long as they are distinct and from 1 to 4.\n\n                What if we try to use x=3? Then we need to assign the other skills: {1,2,4}. \n                    Round0: 3 must be > p1 -> so p1 must be 1 or 2.\n                    Round1: 3 must be > max(p2, p3). But the remaining two skills (the ones not chosen for p1 and the two in the other match) are the other two. Suppose we assign p1=1, then the other two are {2,4}. Then the winner of match1 is max(2,4)=4. Then 3>4 is false. \n                    Alternatively, assign p1=2, then the other two are {1,4}. Then winner of match1 is 4, and 3>4 fails.\n\n                So for n=2, s=\"11\", the champion must be the overall maximum (4) because it must be greater than all three other teams.\n\n            Case 2: s[0]=='0' and s[1]=='0'\n\n                Round0: p0 < p1 (so the champion loses to p1 in the first round? Wait, no: condition '0' means the lower skill wins. But the champion is p0. Then the condition for the champion's own match: if s[0]=='0', then the champion wins if it is the lower skill. So p0 < p1.\n\n                Then, in round1: the champion must be the lower skill than the winner of match1. The winner of match1 is the minimum (if s[0]=='0') of {p2, p3}. Then, we require p0 < min(p2, p3).\n\n                Then, the champion must be less than p1 (from round0) and less than both p2 and p3 (from round1). So the champion must be the smallest skill.\n\n                Then, if we assign the champion the smallest skill (1), then we can set p1=2, p2=3, p3=4. Then round0: 1<2 -> champion wins. Round1: 1 < min(3,4)=3 -> champion wins.\n\n                If we try x=2: then we need to assign the others {1,3,4}. \n                  Round0: 2 must be < p1 -> so p1 must be 3 or 4. Then the remaining two are {1, the other}. \n                  Then, the other match: the winner is the minimum of the two (since condition s[0]=='0'). So if p2=1, p3=3, then winner is 1. Then in round1: 2 must be < 1 -> fails.\n\n                So x=2 fails.\n\n            Case 3: s[0]=='1' and s[1]=='0'\n\n                Round0: champion must be the best (so p0 > p1).\n                Round1: champion must be the worst (so p0 < winner(match1)).\n\n                The winner of match1 is the best of {p2, p3} (since s[0]=='1'). So we require p0 < best(p2, p3).\n\n                Then, the champion must be greater than p1 and less than the maximum of p2 and p3.\n\n                The entire set of skills is {1,2,...,4}. The champion must be x.\n\n                Conditions: \n                  There must exist p1 < x (for round0) and p2, p3 such that max(p2,p3) > x.\n\n                Also, the remaining two skills (excluding x, p1, and the two in the other match) are none, but wait: the set is {1,2,3,4}. \n\n                Example: x=2.\n                  Then p1 must be <2 -> only 1. Then the other two are 3 and 4. Then the winner of match1 is max(3,4)=4, and 2<4 -> holds. So x=2 is possible.\n\n                Example: x=3.\n                  Then p1 must be <3 -> can be 1 or 2.\n                  Then the other two: the remaining two must include at least one number greater than 3? But the set is {1,2,4}. \n                    If we choose p1=1, then the other two are {2,4}. The winner of match1 is 4, and 3<4 -> holds.\n                    If we choose p1=2, then the other two are {1,4}. The winner is 4, and 3<4 -> holds.\n\n                Example: x=1.\n                  Then p1 must be <1 -> no number available. So fails.\n\n                Example: x=4.\n                  Then p1 must be <4 -> can be 1,2,3. Then the other two: the remaining two, say we choose p1=3, then the other two are {1,2}. Then the winner of match1 is max(1,2)=2, and 4<2 -> fails.\n\n                So for n=2, s=\"10\", the winning integers are 2 and 3.\n\n            Case 4: s[0]=='0' and s[1]=='1'\n\n                Round0: champion must be the worst (so p0 < p1).\n                Round1: champion must be the best (so p0 > winner(match1)).\n\n                The winner of match1 is the worst (min) of {p2, p3} (because s[0]=='0' for the first round, but wait: the condition for the first round is s[0] for all matches in the first round. Then the condition for the second round is s[1] for all matches in the second round.\n\n                So in the second round, the condition is s[1]=='1', meaning the higher skill wins. Therefore, the champion must be the best in the second round, so p0 > winner(match1). The winner of match1 is the minimum of {p2, p3} (because the first round condition is '0').\n\n                Conditions: \n                  Round0: p0 < p1.\n                  Round1: p0 > min(p2, p3).\n\n                Then, the champion must be less than p1 and greater than the minimum of p2 and p3.\n\n                Example: x=2.\n                  Then p1 must be >2 -> can be 3 or 4.\n                  The other two: if we choose p1=3, then the other two are {1,4}. Then the winner of match1 is min(1,4)=1. Then 2>1 -> holds.\n                  If we choose p1=4, then the other two are {1,3}. Then winner is 1, and 2>1 -> holds.\n\n                Example: x=3.\n                  Then p1 must be >3 -> only 4.\n                  The other two: {1,2}. Winner of match1 is 1. Then 3>1 -> holds.\n\n                Example: x=1.\n                  Then p1 must be >1 -> can be 2,3,4.\n                  The other two: say we choose p1=2, then the other two are {3,4}. Winner of match1 is min(3,4)=3. Then 1>3 -> fails.\n\n                Example: x=4.\n                  Then p1 must be >4 -> no number available.\n\n                So for n=2, s=\"01\", the winning integers are 2 and 3.\n\n   After analyzing, we see:\n\n        In the first round, the condition for the champion's own match is s[0]. Then, in the second round, the condition for the champion's match is s[1]. \n\n        The champion must be:\n\n          - In round0: if s[0]=='1', then the champion must be the maximum of the two teams in its first match. If s[0]=='0', then the champion must be the minimum.\n\n          - In round1: if s[1]=='1', then the champion must be the maximum of the two teams in its second match. If s[1]=='0', then the champion must be the minimum.\n\n        However, the two teams in the second match are the champion and the winner of the adjacent first-round match.\n\n        The winner of the adjacent first-round match is determined by the condition s[0] (same as the first round) and the two teams in that adjacent match.\n\n        Therefore, the constraints are:\n\n          Let A0 be the set of two teams in the champion's first match.\n          Let B0 be the set of two teams in the adjacent first-round match (the one that feeds into the second match).\n\n          Then, the second match is {champion, winner(B0)}.\n\n          The winner(B0) is:\n            if s[0]=='1': max(B0)\n            if s[0]=='0': min(B0)\n\n        Then, for the second round:\n\n          if s[1]=='1': champion must be > winner(B0)\n          if s[1]=='0': champion must be < winner(B0)\n\n        And the entire set of skills is {1,2,...,4}. The champion's skill is x, and the other three skills are assigned to the three teams (one in A0 and two in B0).\n\n        How to generalize for n rounds?\n\n        We can think of the bracket as a binary tree with n levels (from the leaves to the root). The champion must be the best (if condition is '1') or the worst (if condition is '0') in each match it plays. Moreover, the opponents it faces in the subsequent rounds are the winners of the subtrees of the bracket.\n\n        We can define:\n\n          Let the champion be at a leaf. Then, the entire tournament can be divided into segments (the bracket). \n\n          The champion must be:\n\n            In round0 (first match): \n               if s[0]=='1', then champion > the other team in its match.\n               if s[0]=='0', then champion < the other team in its match.\n\n            Then, in round1 (second match): \n               if s[1]=='1', then champion > the winner of the adjacent segment (which is the best of the two teams in the adjacent match, if s[0]=='1'; or the worst, if s[0]=='0').\n\n            But note: the adjacent segment (the two teams) are subject to the condition s[0]. \n\n        We can define a function f(i, x) that returns whether there exists an assignment for the entire tournament such that the champion (with skill x) wins, given that we are at round i (from 0 to n-1) and the condition string s.\n\n        However, the state space is too big (x up to 2^18, and n up to 18) so we cannot iterate over x and do a DP with 2^18 states.\n\n        Alternative Insight:\n\n        Consider the entire tournament: the champion must be the best (if all conditions are '1') or the worst (if all conditions are '0')? But that is not the case.\n\n        We can think of the tournament as imposing constraints on the rank of the champion. Specifically, the champion must be:\n\n          - Greater than a certain set of teams (if the condition is '1') or less than a certain set (if the condition is '0').\n\n        But note: the conditions in the rounds are fixed, and the bracket structure forces the champion to face a sequence of opponents that are the winners of the subtrees.\n\n        We can compute the minimal and maximal skill that the champion must have.\n\n        Let L(x) be the minimal number of teams that must be less than x (if the conditions require the champion to be the maximum in some matches and the minimum in others) and similarly for R(x). \n\n        However, we can also consider:\n\n          In the first round: \n            Condition s[0] requires that in the champion's first match, there is one team that is either less than x (if s[0]=='1') or greater than x (if s[0]=='0').\n\n          In the second round:\n            Condition s[1] requires that the champion must be compared to the winner of the adjacent match. The winner of the adjacent match is the maximum (if s[0]=='1') or the minimum (if s[0]=='0') of the two teams in that adjacent match.\n\n          Then, the condition for the second round requires:\n            if s[1]=='1': x > winner(adjacent) \n            if s[1]=='0': x < winner(adjacent)\n\n        And the adjacent match has two teams. The condition for the adjacent match is s[0]. \n\n        We can formulate constraints on x:\n\n          Let the champion be x.\n\n          Then, the adjacent match (which has two teams) must be assigned two skills (from the remaining 2^n - 1 skills). \n\n          The winner of the adjacent match is:\n            if s[0]=='1': the maximum of the two teams in the adjacent match.\n            if s[0]=='0': the minimum.\n\n          Then, the condition for the second round (s[1]) requires:\n\n            if s[1]=='1': x > winner(adjacent)\n            if s[1]=='0': x < winner(adjacent)\n\n          But note: the adjacent match is one of the matches in the first round. The entire tournament has 2^(n-1) matches in the first round. The champion's match and the adjacent match are two of them.\n\n        We can generalize:\n\n          The tournament can be broken down into rounds. In round i, the champion is in a match that is fed by two subtrees (each subtree being the results",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible skill levels (integers) that can win a tournament given a specific sequence of game outcomes. The tournament involves \\(2^n\\) teams, and the outcome of each phase is determined by a binary string where '1' means the higher-skilled team wins and '0' means the lower-skilled team wins. The solution involves analyzing the tournament structure and the given outcome conditions to identify which skill levels can potentially win the tournament.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket with \\(n\\) phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in the input string (either '0' or '1'). The goal is to find all skill levels \\(x\\) such that there exists a permutation of skills (assigning distinct integers from 1 to \\(2^n\\)) where the team with skill \\(x\\) wins the tournament.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a skill level \\(x\\) to win the tournament, it must satisfy specific conditions in each phase it participates in. Specifically:\n   - In the first phase, \\(x\\) must be the highest (if the condition is '1') or the lowest (if the condition is '0') in its initial match.\n   - In subsequent phases, \\(x\\) must continue to be the highest or lowest in its matches, depending on the phase's condition. The opponents in these matches are determined by the winners of previous rounds, which themselves depend on the outcomes of prior matches.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking each possible skill level \\(x\\) from 1 to \\(2^n\\) to see if it meets all the necessary conditions for winning the tournament. For each \\(x\\), we simulate the tournament by ensuring that in each phase, \\(x\\) can be the winner based on the given conditions and the remaining available skill levels.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each of the \\(2^n\\) skill levels. For each skill level, it verifies up to \\(n\\) conditions (one per phase). Since \\(n\\) can be up to 18, \\(2^n\\) is up to 262,144, making the approach feasible with efficient condition checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    candidates = set(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n    result_set = set()\n    \n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        valid = True\n        remaining = set(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n        remaining.discard(x)\n        current_round = 0\n        \n        while valid and current_round < len(s):\n            c = s[current_round]\n            if c == '1':\n                needed = 'max'\n            else:\n                needed = 'min'\n                \n            if current_round % 2 == 0:\n                # In even rounds (0-indexed), the champion must be the max in its match\n                if needed == 'max':\n                    # We need to assign one opponent that is less than x\n                    found = False\n                    for candidate in sorted(remaining, reverse=True):\n                        if candidate < x:\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if not found:\n                        valid = False\n                else:\n                    # needed is 'min': so we need an opponent greater than x\n                    found = False\n                    for candidate in sorted(remaining):\n                        if candidate > x:\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if not found:\n                        valid = False\n            else:\n                # Odd rounds: the champion must be the min or max of the two teams in the match (champion and the winner of the adjacent match)\n                if needed == 'max':\n                    # The champion must be greater than the winner of the adjacent match\n                    # The winner of the adjacent match is the maximum of the two teams in the adjacent match (since the condition for the previous round was '1')\n                    # But note: the previous round condition might have been '0', so we need to consider the winner of the adjacent match under the previous round's condition.\n                    # However, we don't know the exact assignment, but we know that the adjacent match had two teams, and their winner is either the max or min based on the previous round's condition.\n                    # Let prev_c = s[current_round -

In odd-numbered phases, it also checks the winner of the adjacent match from the previous phase.\n4. **Validation**: The code checks if the remaining skill levels can satisfy the conditions for each phase. If all conditions are met, \\(x\\) is added to the set of valid skill levels.\n5. **Output**: The valid skill levels are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each potential skill level against the tournament conditions, ensuring correctness while handling the constraints effectively.",
