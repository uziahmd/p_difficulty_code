A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend's toast)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend's toast)\n\n However, note that the problem states:\n   Each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt for a toast.\n\n But note: the toast is made by each friend. So for one toast (by one friend) we need:\n   - nl milliliters of the drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n Since there are n friends, and they all must make the same number of toasts, say t, then for one toast (by one friend) the requirements are as above.\n\n Therefore, the total requirements for t toasts per friend (so t * n toasts in total) are:\n   - Drink: t * n * nl milliliters\n   - Lime slices: t * n * 1 slices\n   - Salt: t * n * np grams\n\n But note: the drink is available from k bottles of l milliliters -> total_drink = k * l\n           the lime slices are available from c limes, each cut into d slices -> total_slices = c * d\n           the salt is available as p grams.\n\n So the constraints are:\n   t * n * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   t * n <= c * d        => t <= (c * d) / n\n   t * n * np <= p       => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend\" makes t toasts, so the total toasts is n*t.\n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n   Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml. For 3 friends toasting t times: 3*t*3 = 9t ml. 9t <= 20 -> t <= 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so t can be at most 2 (since t must be integer).\n   Lime slices: 10*8 = 80 slices. 3*t <= 80 -> t <= 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> so t can be up to 26 from lime, but drink restricts to 2.\n   Salt: 3*t*1 <= 100 -> t <= 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> again t up to 33, but drink and lime are more restrictive.\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum t from the three constraints, which is 2.\n\n But note: the example calculation in the problem statement was:\n      min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   How did they get 6? They did: 20 / 3 (ml per toast per friend? Actually, note: the drink constraint was 20 ml for the entire group for one toast? \n\n   Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n   This means that for one toast, one friend requires nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\n   Therefore, for the entire group to make t toasts (each friend t toasts), the drink required is: n * t * nl.\n\n   However, the example calculation was: \n        Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n   Why divided by 3? Because they considered that one toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml? Then if they do 6 toasts, how many friends? \n\n   Actually, the example does not specify per friend. Let me break down:\n\n   They have 20 ml. Each toast (regardless of which friend) requires 3 ml? Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts based on the constraints imposed by the drink, lime slices, and salt. Each friend requires a certain amount of drink, one slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per toast. The solution involves finding the minimum number of toasts possible across all these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the maximum number of toasts each friend can make. Each toast for a friend requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - One slice of lime.\n   - `np` grams of salt.\n   \n   The available resources are:\n   - `k * l` milliliters of drink.\n   - `c * d` slices of lime (since each lime is cut into `d` slices).\n   - `p` grams of salt.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the most limiting resource. We need to calculate the maximum possible toasts from each resource and then take the minimum of these values.\n\n3. **Constraints Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available must be at least `n * t * nl`, where `t` is the number of toasts per friend. This gives `t ≤ (k * l) / (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available must be at least `n * t`. This gives `t ≤ (c * d) / n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available must be at least `n * t * np`. This gives `t ≤ p / (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value derived from the three constraints above. Since the number of toasts must be an integer, we take the floor of the minimum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_limes = c * d\n    \n    constraint1 = total_drink / (n * nl)\n    constraint2 = total_limes / n\n    constraint3 = p / (n * np)\n    \n    t = min(constraint1, constraint2, constraint3)\n    result = int(t)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers which are read and parsed into variables representing the number of friends, bottles, drink per bottle, limes, slices per lime, salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**: The total available drink is computed as `k * l`, and the total available lime slices as `c * d`.\n3. **Constraints Calculation**: Three constraints are derived:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts based on available drink divided by the drink required per toast multiplied by the number of friends.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts based on available lime slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts based on available salt divided by the salt required per toast multiplied by the number of friends.\n4. **Result Determination**: The smallest value among the three constraints is selected, and since the number of toasts must be an integer, it is converted to an integer before printing.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by considering all resource constraints and selecting the most restrictive one to ensure all friends can toast equally without exceeding any resource limits.",
