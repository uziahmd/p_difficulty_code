Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters must be the same (and the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal has the same letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters? Let's read again: \n    - The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    - Then: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n   Input 1: \n      5\n      xooox\n      oxoxo\n      soxoo\n      oxoxo\n      xooox\n\n   This is 'NO' because in the center there is an 's' (which is not the same as the diagonal letter 'x')? Actually, wait:\n\n   In the example, the diagonals should be:\n     Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) -> 'x','o','s','o','x' -> not all same.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\". However, the example input also includes:\n      Input 2: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n      Output: \"YES\"\n\n   Let's check the second example:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n   Diagonals: \n        Main: [w, w, w] -> yes, all 'w'\n        Anti-diagonal: [w, w, w] -> actually: \n            anti-diagonal: first row last: 'w', second row middle: 'w', third row first: 'w'. So both diagonals are 'w'.\n\n   Now the rest of the squares must be the same letter and different from 'w'. The rest are 's'. And indeed, the non-diagonal elements are all 's'. So it's valid.\n\n   But wait, what if the two diagonals have different letters? For example, one diagonal is 'a' and the other is 'b'? Then condition fails because the diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, the problem says \"on both diagonals all letters are the same\", but it doesn't explicitly say that the two diagonals must be the same letter. However, let's re-read: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" — this means that the entire main diagonal is one letter (say, 'a') and the entire anti-diagonal is one letter (say, 'b'). Then we require that the other squares are the same letter and different from the diagonal ones. But then if the two diagonals are different, then we have two different letters? And then the rest must be a third letter? That would be three distinct letters.\n\n   However, the example \"YES\" case has both diagonals as 'w'. So the problem likely intends that the two diagonals must be the same letter. Because otherwise, the example with two different diagonal letters would require the rest to be a third letter, but the problem says \"the same letter\" (singular) that is different from the diagonal letters.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n   This implies that the diagonals might have two different letters? Then the rest must be a third letter? However, the problem says \"the same letter\" (meaning one letter). But then if the diagonals have two different letters, then there is no single letter that is different from both. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n   So the conditions are:\n   Condition 1: The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) consists of a single letter, say `d`.\n   Condition 2: The anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) consists of the same letter `d`.\n   Condition 3: All the other (non-diagonal) cells are the same letter, say `e`, and `e != d`.\n\n   However, note: the diagonals are defined by the set of indices. The main diagonal: i == j. The anti-diagonal: i+j == n-1.\n\n   But wait: in the example with n=5, the center cell (index 2,2) is part of both diagonals? Actually, no: for n=5, the center cell is (2,2) and (2,2) is on the main diagonal, and the anti-diagonal: 2+2 = 4, which is n-1 (n=5 -> n-1=4). So the center is shared by both diagonals.\n\n   So when we check the diagonals, we must ensure that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same, and importantly, the center cell must be the same for both.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n and the grid.\n   2. Check the main diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][i] must be the same letter, say `d`.\n   3. Check the anti-diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][n-1-i] must be the same letter, which should be `d` (same as above).\n   4. Check the rest of the cells (non-diagonal): they must all be the same letter, say `e`, and `e != d`.\n\n   However, note: the center cell is counted in both diagonals. In step 2 and 3, we are going to check the center twice. But that's okay because we already know that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are the same letter.\n\n   Then, for the rest of the cells, we skip the ones that are on either diagonal.\n\n   How to check the rest?\n   For each cell (i, j):\n        if i == j or i+j == n-1: skip (this is the diagonal or anti-diagonal)\n        else: check that the letter is the same (say `e`) and that `e != d`\n\n   But note: what if the grid is such that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are the same, but the rest has two different letters? Then condition 4 fails.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n   Step 2: Determine the diagonal letter `d` from the main diagonal (if the main diagonal is not uniform, then we can immediately say NO).\n\n   Step 3: Check the anti-diagonal: if any element on the anti-diagonal is not `d`, then NO.\n\n   However, wait: what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? Then we break at step 3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let d = grid[0][0]\n   For i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d: then NO.\n\n   Then for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d: then NO.\n\n   Then, let e be the letter we expect for non-diagonal. We can get that by checking the first non-diagonal cell (if there is one). But note: we don't know what letter the non-diagonals are. However, we know that all non-diagonals must be the same and different from d.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Let candidate_e = None\n   For i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if candidate_e is None:\n                candidate_e = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != candidate_e:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   Then, we must also check that candidate_e != d.\n\n   However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For n=1? But n>=3, so there will be non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But wait: the example n=3: total cells 9, diagonal has 3 (main and anti share the center, so 3+3-1=5 cells). Then non-diagonal: 9-5=4. So we have at least one non-diagonal.\n\n   However, what if the grid has only one non-diagonal cell? Then we set candidate_e from that one.\n\n   But note: we must check that every non-diagonal cell is that candidate_e and that candidate_e != d.\n\n   However, there is an edge: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? Actually, n>=3, so minimum n=3: 9-5=4, so always non-diagonals exist.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Check the two diagonals for being the same letter (and same letter for both).\n\n   Step 2: Check all non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   But note: what if the two diagonals are the same, but the non-diagonals are not the same? Then we output NO.\n\n   Also, what if the two diagonals are the same, but the non-diagonals are the same as the diagonal? Then we output NO because the non-diagonals must be different.\n\n   So:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n and grid.\n\n   2. Let d = grid[0][0]\n      For i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              return\n\n      For i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              return\n\n   3. Now, we need to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\n      Let non_diagonal_letter = None\n\n      For i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if non_diagonal_letter is None:\n                  non_diagonal_letter = grid[i][j]\n              else:\n                  if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_letter:\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      return\n\n      If non_diagonal_letter is still None? Then there are no non-diagonal cells. But n>=3, so this shouldn't happen. But if n==1, then we don't have non-diagonal, but n>=3 so we skip.\n\n   4. Check that non_diagonal_letter != d. If not, then NO.\n\n   5. Otherwise, YES.\n\n   However, consider the possibility that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are the same, and the non-diagonals are the same but equal to d? Then we must check non_diagonal_letter != d.\n\n   Example: \n        n=3, grid:\n        aaa\n        aaa\n        aaa\n\n        Then the diagonals are 'a' and the non-diagonals are 'a'. Then we output NO because the non-diagonals are the same as the diagonal.\n\n   But wait, what about the example that was given as NO: \n\n        Input: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n        Here, the diagonals are not uniform: \n          row0: 'x' -> ok\n          row1: 'o' -> but wait, the main diagonal: \n          row0[0] = 'x'\n          row1[1] = 'o' -> not same, so we catch that in step 2.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"NO\", and our step2 would catch that because the main diagonal is not uniform.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n        Output: 'NO'\n\n        Let's check:\n\n        Step2: \n          Main diagonal: ['x','p','e'] -> not all same? \n          Actually, grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1]='p', grid[2][2]='e' -> not same, so we output NO.\n\n   But wait, the example input was:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        The example output is \"NO\".\n\n   However, let me check the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox -> NO\n        Example 2: Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES\n        Example 3: Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> NO\n\n   Our method for example 3: \n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'p'\n            row2: 'e'\n        -> Not uniform, so we output NO.\n\n   But wait, the example 3 input is:\n\n        xpx\n        p x p\n        x p e\n\n        Actually, the third row is \"xpe\", so the main diagonal is [x, p, e] which is not uniform.\n\n   However, note the example 3 is provided as:\n\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n        So the grid is:\n\n        row0: 'x','p','x'\n        row1: 'p','x','p'\n        row2: 'x','p','e'\n\n        Then the main diagonal is [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e'] -> not uniform.\n\n   So our algorithm would correctly say NO for example 3.\n\n   But wait, let's check example 2 again:\n\n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n\n        Grid:\n        row0: 'w','s','w'\n        row1: 's','w','s'\n        row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        Main diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform, so d='w'\n        Anti-diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform, so same as d.\n\n        Then check non-diagonals: \n            row0: index (0,1) -> 's'\n            row1: index (1,0) and (1,2) -> 's' and 's'\n            row2: index (2,1) -> 's'\n\n        So non_diagonal_letter = 's', and 's' != 'w' -> YES.\n\n   But wait, the example 3 is provided as:\n\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n        But note: the example input string is written as: \n            ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        So the grid is:\n\n            row0: \"xpx\" -> ['x','p','x']\n            row1: \"pxp\" -> ['p','x','p']\n            row2: \"xpe\" -> ['x','p','e']\n\n        And the main diagonal is: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'x'\n            row2: 'e'\n\n        So not uniform.\n\n   However, what if the grid is:\n\n        3\n        xxx\n        xyy\n        xxx\n\n        Then main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not uniform.\n\n   But consider a grid where the diagonals are uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform with the same letter, but the non-diagonals are uniform and different?\n\n   Example:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aba\n        ccc   -> wait, no.\n\n        Let's build one:\n\n        We want both diagonals to be the same letter, say 'a', and the non-diagonals to be the same letter, say 'b'.\n\n        Grid:\n\n        a b a\n        b a b\n        a b a\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> yes.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> yes.\n\n        Non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 'b'\n            (1,0): 'b'\n            (1,2): 'b'\n            (2,1): 'b'\n\n        So non-diagonals are 'b', which is different from 'a'. Then we output YES.\n\n   But wait, the example above is symmetric and forms an X? Actually, the letter 'X' is formed by having the diagonals (the two diagonals) as the center and the arms, and the background is a solid color. So this is a typical X.\n\n   However, the example provided in the problem is:\n\n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n\n        Which is:\n\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n        This is similar: the diagonals are 'w' and the non-diagonals are 's'.\n\n   So the code:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   # Step 1: Check main diagonal\n   d = grid[0][0]\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Step 2: Check anti-diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Step 3: Check non-diagonal cells\n   non_diag_char = None\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   # If we haven't found any non-diagonal cell (which shouldn't happen for n>=3) then non_diag_char is None, but n>=3 so skip.\n\n   # Now, check that the non-diagonal letter is different from d.\n   if non_diag_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\n   print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, wait: what if the grid is:\n\n        3\n        aaa\n        aab\n        aaa\n\n        Then main diagonal: [a,a,a] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n\n        Then non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, the non-diagonals are not allowed to be 'a' (because d='a'), so we require non_diag_char != 'a'. \n\n        But (0,1) is 'a', so we set non_diag_char = 'a', then check the rest: (1,0) is 'a', (1,2) is 'b', (2,1) is 'a'. \n        When we see (1,2) which is 'b', then we compare: non_diag_char is 'a' and grid[1][2] is 'b' -> not equal -> print \"NO\".\n\n        So it works.\n\n   But wait, what if the non-diagonals are not all the same? Then we break in the inner loop.\n\n   This algorithm seems to cover the cases.\n\n   However, let me test with the example that the problem says \"NO\":\n\n        Example 1: \n           5\n           xooox\n           oxoxo\n           soxoo\n           oxoxo\n           xooox\n\n        Step1: \n           Check main diagonal: \n               row0: 'x'\n               row1: 'o' -> already fails, so we output \"NO\".\n\n        Example 3:\n           3\n           xpx\n           pxp\n           xpe\n\n        Step1: \n           Check main diagonal: \n               row0: 'x'\n               row1: 'p' -> fails, so output \"NO\".\n\n   But wait, the example 3 input is:\n\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n        The main diagonal is: \n           grid[0][0] = 'x'\n           grid[1][1] = 'x' (from the second row: \"pxp\": index1 is the second character, which is 'x')\n           grid[2][2] = 'e'\n\n        So the main diagonal is ['x','x','e'] -> not uniform, so we output \"NO\".\n\n   However, the example 3 is provided as:\n\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n        But wait, the second row is \"pxp\", so the element at (1,1) is the second row and second column -> that's the middle of the second row: \n            row1: \"pxp\" -> index0: 'p', index1: 'x', index2: 'p'\n\n        So (1,1) is 'x'. Then the main diagonal is [x, x, e] -> two x's and one e -> not uniform.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\", and we output \"NO\", so correct.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the anti-diagonal might be checked even if the main diagonal fails? But we break at the first failure.\n\n   We can optimize: we break at the first failure.\n\n   But note: the problem says the grid is n x n (with n odd and >=3). \n\n   One more test: \n\n        Example: \n          3\n          aaa\n          aba\n          aaa\n\n        This is a common pattern for X. Let's check:\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n\n        Non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, this is the top middle. Then non_diag_char becomes 'a'. Then we check the rest:\n            (1,0): 'a' -> same, okay.\n            (1,2): 'b' -> not same as 'a', so we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, this grid is:\n\n            aaa\n            aba\n            aaa\n\n        The diagonals are all 'a', but the non-diagonals are not all the same: the center is 'a' (which is allowed to be the same as the diagonal? No, because the condition is that the non-diagonals must be the same and different from the diagonal. The center is a diagonal cell, so we skip it. The non-diagonal cells are:\n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, (0,1) is not a diagonal? \n            Diagonal: i==j -> (0,0),(1,1),(2,2)\n            Anti-diagonal: i+j = 2 (for n=3, index from 0 to 2) -> (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\n            So (0,1) is not a diagonal (0!=1 and 0+1=1 !=2) -> so it's non-diagonal.\n\n            Similarly, (1,0) is non-diagonal, (1,2) is non-diagonal, (2,1) is non-diagonal.\n\n        In the grid:\n\n            row0: [0,0] is diagonal, [0,1] non-diagonal, [0,2] anti-diagonal.\n            row1: [1,0] non-diagonal, [1,1] diagonal, [1,2] non-diagonal.\n            row2: [2,0] anti-diagonal, [2,1] non-diagonal, [2,2] diagonal.\n\n        So non-diagonal cells are: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n        In the grid:\n            (0,1): 'a'\n            (1,0): 'a'\n            (1,2): 'b'\n            (2,1): 'a'\n\n        So we have two 'a's and one 'b'. Therefore, the non-diagonals are not the same. So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   Another test: \n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aab\n        aba\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n\n        Non-diagonals: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> non_diag_char = 'a'\n            (1,0): 'a' -> ok\n            (1,2): 'b' -> not 'a' -> NO.\n\n   So the algorithm is working.\n\n   However, note: the two diagonals must be the same letter. What if the two diagonals are the same, but the anti-diagonal is uniform with a different letter than the main diagonal? Then we catch that in step2.\n\n   Example:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aab\n        baa\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> wait, the anti-diagonal: \n            row0: last element -> 'a'\n            row1: middle -> 'a'\n            row2: first element -> 'b' -> so anti-diagonal is [a, a, b] -> not uniform, so we output NO.\n\n   But wait, the anti-diagonal is defined as i+j = n-1 (for n=3, n-1=2). So for i=0, j=2; i=1, j=1; i=2, j=0.\n\n        row0: grid[0][2] = 'a'\n        row1: grid[1][1] = 'a'\n        row2: grid[2][0] = 'b'\n\n        So anti-diagonal is ['a','a','b'] -> not uniform, so we output NO.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: We are reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the grid might be large (n<300, so maximum 299x299). The algorithm is O(n^2) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example input format: the first line is n, then n lines of n letters.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   d = grid[0][0]\n\n   # Check main diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Check anti-diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Check non-diagonal cells\n   found_non_diag = False\n   non_diag_char = None\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            # We found at least one non-diagonal cell\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                found_non_diag = True\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   # If we didn't find any non-diagonal cell, then n must be 1, but n>=3, so we assume there is at least one non-diagonal.\n   if not found_non_diag:\n        # According to the problem, n>=3, so this case should not occur.\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\n   if non_diag_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\n   print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, we can avoid the flag by checking non_diag_char is not None and then the condition.\n\n   But wait, what if n=1? Then we never enter the non-diagonal loop, and then we check `found_non_diag` is False and output \"NO\". But the problem says n>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set non_diag_char by using the first non-diagonal cell we meet. Since n>=3, we are guaranteed to have at least one non-diagonal.\n\n   We can remove the flag and just check that non_diag_char is not None. But if we don't find any non-diagonal, then non_diag_char remains None and then we check non_diag_char==d -> which is None==d -> false, so we go to the next condition. But wait, we must ensure that we check the non_diag_char != d only if we have found one.\n\n   Revised without flag:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   d = grid[0][0]\n\n   # Check main diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Check anti-diagonal\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   # Now, we know there is at least one non-diagonal cell (since n>=3, total cells n*n, and the diagonals cover 2*n-1 cells, so non-diagonal cells = n*n - (2*n-1) = (n-1)*(n-1) >= 4 for n>=3)\n   non_diag_char = None\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n   # Now, if we have set non_diag_char, then check it is different from d.\n   if non_diag_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\n   print(\"YES\")\n\n   Let me test with a valid one:\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        Step1: d='w'\n        Main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n\n        Then non_diag_char: first non-diagonal at (0,1): 's'\n        Then we check the rest: (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s' -> all same.\n\n        Then check 's' != 'w' -> True, so print \"YES\".\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the grid is:\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            www\n            www\n            www\n\n        Then main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n\n        Then non_diag_char: first non-diagonal (0,1): 'w' -> then we check the rest: all 'w'\n\n        Then we check: non_diag_char ('w') == d ('w') -> True, so we output \"NO\".\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another test: \n\n        n=3, grid:\n            aba\n            bbb\n            aba\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not uniform (because d='a' and we have 'b') -> NO.\n\n   It works.\n\n   I think we are good.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'o' -> already breaks, so output \"NO\".\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> \"YES\"\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> \n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'x' (from \"pxp\": the middle of second row is the second character, which is 'x')\n            row2: 'e' -> breaks, so \"NO\"\n\n   But wait, the example 3 input is given as:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        So the grid is:\n\n            row0: \"xpx\" -> ['x','p','x']\n            row1: \"pxp\" -> ['p','x','p']\n            row2: \"xpe\" -> ['x','p','e']\n\n        Then the main diagonal: \n            [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] = ['x','x','e'] -> not uniform.\n\n        So we break at the third element of the main diagonal (i=2). \n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example 3 input as provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\", and our program outputs \"NO\", so that matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input string in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   But the actual input might be given as:\n\n        Input: \n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n   And that's what we tested.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking two main conditions:\n   - **Diagonals Condition**: All characters on both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) must be identical.\n   - **Non-Diagonals Condition**: All characters not on either diagonal must be identical and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves:\n   - First, verifying that all elements on the main diagonal are the same.\n   - Then, verifying that all elements on the anti-diagonal are the same as the main diagonal's character.\n   - Finally, ensuring that all remaining elements (non-diagonal) are the same and distinct from the diagonal character.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm checks each element of the grid in sequence:\n   - For the main diagonal, iterate through each element where the row index equals the column index.\n   - For the anti-diagonal, iterate through each element where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (the grid size minus one).\n   - For non-diagonal elements, collect the first encountered character and verify all others match it, while also ensuring it differs from the diagonal character.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element of the grid exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(n²), where n is the grid size. This is efficient given the constraint `n < 300`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    d = grid[0][0]\n    \n    # Check main diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_char is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself from standard input.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The main diagonal is checked by verifying all elements from `(0,0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` are the same. Similarly, the anti-diagonal is checked from `(0, n-1)` to `(n-1, 0)`.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code scans all elements not on the diagonals. The first non-diagonal element sets the expected character, and subsequent elements must match this character. If any element differs, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Final Verification**: After confirming all non-diagonal elements match, the code checks if this character differs from the diagonal character. If not, the answer is \"NO\"; otherwise, it prints \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions for the grid to form an \"X\" by leveraging systematic checks across the grid.",
