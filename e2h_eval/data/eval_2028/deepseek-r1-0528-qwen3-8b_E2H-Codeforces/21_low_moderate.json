The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one for the chests (a_i) and one for the keys (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open a chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning they must have opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd.\n   If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\n We can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups: even_chests (where a_i % 2 == 0) and odd_chests (a_i % 2 == 1).\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into even_keys (b_j % 2 == 0) and odd_keys (b_j % 2 == 1).\n\n Now, note the matching:\n   - Even chests require odd keys.\n   - Odd chests require even keys.\n\n But we cannot use a key more than once and a chest only once.\n\n Therefore, we have two bipartite graphs (actually two independent matchings):\n\n   Matching 1: even_chests can be matched with odd_keys.\n   Matching 2: odd_chests can be matched with even_keys.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to use all keys or chests, but maximum matching.\n\n Since the conditions are independent (even chests only take odd keys and odd chests only take even keys),\n we can solve each part independently.\n\n But note: the total matching is the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n How to compute the maximum matching for one part?\n\n For example, for even_chests and odd_keys:\n   We have a set of even_chests and a set of odd_keys. But note: the condition is automatically satisfied by the parity separation.\n\n However, note: there is no restriction beyond parity. So we can use any odd key for any even chest, and similarly for the other.\n\n This is a bipartite graph with complete edges between even_chests and odd_keys? Actually, the condition is already met for every even_chest with every odd_key, so it's a complete bipartite graph.\n\n Then the maximum matching in a complete bipartite graph is the minimum of the two set sizes? Not exactly, because we can choose which ones to use.\n\n Actually, we are limited by the smaller of the two sets? No, because we can assign at most min(|even_chests|, |odd_keys|) for the even_chests.\n\n Similarly, for odd_chests and even_keys, we can assign at most min(|odd_chests|, |even_keys|).\n\n But wait: is that the entire story? \n\n However, note: we have two independent sets. The matching from even_chests to odd_keys and odd_chests to even_keys do not interfere.\n\n Therefore, the answer would be:\n   matching1 = min(len(even_chests), len(odd_keys))\n   matching2 = min(len(odd_chests), len(even_keys))\n\n Then total matching = matching1 + matching2\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Separate chests:\n     9 -> odd\n     14 -> even\n     6 -> even\n     2 -> even\n     11 -> odd\n\n     even_chests: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n     odd_chests: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Separate keys:\n     8 -> even\n     4 -> even\n     7 -> odd\n     20 -> even\n\n     even_keys: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n     odd_keys: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then:\n     matching1 = min(3, 1) = 1\n     matching2 = min(2, 3) = 2\n\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example output.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10], keys = [5]\n\n   Chests: all even -> even_chests: 5, odd_chests:0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_keys:1, even_keys:0\n\n   matching1 = min(5,1)=1\n   matching2 = min(0,0)=0\n   Total=1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests=[10], keys=[20,30,40,50]\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chests:1, odd_chests:0\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching chests and keys based on their parity (even or odd). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - Chests are divided into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - Keys are similarly divided into even-numbered and odd-numbered keys.\n\n2. **Matching Process**:\n   - Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Matches**:\n   - For even-numbered chests and odd-numbered keys, the maximum number of matches is the minimum of the counts of these two groups.\n   - Similarly, for odd-numbered chests and even-numbered keys, the maximum matches is the minimum of their respective counts.\n\n4. **Sum the Matches**: The total number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the matches from both scenarios.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    odd_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chests += 1\n            \n    even_keys = 0\n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n        else:\n            odd_keys += 1\n            \n    match1 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    match2 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    \n    result = match1 + match2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: The chests and keys are categorized into even and odd based on their numbers. This helps in identifying which keys can potentially open which chests.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of matches between even chests and odd keys is determined by the smaller count of the two groups. Similarly, the matches between odd chests and even keys are calculated.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of the matches from both scenarios gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
