His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n, x and then two lists of n integers each: the first tour scores (a) and the second tour scores (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has a total of at least x points. However, the problem is that the results have no names. We have to consider all participants.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have gotten.\n\n 2. Note: The total for a participant i is a_i + b_j (but note: we don't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant? Actually, the input gives two lists: one for the first tour and one for the second tour, but in arbitrary order. However, we are guaranteed that there is at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x (and that participant is Vasya).\n\n 3. But note: each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the second. So we cannot arbitrarily assign the scores. However, the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" (two lists) and the results are in arbitrary order.\n\n 4. The catch: The Olympiad has two tours, and the total table is by the sum of both tours. The same participant's two scores are fixed (each participant has one from the first and one from the second). But the assignment between the two lists is unknown.\n\n 5. Therefore, we can consider that the entire set of participants is defined by the two lists, but we do not know which a_i goes with which b_j. However, the problem states that Vasya is one of the participants (so there is at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x). But note: the other participants are also defined by the two lists.\n\n 6. Actually, we have two lists of n numbers. Each participant has one element from the first list and one from the second. So the entire set of participants is the set of n pairs (a_i, b_j) for some permutation? Actually, it's an assignment: we have to match the two lists. But note: the problem does not specify that the same participant cannot have two different pairs? Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\" meaning each participant has one first-tour score and one second-tour score.\n\n 7. However, the problem does not require us to know the exact matching. Instead, we can consider:\n\n   - For the best place: we want Vasya to have as high a total as possible (so that he is better than as many others as possible). But note: the other participants' totals are fixed by the two lists? Actually, no: because the matching is arbitrary, we can choose which a_i is paired with which b_j for the other participants.\n\n 8. Important: The problem is about the entire set of participants. The two lists are the complete set of scores from the first and second tour. Therefore, the entire set of participants is defined by the multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for all i and j? No, wait: there are exactly n participants, so we must use each a_i exactly once and each b_j exactly once? Actually, no: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", and the same participant appears once in each. So we have two sets of n scores, and we form n pairs (one from the first list and one from the second) to assign to the n participants.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\", meaning two lists of n numbers. Then, the entire set of participants is these n pairs (each participant is assigned one from the first and one from the second). However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not specify the assignment. So we can choose any matching to compute the best and worst case for Vasya.\n\n 10. However, the condition is: Vasya has at least x points. But note: the problem does not tell us which participant is Vasya. We only know that there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. And we are to consider Vasya as having at least x, but we don't know his exact scores. Actually, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j such that ai + bj ≥ x\".\n\n 11. How to approach?\n\n     Let's denote:\n        Let S be the multiset of the first tour scores: [a1, a2, ..., an]\n        Let T be the multiset of the second tour scores",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on the given scores from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total score is at least `x`, and the placement depends on how his scores compare to others when the two lists of scores are optimally or pessimal matched.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists, `a` (first tour scores) and `b` (second tour scores), each of size `n`.\n   - Vasya has a total score of at least `x` from one of the pairs formed by combining elements from `a` and `b`.\n   - The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) possible ranks Vasya could achieve, considering all possible pairings between `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - **Best Place**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with higher total scores than Vasya's maximum possible score. This involves pairing Vasya with the highest possible total score and then counting how many other participants can be formed with totals greater than or equal to this score.\n   - **Worst Place**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to maximize the number of participants with higher total scores than Vasya's minimum possible score. This involves pairing Vasya with the lowest possible total score (just meeting `x`) and then counting how many other participants can be formed with totals greater than or equal to this score.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted to facilitate efficient counting.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For determining the best place, we use two pointers to count participants who could potentially have higher scores than Vasya's best possible score. Similarly, for the worst place, we adjust the pairing strategy to ensure Vasya's score is as low as possible while still being at least `x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time. The subsequent two-pointer operations are O(n) each, leading to an overall O(n log n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the sorted lists, which is optimal given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    # Prepare for best place calculation\n    best_place = 1\n    j = n - 1\n    count_higher = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] > x:\n            count_higher += 1\n            j -= 1\n        if count_higher >= n:\n            break\n    best_place = count_higher + 1\n    \n    # Prepare for worst place calculation\n    k = n - 1\n    count_lower = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while k >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[k] >= x:\n            count_lower += 1\n            k -= 1\n            if k < 0:\n                break\n    worst_place = n - count_lower + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the two lists of scores.\n- **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted to facilitate efficient counting using the two-pointer technique.\n- **Best Place Calculation**: By iterating from the highest scores in both lists, we count how many participants can have a total score higher than Vasya's best possible score. The best place is then `count_higher + 1`.\n- **Worst Place Calculation**: By iterating from the highest scores again, but ensuring Vasya's score is just `x`, we count how many participants must have scores higher than Vasya's worst possible score. The worst place is then `n - count_lower + 1`.\n- **Output**: The best and worst places are printed as two space-separated integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and two-pointer techniques to determine the optimal and pessimistic placements for Vasya, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.",
