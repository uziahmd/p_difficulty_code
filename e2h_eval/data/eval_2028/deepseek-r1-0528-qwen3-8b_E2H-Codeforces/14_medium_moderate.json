He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the number of 5s.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n Then, f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n We are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000). We need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Observation:\n The function f(n) is non-decreasing. However, note that for a fixed m, there might be multiple n with the same f(n)=m.\n\n But note: \n   f(n) increases only when n is a multiple of 5? Actually, it increases by the number of times 5 divides n.\n\n However, we cannot have two consecutive n having the same f(n) for all cases? Actually, sometimes the function stays constant for several numbers.\n\n Example: \n   For n from 1 to 4: f(n)=0.\n   Then n=5: f(5)=1, then n=6,7,8,9: still 1, then n=10: 2, etc.\n\n So, for a given m, we are looking for the set of n such that f(n)=m.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\", so we must avoid any n where the trailing zeros are more than m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (actually, we can use binary search to find the minimal n0 such that f(n0) >= m and then check backwards for the exact m).\n\n However, note: the function f(n) is strictly increasing in steps. We know that:\n\n   Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but actually we want the smallest n such that f(n) = m? Not exactly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can:\n\n   Step 1: Find the range of n for which f(n) = m.\n\n   We can find:\n     lower_bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but we want the smallest n such that f(n) = m? Actually, we can find:\n\n     Let x = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n     Then, we can check if f(x) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m? \n\n   But wait, because the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases by more than 1 sometimes? Actually, when n is a multiple of a high power of 5, the increase might jump.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m is between 1 and 100000.\n\n   Actually, we can use two binary searches:\n\n   - Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this n_low.\n   - Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this n_high.\n\n   Then, the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros are the integers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   But note: what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then n_low would be the first n with at least m, but then f(n_low) might be > m. Then the set of n with exactly m trailing zeros would be empty.\n\n   However, note that the problem states m>=1, and we know that for sufficiently large n, f(n) will eventually reach m. But we must consider that sometimes m might not be achieved? Actually, the function f(n) increases without bound as n increases, so for every m (at least 0) there is an n such that f(n) >= m. However, note that the problem says m>=1.\n\n   But the issue is: the function f(n) does not necessarily hit every integer value. For example, between m=1 and m=2, we have:\n\n      n=5 -> 1\n      n=10 -> 2\n\n   So there is no n with f(n)=1.5? No, because n is integer and f(n) is integer. But wait, the example input m=1 gives output [5,6,7,8,9] meaning that for m=1, there are 5 numbers (n=5 to 9). So actually, for m=1, we do have some n.\n\n   However, note: the example input is 1, and the output is 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   But wait: what about m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   The problem: are there gaps? For example, is there an m that is skipped?\n\n   Consider: \n      m=0: n from 1 to 4 -> but m>=1, so skip.\n\n      m=1: n from 5 to 9 -> yes, 5 numbers.\n\n      m=2: n from 10 to 14 -> 10! has 2, 11! has 2, ... until 14! has 3? Let's check:\n\n          10! -> 2\n          11! -> 2\n          12! -> 2\n          13! -> 2\n          14! -> 2? Actually, let me compute:\n\n          10! = 3628800 -> 2 zeros.\n          11! = 39916800 -> 2 zeros.\n          12! = 479001600 -> 2 zeros.\n          13! = 6227020800 -> 2 zeros? Actually, no: 6227020800 has two zeros at the end? Actually, 6227020800 -> the last two digits are 00, so two zeros.\n\n          But wait, 14! = 87178291200 -> two zeros? Actually, it has two zeros.\n\n          Actually, 14! = 87178291200 -> two zeros.\n\n          Then 15! = 1307674368000 -> three zeros.\n\n          So for m=2, n from 10 to 14: that's 5 numbers.\n\n      m=3: n from 15 to ? Let's see:\n\n          15! -> 3\n          16! -> 3\n          17! -> 3\n          18! -> 3\n          19! -> 3\n          20! -> 4\n\n          So for m=3: n from 15 to 19 -> 5 numbers.\n\n      m=4: n from 20 to 24 -> 5 numbers.\n\n      m=5: \n          25! -> floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6, so m=5: we need to find n such that f(n)=5.\n\n          Actually, we can compute:\n\n          20: 4\n          21: 4\n          22: 4\n          23: 4\n          24: 4\n          25: 6\n\n          So there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, we must account for gaps. \n\n   So, the plan:\n\n   1. Use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. (Let this be low)\n   2. Use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. (Let this be high)\n\n   Then, the numbers n with f(n)=m are the integers from low to high-1, provided that f(low)==m and f(high-1)==m.\n\n   But wait: what if the smallest n such that f(n)>=m is already giving f(n)>m? Then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   Example: m=5, then low would be the smallest n such that f(n)>=5. Since 20:4, 21:4,...,24:4, 25:6 -> so low=25. Then we check f(25)=6 !=5, and the next one is 26,27,28,29,30: still 6. So then there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, we must also check that the minimal n for which f(n)>=m must have f(n)==m. Otherwise, the set is empty.\n\n   Alternatively, we can say:\n\n   Let L = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Let R = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n with f(n)=m are in the interval [L, R-1] if and only if f(L)==m. Otherwise, the set is empty.\n\n   Why? Because if f(L) > m, then even the smallest n that gives at least m has more than m, so there is no n with exactly m.\n\n   But note: we are using the fact that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. So if L is the smallest n with f(n)>=m, then for n < L, f(n) < m. And for n from L to R-1, we have f(n) = m? Not necessarily.\n\n   Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases in steps. However, when we jump from one multiple of 5 to the next, the value of f(n) may jump by more than one.\n\n   Example: m=5. Then L=25, and f(25)=6. Then the next value is 26:6, 27:6, 28:6, 29:6, 30:7. So the values 5 is never reached.\n\n   So the condition is: the numbers n with f(n)=m must be the ones that are in the interval [L, R-1] and for which f(n)=m. But note: if f(L)=6, then even though the interval [25,29] has n with f(n)=6, we are interested in m=5 and that interval doesn't contain 5.\n\n   Therefore, we must check the value at L: if f(L) != m, then there are no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: we found L as the smallest n with f(n)>=m. Then if f(L) > m, then there is no n with f(n)=m. But wait: what if there is a gap? Actually, the function f(n) is defined for integers and increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n. But note that the increase is at most the exponent of 5 in n (which is at least 1 for multiples of 5). However, the jump can be more than 1 (if n is divisible by 25, then we add 2, etc.). Therefore, it is possible that m is skipped.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Step 2: Find R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, if f(L) == m, then the numbers n with f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1 (inclusive). The count is (R - L).\n\n   But if f(L) != m (meaning f(L) > m), then there are 0 numbers.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m>=1. Also, we must consider that the function f(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued, so if L is the smallest n with f(n)>=m and f(L) != m, then indeed m was skipped.\n\n   But wait: what if m is skipped? Then we output 0 and nothing else? Actually, the problem says: First print k (the number of values) and then the list (if k>0, then the k integers in increasing order).\n\n   However, note: the example input ['1'] outputs 5 numbers. But what if the input is m=5? Then output should be 0.\n\n   Implementation of f(n): \n\n      def trailing_zeros(n):\n          count = 0\n          divisor = 5\n          while divisor <= n:\n              count += n // divisor\n              divisor *= 5\n\n   Then, we need to do two binary searches for L and R.\n\n   The range for n: since m up to 100000, we need to find n such that f(n) >= 100000.\n\n   How big can n be? \n\n      f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n      We know that n/4 is an upper bound (since 1/5 + 1/25 + ... <= 1/4). So n needs to be at least 4*m. But m can be 100000, so n can be up to around 400000? Actually, we can use binary search from 0 to, say, 500000.\n\n   Steps for binary search:\n\n      To find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m:\n\n        low_bound = 0\n        high_bound = 500000   (or maybe even higher? but 500000 should be enough because 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... is about 100000, so for m=100000, we need to go to about 400000, but let's set high_bound = 500000)\n\n      While low_bound < high_bound:\n          mid = (low_bound+high_bound)//2\n          if f(mid) >= m:\n              high_bound = mid\n          else:\n              low_bound = mid+1\n\n      Then L = low_bound.\n\n   Similarly for m+1.\n\n   However, note: if m is very large, say 100000, then we need to compute f(n) for n up to about 500000. The function f(n) is efficient (log base 5 of n) so it's about 7 or 8 iterations per call.\n\n   But we do two binary searches, each over about 500000 numbers, so about 19*2 = 38 calls to f(n). That is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\n   Example: m=1\n\n      L: smallest n such that f(n)>=1 -> n=5\n      R: smallest n such that f(n)>=2 -> n=10\n\n      Then, the numbers are from 5 to 9. Count=5.\n\n   Example: m=5\n\n      L: smallest n such that f(n)>=5 -> \n          n=20: f(20)=4 -> too low.\n          n=21:4, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:6 -> so L=25.\n      Then check: f(25)=6 !=5 -> so no n.\n\n   Example: m=0 (even though not required) would be handled similarly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   But wait: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   Edge: m=100000.\n\n   We must compute L and R for m=100000.\n\n   Let's test with m=100000:\n\n      We'll do binary search for L: smallest n such that f(n) >= 100000.\n\n      We can approximate: \n        n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4, so n>=400000.\n\n      Then we can set our high_bound to 500000.\n\n   Code:\n\n      m = int(input().strip())\n\n      def f(n):\n          count = 0\n          i = 5\n          while i <= n:\n              count += n // i\n              i *= 5\n          return count\n\n      # Binary search for L: smallest n with f(n) >= m\n      lo, hi = 0, 500000\n      while lo < hi:\n          mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n          if f(mid) >= m:\n              hi = mid\n          else:\n              lo = mid + 1\n\n      L = lo\n\n      # Now for m+1, unless m is the maximum we can get? But note: if m is the maximum, then R would be beyond the range we set? But we set hi=500000, and we know that for n=500000, f(n) is about 100000 (actually, let me compute: 500000//5=100000, 500000//25=20000, 500000//125=4000, 500000//625=800, 500000//3125=160, 500000//15625=32, 500000//78125=6, 500000//390625=1, then total ~100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+6+1 = 124999). So for m=100000, m+1=100001, and we need to find the smallest n such that f(n)>=100001. We can use the same hi=500000, but note that 500000 gives 124999, so we might need to set hi higher? \n\n      Actually, we set hi=500000 arbitrarily. But 500000 is enough for m up to 124999? Then for m=125000, we would need a higher hi.\n\n      The problem says m up to 100000, so we are safe with hi=500000 because 500000 gives 124999 which is greater than 100000.\n\n      But wait, we set hi=500000 for the first binary search, and then for the second we use the same hi. However, if m=100000, then we are searching for the smallest n with f(n)>=100001. We know that 500000 gives 124999, so the n for m+1 is definitely less than 500000? Actually, we might need to extend the hi for the second binary search? \n\n      Actually, the function f(n) is increasing, so the n for m+1 might be larger than the n for m, but we set hi=500000 and we know that for n=500000, f(n)=124999, so if m+1 is 100001, then we are looking for n such that f(n)>=100001. The first n that gives 100001 might be less than 500000.\n\n      However, to be safe, we can set the hi for both binary searches to the same value: 500000, because 500000 is more than enough for m up to 100000 (and we are only going to 100001, which is still below 124999). \n\n      But what if m is 125000? Then we would need a larger hi. But the problem says m from 1 to 100000, so we are safe.\n\n      Alternatively, we can set hi to something like 5 * m * 5? Actually, we can set hi to 5*m (but then for m=100000, 500000 is 5*m, which is acceptable). But note: the formula says n is about 4*m, so 5*m is safe.\n\n      However, the problem says m up to 100000, so we set hi=500000 (which is 5*100000) is safe.\n\n      Now, if we find L and then R, then:\n\n          if f(L) != m:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              print(R - L)\n              # Then print the numbers from L to R-1? But wait, the problem says: first print k, then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n          However, note: the example output for m=1 is:\n              5\n              5 6 7 8 9\n\n          But the problem says: First print k (which is 5) and then the k integers.\n\n          But note: the sample output is written as: \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\"\n\n          However, wait: the sample input is provided as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000)\n\n          Output: First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n          So if k>0, we output two lines: first the integer k, then the k integers (space separated).\n\n          If k==0, we output 0 (and then nothing? Or just the integer 0? The problem says: first print k. Then, if k>0, print the k integers. So for k=0, we only output 0.\n\n          But note: the example input ['1', '5'] is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is shown as:\n\n            Input: ['1', '5']\n\n          This is confusing. Actually, the problem says the input is one integer. So we read one integer.\n\n          However, the example output is shown as:\n\n            ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n          This seems to be two outputs: one for input 1 and one for input 5. But the problem says one input per run.\n\n          So we assume one input.\n\n          But wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives an example input and output. The example input is \"1\" and the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", and for input \"5\" the output is \"0\".\n\n          However, note: the example input is given as two separate examples? Actually, the problem says:\n\n            Input: ['1', '5']\n\n          This is probably a typo. The intended meaning is that the input can be either 1 or 5. \n\n          But in the code, we read one integer.\n\n          So let's code accordingly.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Read m (as integer)\n\n        Compute L and R (using binary search for f(n)>=m and f(n)>=m+1)\n\n        Check if f(L) == m:\n            k = R - L   (because n from L to R-1: inclusive)\n            Then, we output:\n                print(k)\n                if k>0:\n                    # Format the numbers from L to R-1 (both inclusive) as space separated string\n                    print(\" \".join(str(i) for i in range(L, R)))\n            But wait: the example m=1: \n                L=5, R=10 -> then k=5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 -> which is from 5 to 9 (inclusive) -> that's 5 numbers.\n\n            However, note: R is the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1, so the n from L to R-1 are the ones with f(n)=m.\n\n        Else:\n            print(0)\n\n      But note: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n      However, there is a catch: if m is very large such that R is beyond 500000? Then our binary search for R would not find a solution because we set hi=500000. But note: the problem says m<=100000, and we know that f(500000) is 124999, so for m=100000, m+1=100001, and 500000 is enough because 100001 <= 124999.\n\n      But if m=124999, then we are looking for n such that f(n)>=125000, and we set hi=500000, then we will find n (because f(500000)=124999, so we need a larger n). So we must set hi higher.\n\n      However, the problem says m from 1 to 100000, so we are safe. But if we were to handle m up to 124999, then we need to set hi to a higher value.\n\n      Since the problem states m<=100000, we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, let me double-check the bounds:\n\n        m_max = 100000\n\n        We set hi=500000 for both binary searches.\n\n        For the first binary search (for m=100000): we need the smallest n with f(n)>=100000.\n\n        We know that n=400000: \n            f(400000) = 400000//5 + 400000//25 + 400000//125 + 400000//625 + 400000//3125 + 400000//15625 + 400000//78125 + 400000//390625\n            = 80000 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 100000-1? Let me compute:\n\n            400000//5 = 80000\n            400000//25 = 16000\n            400000//125 = 3200\n            400000//625 = 640\n            400000//3125 = 128\n            400000//15625 = 25\n            400000//78125 = 5\n            400000//390625 = 1\n            Sum = 80000+16000=96000; 96000+3200=99200; 99200+640=99840; 99840+128=99968; 99968+25=99993; 99993+5=99998; 99998+1=99999.\n\n            So 400000 gives 99999. Then 400001 to 400004: same as 400000. Then 400005: adds one (because 400005//5=80001, but then we have to recalc all? Actually, we can't simply add one.\n\n            Actually, the function f(n) is computed by the standard method.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note: the next multiple of 5 is 400005, which adds 1 (since 400005 is divisible by 5 once). Then 400005//5 = 80001, and then 400005//25 = 16000 (same as 400000//25 because 400000//25=16000, and 400005//25=16000.2 -> floor division is 16000). Then 400005//125=3200, etc. So the total becomes 80001 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 99999 + (80001-80000) + (the rest same) -> 99999+1=100000.\n\n            So L for m=100000 is 400005.\n\n            Then we need to compute R for m+1=100001: the smallest n such that f(n)>=100001.\n\n            Then we continue until we get R.\n\n            Then we check f(L)==100000? Yes, so then we output the numbers from 400005 to R-1.\n\n            But note: the numbers from 400005 to R-1 are consecutive, and the count is R - 400005.\n\n            However, we don't know R without computing.\n\n        But the point is: our hi=500000 is sufficient because 400005 < 500000.\n\n        Similarly, for m=100000, the next jump (to 100001) might occur at 400010 (if we only add 5, then we add one more 5, so 400010//5=80002, then 400010//25=16000 (same), then 400010//125=3200, etc. -> then the total is 80002+16000+... = 100000+ (80002-80001) = 100000+1? Actually, 400005 already gave 100000, then 400006: same, 400007: same, 400008: same, 400009: same, 400010: same because 400010//5=80002, but then 80002-80001=1, and then 400010//25: 400010//25 = 16000 (same as 400000//25) -> so total 100000+1=100001.\n\n            Actually, wait: \n\n                f(400005) = 100000\n                f(400010) = 400010//5 + 400010//25 + 400010//125 + ... \n                         = 80002 (from 400010//5) + 16000 (from 400010//25) + ... -> same as 400000's calculation but with an extra 1 in the 5's part.\n\n            But actually, 400010 is divisible by 5 once (so adds one) and also by 2, but that doesn't matter. So yes, 400010 gives 100000 + 1 = 100001? \n\n            However, note: 400005: \n                400005//5 = 80001, and then 400005//25=16000 (because 400005//25=16000.2 -> floor to 16000). Then 80001+16000=96001, then plus 400005//125=3200 -> 99201, then 400005//625=640 -> 99841, then 400005//3125=128 -> 99969, then 400005//15625=25 -> 99994, then 400005//78125=5 -> 99999, then 400005//390625=1 -> 100000.\n\n            Then 400010: \n                400010//5=80002, then 400010//25=16000 (because 400010//25=16000.4 -> floor to 16000), then 80002+16000=96002, then 400010//125=3200 -> 99202, then 400010//625=640 -> 99842, then 400010//3125=128 -> 99970, then 400010//15625=25 -> 99995, then 400010//78125=5 -> 100000, then 400010//390625=1 -> 100001.\n\n            So R (for m+1=100001) is 400010.\n\n            Then the numbers with exactly 100000 zeros are from 400005 to 400009 (inclusive). That's 5 numbers.\n\n        So the output for m=100000 would be:\n\n            5\n            400005 400006 400007 400008 400009\n\n        But wait, let me check 400005 to 400009: \n            Each step from 400005 to 400009 adds one factor of 2, but no factor of 5? Actually, 400005 is divisible by 5 (so we count one 5) and then 400006,400007,400008,400009 are not divisible by 5. Then 400010 is divisible by 5 (so we count one 5 again). \n\n        However, the trailing zeros are determined by the total factors of 5. \n\n        In 400005: we have one 5 (from 400005) and the rest numbers from 1 to 400004 already have 99999 zeros. Then adding 400005 gives one more 5, so total 100000.\n\n        Then 400006: we multiply by 400006,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values for a given \\( m \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the function \\( f(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we use binary search to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( f(L) \\geq m \\) and the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( f(R) \\geq m+1 \\). These bounds help us identify the range of \\( n \\) values where \\( f(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Checking Validity of Bounds**: If \\( f(L) \\) is not equal to \\( m \\), it means there are no integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values lie between \\( L \\) and \\( R-1 \\), inclusive.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: The result is the count of integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\). If there are no such integers, the output is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    m_val = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def f(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    lo, hi = 0, 500000\n    \n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if f(mid) >= m_val:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n            \n    L = lo\n    \n    if f(L) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    lo2, hi2 = 0, 500000\n    while lo2 < hi2:\n        mid2 = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        if f(mid2) >= m_val + 1:\n            hi2 = mid2\n        else:\n            lo2 = mid2 + 1\n            \n    R = lo2\n    k = R - L\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        numbers = list(range(L, R))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function \\( f(n) \\)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for \\( L \\)**: The binary search starts with a range from 0 to 500,000. It finds the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) where \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). This \\( L \\) is the lower bound of our target range.\n\n3. **Check for Valid \\( L \\)**: If \\( f(L) \\) does not equal \\( m \\), it means no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition, and the output is 0.\n\n4. **Binary Search for \\( R \\)**: Another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) where \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The upper bound for valid \\( n \\) values is \\( R-1 \\).\n\n5. **Output**: The count of valid \\( n \\) values is \\( R - L \\). If there are any valid values, they are printed in increasing order from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible range of \\( n \\) values using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
