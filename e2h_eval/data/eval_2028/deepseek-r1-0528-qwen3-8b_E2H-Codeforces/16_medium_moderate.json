Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border (of nonzero length). \n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing one or more roads. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n We start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (but note: moving from one block to another requires crossing a contiguous segment of a road, so actually we can only cross one road at a time? But wait: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks must be separated by exactly one road (because if they were separated by two or more, then they would have a common border only if they are adjacent across one of the roads). \n\n But note: the movement condition is that the common border has nonzero length. This implies that we are allowed to cross multiple roads in one step? Actually, no: because if two blocks are separated by two roads, then they don't share a common border (the border between them is actually the intersection of two roads, which is a single point, so the common border has zero length). \n\n Therefore, we can only cross one road at a time. So each step moves us from a block to an adjacent block by crossing one road.\n\n Now, how do we model the problem?\n\n We can consider that the home and university are in two different regions. The entire plane is divided by n lines. We can assign a binary value to each road: whether the home is on one side and the university is on the opposite side. Then, crossing a road flips the side for that road.\n\n But note: two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road? Actually, yes: two regions are separated by a single road. The set of roads that separate a region can be represented by the side of each road (e.g., the home is in a region where for road i, we have a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i < 0, and the university is in a region where for some roads the inequality is flipped).\n\n However, the problem is: we start at home and we wish to get to university. Each step we cross one road (and flip the side for that road). The goal is the minimum number of steps.\n\n But note: the step doesn't necessarily correspond to flipping one road arbitrarily. We can only move to an adjacent block (which differs by exactly one road). Therefore, the minimum number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university (i.e., the roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides). Why?\n\n Because to get from home to university, we must cross every road that separates them. And each step we cross one road (so we need to cross each separating road at least once). Moreover, we cannot avoid crossing a separating road: so the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, wait: is it that simple? Consider: what if we cross a road that does not separate the two points? Then we might end up in a region that is not helpful. But note: we are allowed to take any path. However, we must cross every separating road at least once, and we can only change regions by crossing one road at a time.\n\n But here's the catch: the minimal steps is the minimal number of road crossings required to go from home to university. Since each crossing changes the side for one road, and the two points are separated by k roads (meaning that for k roads the two points are on opposite sides), then we must cross each of these k roads an odd number of times (at least once) and the other roads an even number of times (preferably zero). \n\n However, note: we are allowed to cross a road multiple times, but we don't want to. The minimal path would only cross the necessary roads (each separating road exactly once). But what about the non-separating roads? We don't need to cross them. \n\n But wait: is it always k steps? Let me think with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   These two lines are the x-axis (y=0) and the y-axis (x=0). The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant. The university (-1,-1) is in the third quadrant.\n\n   The roads separate the two quadrants. How many roads separate them? Both roads: \n        For the line x=0 (a=1, b=0, c=0): \n            at home (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\n            at university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite.\n\n        For the line y=0 (a=0, b=1, c=0):\n            home: 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 > 0.\n            university: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite.\n\n   So both roads separate the two points. Then the minimal steps should be 2.\n\n   Example output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   The third road: x+y-3=0. Check separation for this road:\n        home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 < 0.\n        university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 < 0 -> same side.\n\n   So only two roads separate the two points. Output: 2.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the number of roads for which the home and the university are on opposite sides.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n 2. Read n.\n 3. For each road (a, b, c):\n        Compute d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Compute d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        Note: We need to check the sign. However, the equation is a*x+b*y+c=0. The side of a point is determined by the sign of (a*x+b*y+c). But note: the definition of the side is arbitrary. We only care whether the signs are opposite.\n\n        However, caution: if d1 is positive and d2 is negative, they are opposite. Similarly, if d1 is negative and d2 is positive, they are opposite. But what if one is zero? The problem states that neither home nor university lies on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero.\n\n        But note: the equation defines the road. The sign of d1 and d2 must be compared.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the road equation can be multiplied by -1 and still represent the same line. But that doesn't matter because then d1 and d2 would both flip sign. But we are only comparing the sign between d1 and d2.\n\n        So, we can do:\n\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n            count++\n\n 4. Print the count.\n\n But wait: why is the answer the count? Because each separating road must be crossed at least once, and we can arrange the path so that we cross each separating road exactly once (and never cross a non-separating road). Thus, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: two separating roads -> 2 steps. Correct.\n\n Example 2: two separating roads -> 2 steps. Correct.\n\n But wait, what if there is a road that is separating, but we cross it twice? Then we would have taken two steps for that road, but that is not minimal. However, our reasoning is that we must cross each separating road at least once, and we can do it without extra crossings.\n\n However, note: the problem says that we can move from one block to another if they share a common border (nonzero length). This is equivalent to crossing one road. So the graph is built such that two regions are connected by an edge if they differ by exactly one road. Then the minimal path from home to university is the Hamming distance between the two binary strings (each road's side) which is the number of differing bits (i.e., the number of separating roads). \n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the count.\n\n However, wait: what if the home and university are separated by a road, but also by another road, and there is a possibility to cross both in one step? No, because one step only crosses one road. So we must cross one road at a time.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n But wait: what if the home and university are already in the same block? Then the number of separating roads is 0, so we output 0.\n\n Let me test with the example: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        1 1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Then for both roads:\n        Road1: 0*1+1*1+0 = 1, then same for university: 1 -> same side.\n        Road2: 1*1+0*1+0 = 1, same for university: 1 -> same side.\n\n   So count=0, output 0.\n\n Another test: same home and university, but one separating road? Then we output 1.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   count = 0\n   for each road (a, b, c):\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 >= 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 <= 0):\n            Actually, since the points are not on the road, we know d1 and d2 are nonzero. So we can use:\n\n        if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n But note: the condition (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0) is equivalent to (d1*d2 < 0) because if d1 and d2 have opposite signs then product is negative.\n\n However, caution: overflow? The numbers can be as large as 10^6, and we are multiplying a, b, c by x1, y1 (also up to 10^6). So the maximum absolute value of d1 can be up to 10^12. But Python integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem. But we are using comparisons, so we don't need to worry about the actual value, just the sign.\n\n However, note: if the line equation is given with large coefficients, the product might be very large. But again, we are only comparing the sign, so we can use:\n\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:   # but wait, what if one of them is zero? The problem says they are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero. However, the multiplication might be expensive for big numbers? But n is at most 300, so 300 multiplications of two 10^12 numbers (which is 60-bit integers) is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n\n But note: what if d1 is negative and d2 is positive? Then opposite. Similarly for positive and negative.\n\n However, the multiplication method is simpler and avoids the two conditions.\n\n But wait: if d1 is negative and d2 is positive, then d1*d2 is negative. Similarly, if d1 is positive and d2 is negative, then d1*d2 is negative. So we can use:\n\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n However, one more thing: the sign of the product depends on the signs. But note: if the road equation is multiplied by -1, then the entire equation becomes negative, but then d1 and d2 become negative of what they were. However, the product d1*d2 remains the same (because both flip). So it doesn't matter.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? It doesn't affect the product because the product of two negatives is positive. Actually, wait: no. If we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the original d1 and d2 become -d1 and -d2. Then the product becomes (-d1)*(-d2) = d1*d2, which is the same. So the condition is invariant.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if we use the multiplication, we are computing two big numbers and then multiplying. But the problem says the inputs can be as large as 10^6, so the products are up to 10^18, which is acceptable for Python in terms of magnitude, but note: the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates are integers, so we are safe.\n\n But there's an alternative: we can avoid the multiplication and compare the signs directly. However, the multiplication is straightforward.\n\n However, there is a caveat: what if d1 and d2 are very close to zero but not zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so they are not zero. But we don't need to worry about floating point because we are using integers.\n\n But wait: the input is integer, so d1 and d2 are integers. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the product might be negative zero? No, because integers in Python don't have negative zero.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: there is a possibility of overflow in terms of time? 300 iterations, each doing two multiplications (for d1 and d2) and then one multiplication for the product? Actually, we can compute d1 and d2 and then check the product. Alternatively, we can check without the product:\n\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n\n This is two comparisons per road. We do 300 * 2 comparisons, which is acceptable.\n\n However, the product method is one multiplication per road (three multiplications: a*x1, b*y1, then add c; same for d2) and then one multiplication for d1*d2. That's four multiplications per road (actually, two multiplications for d1: two multiplies and an add; similarly for d2, then one multiply for d1*d2). The direct sign comparison uses two comparisons (but we compute d1 and d2 anyway). \n\n But note: we have to compute d1 and d2 anyway, so we can store them and then compare.\n\n I'll use:\n\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n Or more concisely:\n\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n Since the product is negative if and only if they have opposite signs.\n\n However, we must be cautious for the case when d1 or d2 is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined such that the entire equation is zero? The problem says ai and bi are not both zero, and the points are not on the road. So d1 and d2 are nonzero.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, d1 and d2 are nonzero.\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait, let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Road1: (0,1,0) -> d1 = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1, d2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product = -1 -> count+=1\n        Road2: (1,0,0) -> d1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1, d2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product=-1 -> count+=1 -> total 2.\n\n Example 2:\n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Road3: (1,1,-3) -> d1 = 1*1+1*1-3 = 1+1-3 = -1, d2 = 1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3 = -1-1-3=-5 -> product = (-1)*(-5)=5 -> not negative, so not counted.\n\n Therefore, output 2.\n\n But wait, the example input 2 provided was:\n\n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Our code outputs 2, which matches.\n\n However, wait: the example input was given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        And the expected output is ['2','2'].\n\n But wait, the second example input has three roads, and the third road does not separate the two points, so we count 2, which is correct.\n\n One more test: same point.\n\n        Input:\n            0 0\n            0 0\n            1\n            1 0 0\n\n        Then d1 = 1*0+0*0+0 = 0 -> but wait, the problem says the points are not on the road. So we assume the input will not give a road that passes through (0,0) if the point is (0,0). But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\" So we don't have to handle the case of d1=0.\n\n But note: the problem says the points are not on the road, so we are safe.\n\n However, the above code works for the provided examples.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined with negative values? \n\n Example: \n        Road: (-1, 0, 0) for the x-axis. Then for home (1,1): d1 = -1*1+0*1+0 = -1, for university (-1,-1): d2 = -1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = 1 -> product = -1 -> counts.\n\n But the same as the positive version. So it's consistent.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\"\n\n And we are counting the number of roads that separate the two points. Is that really the minimal steps?\n\n Explanation: Each step moves you from one block to an adjacent block (crossing one road). To get from the home block to the university block, you must cross each separating road at least once. Moreover, you can plan a route that crosses each separating road exactly once (and never crosses a non-separating road). Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But note: what if the separating roads are not independent? For example, two roads that are parallel? Then the blocks are arranged in a grid, and to get from one block to the other you must cross each separating road once. So the minimal steps is still the count.\n\n Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the input might have negative numbers for the coordinates and the coefficients, but our arithmetic handles that.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read home and university coordinates.\n   Read n.\n   For i in range(n):\n        read a, b, c\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0: count++\n\n   Print count.\n\n But wait: the example input format is:\n\n        First line: two integers (x1, y1)\n        Second line: two integers (x2, y2)\n        Third line: integer n\n        Then n lines, each with three integers (a, b, c)\n\n We must read from stdin.\n\n Example input:\n\n        \"1 1\"\n        \"-1 -1\"\n        \"2\"\n        \"0 1 0\"\n        \"1 0 0\"\n\n However, note: the example input string is given as a list of strings, but in the actual input we read from stdin, so we split by space.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 3: same point, no roads separating -> 0.\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          1 1\n          0\n\n        But wait, n>=1, so minimum n=1. Let me do with one road that doesn't separate:\n\n          1 1\n          1 1\n          1\n          1 0 0   # the road x=0. Then for (1,1): d1=1, for (1,1): d2=1 -> same side -> count 0.\n\n        Output: 0.\n\n Example 4: same point, but the road separates? Actually, if the road passes through the point, the problem guarantees the point is not on the road. So we don't need to worry.\n\n Example 5: two roads, one separates, the other does not.\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          1 1\n          2\n          1 0 0   # x=0 -> same side: both 1 (if we use a=1,b=0,c=0) then d1=1, d2=1 -> not separating.\n          0 1 0   # y=0 -> same side: both 1 -> not separating.\n\n        Output: 0.\n\n Example 6: two roads, both separate.\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n All good.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says the roads divide the plane. The minimal steps is the number of separating roads. \n\n But wait: what if we cross a road twice? Then we end up in the same side. But the minimal path doesn't require that. We only need to cross the separating ones. \n\n So the answer is indeed the count.\n\n Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the product overflows to a negative due to being too large? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow. But the product might be a very large negative? No, the sign is what matters.\n\n However, one more thing: the product d1*d2 might be negative even if the signs are opposite, and positive if same. But what if one of the numbers is negative and the other positive, but the product is positive? No, the product is negative if one positive and one negative.\n\n So the condition holds.\n\n But wait: what if d1 is negative and d2 is positive? Then product is negative. Correct.\n\n What if d1 is positive and d2 is negative? Then product is negative. Correct.\n\n Therefore, we are done.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says that the roads are defined by aix+biy+ci=0, and we are using the same equation to compute d1 and d2. This is correct.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n But wait: there is a possibility that the equation is defined with a different normalization. But the problem does not specify the normalization, and we are just evaluating the expression. The sign of d1 and d2 relative to each other is independent of the normalization (since if we multiply the entire equation by a positive constant, the signs don't change; if we multiply by a negative constant, the signs of both d1 and d2 flip, but then the product remains the same). However, note: the equation is linear and homogeneous in the coefficients. The condition for separation is purely the sign.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is normalized differently? For example, if the road is given by 2x+3y+4=0, then the same road could be given by -2x-3y-4=0. Then d1 becomes negative of what it was. But then d1*d2 remains the same. So the condition holds.\n\n Therefore, the solution is robust.\n\n We output the code.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says that the roads are distinct, but that doesn't affect our calculation.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait, the input might have negative numbers and the splitting by space should handle that.\n\n Alternatively, we can read the next line and split.\n\n But the problem says the next n lines contain 3 space-separated integers.\n\n Let me test with negative numbers:\n\n        Input: \n            -1 -1\n            -1 -1\n            1\n            -1 0 0\n\n        Then d1 = -1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = 1, d2 = same -> product 1 -> not negative.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another: \n            Home: (1,1) and University: (-1,-1)\n            Road: (-1,0,0) -> d1 = -1*1 +0+0 = -1, d2 = -1*(-1)=1 -> product = -1 -> count++.\n\n        Correct.\n\n I think we are good.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates are integers. So we are safe.\n\n Let me run the code on the sample inputs.\n\n Sample 1:\n\n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Sample 2:\n\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n But wait, the sample input 2 in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        and the output is 2.\n\n However, the example input format in the problem statement also includes:\n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        and the example input is given as a string.\n\n        But our program reads from stdin.\n\n        We are good.\n\n I think we can submit.\n\n But wait: what if the product d1*d2 is too large and causes an overflow in other languages? But the problem says the inputs are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of d1 and d2 is about 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. Then the product is up to (2e12)^2 = 4e24, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but the operation is O(1) for fixed size, but 4e24 is a number with about 78 bits, which is acceptable in Python). However, in C++ we might have to worry about long long (which is 64 bits, so up to 9e18). But the problem says the inputs are integers and the constraints are up to 10^6, so the product is up to (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6) * same for the other point, but wait: no, d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and |a|,|b|,|c|,|x1|,|y1| are all <= 10^6, so the maximum absolute value for d1 is |a*x1| <= 10^12, then adding b*y1 (another 10^12) and c (10^6) so maximum absolute value is 2e12+1e6, which is about 2e12. Then the product is (2e12)*(2e12)=4e24, which is 4 followed by 24 zeros. In C++ this would be 4000000000000000000000000, which is beyond long long (which is typically 64 bits, about 9e18). But the problem is for Python, so we are safe.\n\n Since the problem says we are writing a Python script, we don't worry.\n\n Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each step corresponds to crossing one road, and the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are infinite lines that divide the plane into regions (blocks). The home and university are located in two different blocks. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border of nonzero length, which means crossing exactly one road at a time.\n2. **Insight**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, this road must be crossed at least once during the journey. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these values differ, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\( n \\) roads (up to 300), the solution efficiently handles the input constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    n = int(input())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, defined by coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the equation \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\), the code calculates the value of this equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the product of these two values is negative, it indicates that the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. Such roads are counted.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home by crossing each separating road exactly once.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties and simple arithmetic checks to solve the problem within the given constraints.",
