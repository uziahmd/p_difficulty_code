Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Concatenate the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) to form the expected letters.\n 2. Check that the length of the concatenated string is equal to the length of the third string (the pile).\n 3. Count the frequency of each letter in the concatenated string and compare with the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip newlines.\n - Combine the first two strings: `combined = guest_name + host_name`\n - If the sorted list of combined string is equal to the sorted list of the pile string, then print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined string: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   But note: the example output says YES, but wait: the example input has a third string that is the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Actually, let's check the example: \n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 11 letters\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n        Total: 19 letters.\n\n        Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> Let's count: \n            S: appears 2? \n            A: appears 2?\n            N: appears 1?\n            T: appears 1?\n            M: appears 1?\n            O: appears 2?\n            R: appears 1?\n            Z: appears 1?\n            D: appears 2?\n            E: appears 2?\n            L: appears 1?\n            C: appears 1?\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as a single string for the example? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n        So the first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", second line is \"DEDMOROZ\", third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n        Now, if we combine the first two: \n            SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\n        But the third string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n        However, note that the example output is 'YES'. \n\n        Let me count the letters in the combined string (without spaces, just uppercase letters):\n\n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ:\n        S: 2 (from SANTA and the last S in CLAUS? Actually: \n            S: 2 (first S in SANTA, and the S in CLAUS)\n            A: 2 (from SANTA and CLAUS)\n            N: 2 (from SANTA and CLAUS)\n            T: 1 (from SANTA)\n            C: 1 (from CLAUS)\n            L: 1 (from CLAUS)\n            U: 1 (from CLAUS)\n            D: 2 (from DEDMOROZ: two D's)\n            E: 1 (from DEDMOROZ: one E? Actually, wait: DEDMOROZ -> D,E,D,M,O,R,O,Z -> so E:1)\n            M: 1 (from DEDMOROZ)\n            O: 2 (from DEDMOROZ: two O's)\n\n        Now, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        Let's break it down: \n            S: 2 (SANTA and S at the end)\n            A: 2 (in SANTA and in CLAUS)\n            N: 2 (in SANTA and in CLAUS)\n            T: 1 (in SANTA)\n            M: 2 (one in SANTA and one in MOROZ)\n            O: 3 (two in MOROZ and one in CLAUS? Wait, no: CLAUS doesn't have an O. Actually, the string is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n                SANTA -> has one O? Actually, no: SANTA has no O, but then MOROZ has two O's and then CLAUS has no O? So total O: 2?\n            Let me write: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n            S: 2\n            A: 2\n            N: 2\n            T: 1\n            M: 2 (from SANTA and MOROZ)\n            O: 2 (from MOROZ: two O's)\n            R: 1 (from MOROZ)\n            Z: ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the lengths of the combined names and the pile must be equal, and the frequency of each letter in the combined names must match the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Concatenate the Names**: Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n2. **Check Lengths**: If the length of the concatenated string does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\" because there are either missing or extra letters.\n3. **Frequency Comparison**: For each letter in the concatenated string, count its occurrences and compare it with the count of the same letter in the pile. If all counts match, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the quantity and type of letters required to form the original names from the given pile.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest_name + host_name\n    \n    if len(combined) != len(pile_letters):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    for char in set(combined):\n        if combined.count(char) != pile_letters.count(char):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n3. **Length Check**: The code checks if the length of the combined string matches the length of the pile. If not, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Frequency Check**: For each unique character in the combined string, the code counts its occurrences in both the combined string and the pile. If any character's count differs between the two, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If all checks pass, the code prints \"YES\", indicating that the pile can be rearranged to form the original names without any extra or missing letters.\n\nThis method ensures that both the quantity and exact match of letters are verified, providing an efficient and clear solution to the problem.",
