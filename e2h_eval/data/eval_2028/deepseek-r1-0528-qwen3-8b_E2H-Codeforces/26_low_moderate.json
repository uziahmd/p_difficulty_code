Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three variables with ranges. The total number of triples is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1) which can be very large (up to about 500000^3) so we cannot iterate.\n\n We need to count the triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, but note that x and y have fixed ranges.\n\n However, note that the condition is x+y>z, and we know:\n   x_min = A, x_max = B\n   y_min = B, y_max = C\n\n So for a fixed z (which must be at least C and at most D), the condition becomes:\n   x+y > z.\n\n Since x>=A, y>=B, we must have at least A+B. If A+B <= z, then even the smallest x and y don't form a triangle? Then for this z, there would be no triangles.\n\n But note: the condition is x+y>z. So for a fixed z, we require x+y>z.\n\n How to count the pairs (x,y) for fixed z?\n   x from A to B, y from B to C, and we need x+y>z.\n\n This is similar to counting pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, which is equivalent to counting pairs (x,y) that do not satisfy x+y<=z and then subtract from the total pairs.\n\n However, the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). \n\n Alternatively, we can count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z and subtract from the total.\n\n But note: the ranges are independent and the condition is linear.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z.\n\n Then the number of valid pairs for z is: total_pairs - F(z)\n\n Then the answer is: Sum_{z=C}^{D} [ (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z) ] ?\n\n But wait: actually, the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) and we subtract the pairs that do not satisfy x+y>z (i.e., the pairs that satisfy x+y<=z). \n\n However, note: the condition for a triangle is x+y>z, so we want to remove the pairs that do not form a triangle (x+y<=z). Therefore, the count for a fixed z is: \n   count_z = (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y>z)\n\n Then total triangles = sum_{z=C}^{D} count_z.\n\n Now, how to compute F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z?\n\n Conditions: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\n We can fix x, then y must be <= min(C, z-x) and also y>=B. So for a fixed x, the number of y is:\n   y_low = B, y_high = min(C, z-x)\n   Then if y_low <= y_high, the count for x is: max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) but note: if z-x < B, then no y.\n\n Alternatively, we can use two pointers or precomputation.\n\n But note: z goes from C to D (which can be up to 500000) and for each z we would iterate over x from A to B (which is up to 500000) and that would be O(n^2) and too slow.\n\n We need to compute F(z) faster.\n\n Let's reframe: \n   F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} [ number of y in [B, C] such that y <= min(C, z-x) ]\n\n But note: we can break the condition on y: y must be at least B and at most min(C, z-x).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight is recognizing that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), such that \\(x + y > z\\). Directly iterating over all possible triples is infeasible due to the large constraints (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\) for each variable).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This can be rephrased as counting pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\) and subtracting this from the total number of valid pairs.\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: \n   - **Total Pairs**: The total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) is \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).\n   - **Invalid Pairs**: For each \\(z\\), count the pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\). This involves summing over all \\(x\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) the number of \\(y\\) values from \\(B\\) to \\(\\min(C, z - x)\\).\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the number of invalid pairs for each \\(z\\). Precompute the cumulative counts for \\(y\\) values to allow quick range queries, reducing the complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n    \n    arr = [0] * (D + 2)\n    for y_val in range(B, C + 1):\n        arr[y_val] = 1\n        \n    prefix = [0] * (D + 2)\n    for i in range(1, D + 2):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i]\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_bound = z - B\n        if low_bound < A:\n            count_invalid = 0\n        else:\n            left = A\n            right = min(B - 1, low_bound)\n            if right < left:\n                count_invalid = 0\n            else:\n                count_invalid = prefix[right] - prefix[left - 1]\n                \n        count_z = total_pairs - count_invalid\n        ans += count_z\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) is computed as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).\n\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: An array `arr` marks the valid \\(y\\) values (from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\)) with 1s, and a prefix sum array `prefix` is built to quickly compute the number of valid \\(y\\) values up to any given point.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Triples**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), the number of invalid pairs \\((x, y)\\) (where \\(x + y \\leq z\\)) is found using the prefix sum array. The valid pairs for each \\(z\\) are then the total pairs minus the invalid pairs, and these are summed up to get the final answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid triangles by leveraging prefix sums to reduce the complexity, making it feasible for large input sizes.",
