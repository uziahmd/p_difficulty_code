Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the old candles to make more new ones. So:\n\n   Step 1: Use all the new candles (a) to burn for 'a' hours. Then we get 'a' old candles.\n   Then, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the old ones, and we will have a % b old candles left.\n\n   But then we also have the new candles we just made, which when burned will become old candles.\n\n   Actually, we can combine the process:\n\n   Let's denote:\n     total = a   (total candles we have, initially all new)\n     hours = 0\n\n   However, note that we don't necessarily have to burn all the new ones at once? But the problem says we act optimally.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We can burn them and then recycle the leftovers.\n\n   Steps:\n     total_hours = 0\n     current_candles = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, we can simulate:\n\n     while current_candles >= 1:\n        total_hours += current_candles   # because we can burn each candle for an hour\n        # Now, we have current_candles old candles (from the ones we just burned) plus any leftover?\n        # But note: we might have some leftover from previous cycles.\n\n        # Actually, we need to keep track of the total number of candles (both new and recycled) we have.\n\n        # Instead, we can do:\n\n        # We start with 'a' new candles. Then we use them and get 'a' old candles.\n        # Then we can convert some of the old candles to new ones.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use a mathematical approach:\n\n        # Let n be the initial number of candles.\n        # Each time we burn n candles, we get n hours and n old candles, which can be converted into k = floor(n / b) new candles, and we leave r = n % b old candles.\n\n        # Then we have k new candles to burn, and we will have r + k (because the k new candles when burned become old) but wait: actually, the next cycle we have the leftover from the previous conversion (r) and the k new candles we just made.\n\n        # However, note: we can consider the entire process until we don't have enough old candles to make a new one.\n\n        # But there is a simpler way:\n\n        # total_hours = 0\n        # candles = a\n        # while candles >= b:\n        #   hours_in_this_round = candles // b * b   ? Not exactly.\n\n        # Actually, we can break down:\n\n        #   total_hours += candles   # because we burn all the candles we have (which are available) for one hour each.\n        #   Then, we get candles old candles, so we can make new_candles = candles // b\n        #   And then the remaining old candles are candles % b.\n\n        # But note: after burning, we have the old candles and the new_candles we just made (which are not burned yet). Actually, the burning process uses the current candles (which are either new or recycled) and then we get old candles from those burns.\n\n        # However, we can combine the leftover from the previous cycle with the new ones we made.\n\n        # But wait, the process is:\n\n        #   We have a certain number of candles (let x). We burn all of them (so we get x hours) and then we get x old candles.\n        #   Then we can form y = x // b new candles, and we have z = x % b old candles left.\n        #   Then we set x for the next round to y (the new candles) and we keep the z old candles.\n\n        # However, note that the new candles we made from the old ones are not burned until the next round.\n\n        # So:\n\n        #   total_hours += x\n        #   Then, we set x = (x // b) + (x % b)  ??? \n\n        # Actually, no. The x in the next round is the new candles (which we can burn) and we still have the leftover old candles (x % b) that we haven't used.\n\n        # But wait, the problem allows us to use the leftover old candles in the next rounds.\n\n        # Example: \"4 2\" -> \n        #   Start: x = 4, total_hours=0\n        #   Round 1: burn 4 -> total_hours=4, then we get 4 old candles. Then we make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and leftover 0. Then next round we have 2 new candles (and 0 old ones).\n        #   Round 2: burn 2 -> total_hours=6, then we get 2 old candles. Then we make 2//2 = 1 new candle, leftover 0. Then next round we have 1 new candle.\n        #   Round 3: burn 1 -> total_hours=7, then we get 1 old candle. Since 1 < 2, we stop.\n\n        # But wait, how did we account for the old candles? In round 2, we started with 2 new candles (which were made from old) and then burned them, giving 2 old candles. Then we made 1 new candle from the 2 old candles (using 2 old candles) and then we have 0 leftover from the conversion. Then in round 3, we only have 1 new candle (the one we made) and then we burn that, and then we have 1 old candle which isn't enough to make a new one.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can simulate by keeping two variables: current_new and leftover_old.\n\n        # But note: the problem says we can use the old candles (from previous burns) to make new ones. So the total available candles at any time is the sum of new candles we have and the leftover old candles?\n\n        # Actually, we can model:\n\n        #   Let total_candles = a   (all are new initially)\n        #   hours = 0\n        #   while total_candles >= b:\n        #       # Burn as many as we have (which are all new or recycled) for one hour per candle\n        #       hours += total_candles\n        #       # Now, we have total_candles old candles (from the burned ones) and we can make new_candles = total_candles // b\n        #       new_candles = total_candles // b\n        #       leftover = total_candles % b\n        #       total_candles = new_candles   # because the new_candles are the only ones we can use again (they are not burned yet) and we leave the leftover to be carried over?\n        #       # But wait, we have leftover old candles that we haven't used. So we should add them to the new_candles? Actually, no: because the new_candles are made from the old ones, and we are going to use the leftover separately.\n\n        #   However, note that the leftover is still old candles that we can use in the next round. So we need to keep track of the leftover.\n\n        # Revised:\n\n        #   Let current = a   (this includes both new and old? Actually, initially we have a new candles and 0 old)\n        #   But the process: we burn the current candles (whether they are new or old) and then we get current old candles.\n\n        #   Then, from the current old candles, we can make floor(current / b) new candles, and the leftover is current % b.\n\n        #   Then the next round we have: (floor(current / b)) new candles and (current % b) old candles. But the next round we can only burn the new candles we made? Or can we mix?\n\n        #   Actually, the problem does not distinguish between new and old candles. Once burned, they become old. And we can only use old candles to make new ones. But note: the new candles we make are just candles that can be burned. So we can burn them and then they become old.\n\n        #   Therefore, the state is the total number of candles (both new and old) we have? Actually, no: because we can only use old candles to make new ones, but we can burn any candle (new or old) and then it becomes old.\n\n        #   However, we are allowed to burn any candle. So the key is: we want to maximize the number of hours.\n\n        #   The optimal strategy: burn all candles we have (both new and old) at the same time? Actually, we can burn one candle per hour, but we can burn multiple candles consecutively. However, the problem does not require burning one at a time, so we can burn as many as we have in one go? Actually, the problem says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" — meaning one candle per hour? Or does he light multiple? The problem says: \"for how many hours\".\n\n        #   Let me read the example: Input \"4 2\" gives output \"7\". How?\n        #       - He starts with 4 candles. He burns 4 candles for 4 hours. Then he has 4 old candles, which makes 2 new candles (since 4/2=2). Then he burns these 2 for 2 hours. Then he gets 2 old candles, which makes 1 new candle (since 2/2=1). Then he burns that 1 for 1 hour. Then he gets 1 old candle and cannot make a new one. Total hours = 4+2+1 = 7.\n\n        #   So we burn all candles we have at the same time (in a batch) and then we get the old candles from that batch.\n\n        #   Therefore, we can model:\n\n        #       hours = 0\n        #       current = a\n        #       leftover = 0\n\n        #   But wait, we don't separate new and old? Actually, the process:\n\n        #       We start with a new candles (no leftover).\n        #       Then, we burn the current total of candles (which is a) and get a old candles.\n        #       Then, we use the old candles to make new ones: new_candles = a // b, and leftover_old = a % b.\n        #       Then, we set current = new_candles (because these are the candles we have now, and they are new) and we keep the leftover_old for the next cycle.\n\n        #       Then, in the next cycle, we burn the current candles (which is new_candles) and get new_candles old candles. Then we combine the leftover_old and the new_candles old candles? Actually, no: the leftover_old is already old, and the new_candles we just burned become old. Then we have a total of (leftover_old + new_candles) old candles.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can think of having:\n\n        #       total_old = 0\n        #       current_new = a\n\n        #       Then, while current_new > 0 or total_old >= b:\n        #           # But we can also burn the old ones if we don't have new ones? Actually, we can burn any candle.\n\n        #   However, the problem does not specify that we must burn new candles first. We can burn old ones too. But note: the process of making new candles requires old ones. So we have two types: we have new candles and old candles.\n\n        #   Actually, the problem says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\". So we can use the old ones (any old ones) to make new ones.\n\n        #   We can burn any candle (whether it was originally new or made from old) and then it becomes old.\n\n        #   Therefore, the total number of candles we have (that are burnable) is the sum of new candles and the ones we made from old? Actually, no: because the ones we made from old are new candles (until burned).\n\n        #   But wait, the process:\n\n        #       We have a set of candles. Some are new, some are old (recycled). However, we can burn any candle (without restriction) and then it becomes old.\n\n        #   So we can model the entire system by the total number of candles (ignoring their origin) and the number of old candles we have.\n\n        #   However, note: to make a new candle, we need b old candles. The old candles come from burning candles. And burning a candle gives one old candle.\n\n        #   Let's define:\n        #       total_candles = (new candles) + (old candles)   -> but wait, we don't store old candles separately? Actually, we can have two states: \n        #       Let n = number of new candles (not burned yet)\n        #       Let o = number of old candles (burned and waiting to be recycled)\n\n        #   But note: the problem says we can use the old candles to make new ones. So we can convert o into new ones: floor(o / b) * (1 new candle) and the remainder o % b remains.\n\n        #   Then, we can burn any candle (either new or old). But burning a candle (whether new or old) gives one old candle. \n\n        #   However, we are free to choose which ones to burn. To maximize the hours, we want to burn as many as possible. But note: burning a new candle gives one old candle, and burning an old candle also gives one old candle. But if we burn an old candle, we lose one old candle and gain one old candle (so net zero) and we don't use the old candles to make new ones until we burn them? Actually, no: we can use the old candles at any time to make new ones.\n\n        #   Actually, the optimal strategy is to burn all the candles we have (both new and old) because:\n\n        #       Burning a new candle: we get one hour and one old candle.\n        #       Burning an old candle: we get one hour and one old candle (but we lose one old candle and gain one, so net zero change in old candles) but we use one old candle to burn and then get one back.\n\n        #   However, we can use the old candles to make new ones, and then burn those new ones. So we want to use the old candles to make as many new ones as possible, and then burn everything.\n\n        #   But note: if we burn an old candle, we are essentially not using it to make a new candle. So we should use as many old candles as possible to make new ones, and then burn the new ones and the remaining old ones.\n\n        #   Actually, the process:\n\n        #       Step 1: Use old candles to make new ones. Then we have:\n        #           new_candles = floor(old_candles / b)\n        #           remaining_old = old_candles % b\n        #       Then, we have the original new candles (if any) and the new_candles we just made.\n\n        #       Then, we burn all the candles (new candles + old_candles_remaining) for one hour per candle, and then we get (new_candles + old_candles_remaining) old candles.\n\n        #       Then, update old_candles for the next round: the total old candles becomes remaining_old (from the previous step) + (new_candles + old_candles_remaining) [from burning].\n\n        #   However, wait: we just used some old candles to make new ones, so we have remaining_old. Then we burn all the candles (the new ones and the remaining_old is not included because we didn't burn them? Actually, no: the remaining_old are still there and we can burn them too.\n\n        #   But note: the problem doesn't require that we must use the old candles only for recycling. We can burn any candle.\n\n        #   However, the optimal way is to use the old candles to make new ones first (to get more candles to burn) and then burn everything.\n\n        #   So:\n\n        #       Let n = new candles (initially a, then the ones made from old)\n        #       Let o = old candles (initially 0)\n\n        #       While n > 0 or o >= b:\n        #           # First, convert as many old candles as possible to new ones.\n        #           if o >= b:\n        #               new_from_old = o // b\n        #               o = o % b\n        #               n += new_from_old\n\n        #           # Then, burn as many candles as we have (n + o) because we can burn both new and old.\n        #           # But wait: if we burn an old candle, we are effectively not increasing the total old candles (we lose one and gain one). However, we are going to use the old candles for recycling, so we should burn the new ones first? Actually, no: we can burn any.\n\n        #           Actually, we are allowed to burn any candle. The goal is to maximize the total hours.\n\n        #           How many hours can we get from this round? We can burn (n + o) candles, each giving one hour.\n\n        #           Then, we get (n + o) old candles (because each candle burned becomes one old candle).\n\n        #           Then, we set n = 0   (because we burned all the new and old) and o = (n + o) [which is the old candles from this round]?\n\n        #           But wait, we just used the old candles to make new ones (if any) and then burned everything. Then the old candles for the next round is the entire (n + o) from the burning.\n\n        #           However, note: we are using the old candles (from before the burning) to make new ones, so we reduce o by the amount used (o - b*(new_from_old)) and then we have the remainder. Then we burn everything (n and the remainder) and then we get (n + remainder) old candles.\n\n        #           So:\n\n        #               Step 1: Convert old candles to new: \n        #                   new_candles = o // b\n        #                   o = o % b\n        #                   n += new_candles\n\n        #               Step 2: Burn all candles: n + o\n        #                   hours += (n + o)\n        #                   Then, the old candles for the next round is (n + o)   [because we burned everything]\n\n        #           Then set n = 0 (since we burned all the candles) and o = (n + o) from step 2.\n\n        #   But wait, in the next round, we start with o = (n + o) from the previous burning, and n=0.\n\n        #   However, let's test with the example \"4 2\":\n\n        #       Initially: n=4, o=0\n        #       Round 1:\n        #           Step1: o=0 -> no conversion, then Step2: burn 4 -> hours=4, then o becomes 4 (because we burned 4 candles and got 4 old candles). n becomes 0.\n        #       Round 2:\n        #           Step1: o=4, convert: 4//2=2, so n becomes 2, o becomes 0.\n        #           Step2: burn 2 -> hours=4+2=6, then o becomes 2 (from burning 2 candles).\n        #       Round 3:\n        #           Step1: o=2, convert: 2//2=1, so n becomes 1, o becomes 0.\n        #           Step2: burn 1 -> hours=6+1=7, then o becomes 1.\n        #       Round 4: \n        #           Step1: o=1, no conversion (1<2), then Step2: burn 1 -> hours=8, then o becomes 1 -> then we break? But wait, after burning we have 1 old candle, and then we would do Step1 again (since o=1>=b? no) and then Step2: burn 1 -> then we get 1 old candle again. This would continue forever.\n\n        #   But note: we break when n==0 and o < b. However, we are burning even if we have less than b old candles? \n\n        #   Actually, the condition for the loop is: while n>0 OR o>=b? Actually, we want to burn as long as we have candles (n>0 or o>0). But note: we can burn even if we don't have enough to make a new candle.\n\n        #   However, the problem says: we can use the old candles to make new ones only when we have at least b. Then we burn all the candles we have (both new and old) regardless of the old count.\n\n        #   But wait, the above simulation with the example:\n\n        #       We burned the last candle (the one from the third round) and then we had 1 old candle. Then we try to burn that one? But we can burn it, because we have one candle. Then we get one hour and one old candle. Then we can burn that again and again.\n\n        #   However, the example output is 7, meaning we stop after 7 hours. \n\n        #   Let me read the example again: \n        #       \"Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\"\n\n        #   So why did we get 8 in the above simulation?\n\n        #   The issue: in the example, after burning the first four candles, we get four old candles. Then we make two new candles from four old ones. Then we burn the two new candles (so two more hours, total 6). Then we get two old candles. Then we make one new candle from two old ones. Then we burn the one new candle (one more hour, total 7). Then we have one old candle (from the burned one) and we cannot make a new candle (since 1<2). \n\n        #   But in our simulation, after burning the two candles (round 2) we get two old candles, and then we use those two to make one new candle (so n=1, o=0). Then we burn the one new candle (so we get one hour and one old candle). Then we have one old candle and no new candles. Then we try to convert: 1 old candle -> no conversion. Then we burn the one old candle (if we do) and get one hour and one old candle. Then we can convert again? No, because we need b (which is 2) to make a new one.\n\n        #   But wait, the problem does not say we cannot burn old candles. It says we can use b old candles to make a new one. So we can burn old candles, but burning an old candle doesn't help in making new ones (unless we have at least b). However, we are allowed to burn old candles arbitrarily.\n\n        #   The example output is 7, so we stop at 7. Why did we get 8 in the simulation?\n\n        #   The problem statement: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" — does this imply that we can only light new candles? Or can we light any candle?\n\n        #   Let me re-read: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" — but then it says \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\". There is no restriction that we must light only new candles.\n\n        #   However, the example explanation: \n        #       \"For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out, Vasily can make another candle.\"\n\n        #   This suggests that the burning process is done in batches: first the initial a, then the ones made from the old ones from the initial batch, and then the ones made from the next batch.\n\n        #   But note: after the second batch (the two candles) are burned, we get two old candles and then we make one new candle. Then we burn that one. Then we have one old candle. The example stops at 7.\n\n        #   Why can't we burn the old candle (the one we have) in the next hour? Because the example says \"Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\".\n\n        #   The problem says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\", meaning that we can only use the went out candles (the old ones) to make new ones. But burning an old candle produces an old candle (so it doesn't help in making a new one unless we have at least b). However, burning an old candle is still allowed and counts as one hour.\n\n        #   But wait, the example does not say that we burned the last old candle. It says we burned the two candles (which were new) and then made one new candle and burned that. Then we have one old candle. Then the example stops.\n\n        #   However, according to the problem, we can burn that one old candle for one more hour. Then we get one more hour and one more old candle. Then we have two old candles, which we can use to make one new candle, and then burn that for one hour, and so on.\n\n        #   But that would lead to an infinite series? \n\n        #   Actually, we must consider: we can burn the old candles arbitrarily. But the problem asks for the maximum number of hours.\n\n        #   However, the example output is 7. So what is happening?\n\n        #   Let me check the example provided: Input ['4 2', '6 3'] -> Output ['7', '8']\n\n        #   For the second example: \"6 3\"\n        #       Start with 6 new candles.\n        #       Burn 6 -> 6 hours, then 6 old candles -> 6//3=2 new candles, leftover 0.\n        #       Burn 2 -> 2 hours, then 2 old candles -> 2//3=0, so we have 2 old candles and 0 new.\n        #       Then we can burn the 2 old candles -> 2 hours, then we have 2 old candles again (so we can do it again: 2 hours, then 2 old candles, etc.) -> infinite?\n\n        #   But the expected output is 8.\n\n        #   Alternatively, the example might be stopping when we don't have enough to make a new candle AND we don't have any candles to burn? \n\n        #   Let me recalc for \"6 3\":\n        #       Hour 1-6: burn 6 candles -> 6 hours, then we have 6 old candles -> make 2 new candles (since 6//3=2) and leftover 0.\n        #       Hour 7-8: burn the 2 new candles -> 2 hours, then we have 2 old candles -> cannot make a new candle (2<3) and no new candles left. Then we stop at 8 hours.\n\n        #   But wait, we have 2 old candles left. Why can't we burn them? The problem does not say we cannot burn old candles. However, if we burn an old candle, we get one hour and one old candle. So:\n\n        #       After burning the 2 new candles (hours 7 and 8), we have 2 old candles.\n        #       Then we can burn one of them: hour 9, then we have 1 old candle (because we burned one and got one back? Actually, we burn one and then it becomes one old candle. So we have 1 old candle (from the burn) and the other one we didn't burn? Actually, we can burn one and then we have one old candle (from the burned one) and the other one remains? Or do we have to account for both?\n\n        #   Let me clarify: we have two old candles. We can burn one: then we use one old candle and get one hour and one old candle. So we have 1 (remaining) + 1 (from burning) = 2 old candles again. Then we burn the other: same thing. Then we have 2 old candles again. Then we can burn one, and so on.\n\n        #   But wait, the problem says: we light up a candle for an hour. We can light one candle per hour. So we can burn one candle per hour. And when we burn a candle, it goes out and becomes an old candle.\n\n        #   Therefore, we can burn the two old candles one by one. Each burn gives one hour and one old candle. So we can burn them indefinitely? \n\n        #   However, the example output is 8, meaning we stop at 8.\n\n        #   There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n        #   After reading the problem statement again: \"When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out.\" and \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\".\n\n        #   This implies that only the went out candles (the old ones) can be used to make new candles. But burning a candle (whether it was originally new or made from old) is allowed and counts as one hour. However, the act of burning a candle that was made from old ones is still allowed, and it becomes an old candle.\n\n        #   But the example output for \"6 3\" is 8, meaning they did not burn the two old candles beyond the initial two burns.\n\n        #   Let me check the sample explanation for \"6 3\": \n        #       Input: 6 3 -> Output: 8.\n\n        #   How do they get 8?\n        #       - 6 new candles: burn for 6 hours -> 6 old candles.\n        #       - From 6 old candles, we make 2 new candles (6//3=2) and we have 0 old left.\n        #       - Burn the 2 new candles: 2 hours -> total 8 hours.\n        #       - Then we have 2 old candles (from the two burned ones). But the problem doesn't say we stop here. \n\n        #   However, the example output is 8. So perhaps the problem does not allow burning old candles? \n\n        #   Let me read the problem statement: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" — so maybe we can only light new candles? \n\n        #   But then how do we use the old candles? We use them to make new candles. And then we light the new ones.\n\n        #   The problem says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\" — so the new candle is made from the old ones, but then it is a new candle (so we can light it).\n\n        #   However, once we have made a new candle from old ones, we can light it. But what about the old ones that we didn't use to make the new candles? \n\n        #   In the example \"6 3\": \n        #       We have 6 old candles. We use 6 to make 2 new candles (exactly, no leftover). Then we burn the 2 new candles and get 2 old candles. Now, we cannot make a new candle from 2 old candles (since 2<3). But the problem doesn't say we can't burn the old candles. \n\n        #   But if we can only light new candles, then we cannot burn the old ones. Then the process stops at 8 hours.\n\n        #   Similarly, for \"4 2\": \n        #       We have 4 old candles -> make 2 new candles (use 4, so no leftover). Then burn the 2 new candles -> 2 hours, then we have 2 old candles. Then we make 1 new candle (using 2 old candles) and then burn that new candle -> 1 hour. Then we have 1 old candle (from the burned new candle). Then we cannot make a new candle (1<2) and we cannot burn the old candle because we can only burn new candles? Then we stop at 7 hours.\n\n        #   This matches the sample outputs.\n\n        #   Therefore, the interpretation is: we can only burn candles that are \"new\" (i.e., not made from old ones, or rather, we can only burn the candles that are currently in the pool of new candles). The old candles can only be used for recycling.\n\n        #   But wait, the problem does not explicitly say we can only burn new candles. It says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\". This might be ambiguous.\n\n        #   However, the example and the expected outputs suggest that we can only burn the candles that we have not recycled (i.e., the new ones). \n\n        #   So the process is:\n\n        #       We start with a new candles.\n        #       We can burn a new candle (each burn uses one new candle and gives one hour and one old candle).\n        #       We can use b old candles to make one new candle.\n\n        #   Therefore, we have two actions:\n\n        #       Action 1: Burn a new candle (if available). This reduces the new candles by one and increases the old candles by one.\n        #       Action 2: Recycle old candles to make new ones (if we have at least b old candles). This reduces the old candles by b and increases the new candles by one.\n\n        #   We want to maximize the total hours.\n\n        #   Note: we can interleave these actions arbitrarily.\n\n        #   However, we can use a greedy approach: we burn as many new candles as possible, and then use the old candles to make more new candles.\n\n        #   But note: if we burn a new candle, we get an old candle. Then we can use that old candle for recycling. But if we don't have enough old candles to make a new one, we just accumulate old candles.\n\n        #   Actually, we can model the entire process by:\n\n        #       Let n = a   (new candles)\n        #       Let o = 0   (old candles)\n        #       hours = 0\n\n        #       While n > 0 or o >= b:\n        #           If n > 0:\n        #               n -= 1\n        #               o += 1\n        #               hours += 1\n        #           Else if o >= b:\n        #               o -= b\n        #               n += 1\n        #               # Note: we don't get an hour from this action, because we are only recycling.\n        #           Else:\n        #               break\n\n        #   But wait, we can only burn new candles (n>0) and we can only recycle when we have at least b old candles. And we cannot burn old candles.\n\n        #   However, the problem says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\", meaning we can only light new candles. Therefore, the above simulation is correct.\n\n        #   Let's test with \"4 2\":\n\n        #       n=4, o=0, hours=0\n        #       First, we have n>0, so we burn one: n=3, o=1, hours=1.\n        #       Then, n=3>0, burn one: n=2, o=2, hours=2.\n        #       Then, n=2>0, burn one: n=1, o=3, hours=3.\n        #       Then, n=1>0, burn one: n=0, o=4, hours=4.\n        #       Now, o=4 >=2 -> recycle: o=4-2=2, n=1, and hours remains 4.\n        #       Then, n=1>0, burn one: n=0, o=3, hours=5.\n        #       Then, o=3>=2 -> recycle: o=3-2=1, n=1, hours=5.\n        #       Then, n=1>0, burn one: n=0, o=2, hours=6.\n        #       Then, o=2>=2 -> recycle: o=0, n=1, hours=6.\n        #       Then, n=1>0, burn one: n=0, o=1, hours=7.\n        #       Then, o=1 <2 and n=0 -> break.\n\n        #   Total hours=7.\n\n        #   Now test with \"6 3\":\n\n        #       n=6, o=0, hours=0\n        #       Burn 6 times: \n        #           After 1st burn: n=5, o=1, hours=1.\n        #           ... until 6th burn: n=0, o=6, hours=6.\n        #       Then, recycle: o=6 -> 6//3=2, so we do: \n        #           First recycle: o=6-3=3, n=1, hours=6.\n        #           Second recycle: o=3-3=0, n=2, hours=6.\n        #       Then, burn the two new candles:\n        #           First burn: n=1, o=1, hours=7.\n        #           Second burn: n=0, o=2, hours=8.\n        #       Then, o=2 <3 and n=0 -> break.\n\n        #   Total hours=8.\n\n        #   But wait, in the above simulation for \"6 3\", we did two recycles and then two burns.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, given that he starts with `a` new candles and can create a new candle from `b` old candles (those that have gone out after burning). The key is to simulate the process of burning candles and recycling the old ones optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero old candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: While there are new candles available, burn one new candle per hour. Each burned candle converts into one old candle.\n3. **Recycling Old Candles**: Whenever there are at least `b` old candles, convert them into new candles. Specifically, for every `b` old candles, create one new candle, reducing the old candles by `b` and increasing the new candles by one.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process stops when there are no new candles left and fewer than `b` old candles remain, as no more candles can be burned or recycled.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring that Vasily uses his candles optimally to maximize the total burning time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    new_candles = a\n    old_candles = 0\n    hours = 0\n\n    while True:\n        if new_candles > 0:\n            new_candles -= 1\n            old_candles += 1\n            hours += 1\n        elif old_candles >= b:\n            old_candles -= b\n            new_candles += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `new_candles` and `old_candles` are initialized to `a` and `0` respectively, representing the starting state with `a` new candles and no old candles.\n2. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles to burn or enough old candles to recycle.\n   - **Burning Phase**: If there are new candles, one is burned (converting it to an old candle), incrementing the hour count.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: If there are enough old candles (`>= b`), they are converted into new candles, reducing the old candles by `b` and increasing the new candles by one.\n3. **Termination**: The loop exits when no more candles can be burned or recycled, and the total hours spent burning candles is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Vasily maximizes the number of hours by always prioritizing the use of new candles first, then recycling old ones to create more new candles, thus extending the total burning time as much as possible.",
