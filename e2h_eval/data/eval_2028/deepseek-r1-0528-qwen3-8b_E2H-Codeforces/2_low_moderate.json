Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters must be the same (and the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal has the same letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters? Let's read again: \n    - The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    - Then: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n   Input 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n   Output: NO\n\n Why? Because the center cell (which is part of both diagonals) is 's'. But wait, in the example, the diagonals must be the same letter? Actually, let's break down:\n\n Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter throughout. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be composed of one letter (say 'x') and the other diagonal (anti-diagonal) must also be composed of the same or a different letter? \n\n But the example input 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n   Output: YES.\n\n In this case, the main diagonal: \n        row0: 'w' at (0,0)\n        row1: 's' at (1,1)\n        row2: 'w' at (2,2)\n   This is not the same letter! So wait, what's going on?\n\n Let me re-read the problem statement: \n    \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This means for the main diagonal: every letter must be the same, and for the anti-diagonal: every letter must be the same.\n\n But note: the example input 2:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n The main diagonal: ['w','w','w']? Actually, no: \n        row0: index0 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 'w'? But wait, the second row is \"sws\": so at index1 is 'w'? Actually, let's index properly:\n\n        Row0: [0][0] = 'w', [0][1] = 's', [0][2] = 'w'\n        Row1: [1][0] = 's', [1][1] = 'w', [1][2] = 's'\n        Row2: [2][0] = 'w', [2][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w'\n\n So the main diagonal is [ [0][0], [1][1], [2][2] ] -> ['w','w','w'] -> same letter 'w'.\n The anti-diagonal: [ [0][2], [1][1], [2][0] ] -> ['w','w','w'] -> same letter 'w'.\n\n But wait, the center is shared and is 'w'. Now, the other condition: all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n The non-diagonal squares are:\n        [0][1] = 's'\n        [1][0] = 's'\n        [1][2] = 's'\n        [2][1] = 's'\n\n All are 's', and 's' != 'w'. So it satisfies.\n\n Now, example input 3:\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n Main diagonal: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='p', [2][2]='e' -> these are not the same. So condition fails -> output 'NO'.\n\n However, the example input 1:\n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n The main diagonal: \n        [0][0] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'o'\n        [2][2] = 's'\n        [3][3] = 'o'\n        [4][4] = 'x'\n\n These are not all the same. So condition 1 fails -> output 'NO'.\n\n But wait, the example input 1 is given as output 'NO' and our analysis matches.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the two diagonals to be the same letter? It says:\n    \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n It does not say that the two diagonals must have the same letter. They can be different",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are:\n1. All letters on both diagonals must be the same.\n2.
