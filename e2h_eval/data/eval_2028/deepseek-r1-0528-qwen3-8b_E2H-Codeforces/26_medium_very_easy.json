    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three variables with ranges. The total number of triples without the triangle condition is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1). However, not all satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n We know that for a triangle with sides x<=y<=z, the necessary and sufficient condition is x+y>z.\n\n Since our variables are constrained to intervals, we can try to count the triples that satisfy x+y>z.\n\n However, the ranges can be up to 500000, so we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix y and z, then count the x's that satisfy x >= max(A, z+1-y) and x<=min(B, y+z-1) [because x+y>z => x>=z-y+1, but note: x must be at least A and at most B].\n\n But note: the condition is x+y>z, which is equivalent to x > z-y. Since x is integer, x >= floor(z-y)+1 = z-y+1 (if z-y is not integer, but here integers) so x>=max(A, z-y+1) and x<=B, and also note that x must be at least A and at most B.\n\n However, we must also note that x must be <= B and at least A, and also from the triangle condition, we require x>z-y. \n\n But wait: we are given that x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So y>=B and z>=C, and x<=B. Therefore, note that x is bounded by [A,B] and y by [B,C] and z by [C,D]. \n\n However, the condition x+y>z must hold. Since x<=B and y<=C, and z>=C, we must have that the minimum x+y is A+B (if we take the smallest x and y) and the maximum z is D.\n\n But note: the condition might not hold for all triples. \n\n How to count without iterating over all y and z? \n\n We can use two pointers or precomputation with cumulative sums.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over y and z and use a formula for the range of x. But note: the ranges for y and z are [B, C] and [C, D] respectively, and the length of y is (C-B+1) and z is (D-C+1). The product can be up to 250e9 (if both are 500000) which is too many to iterate.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Let me reframe:\n\n Condition: x+y>z, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D].\n\n We can fix y and z, then the condition becomes x > z-y. So we require x >= max(A, floor(z-y)+1) and x <= B.\n\n The number of x for fixed y,z is:\n   L = max(A, z-y+1)\n   Then if L <= B, the count is B - L + 1, else 0.\n\n Then the total is sum_{y=B}^{C} sum_{z=C}^{D} [ B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1 ] for the case when max(A, z-y+1) <= B, else 0.\n\n But note: the inner loop over z for fixed y would be from z=C to z=D, and then we have to check for each z. The outer loop is (C-B+1) and the inner (D-C+1), so worst-case about (C-B+1)*(D-C+1) which is (500000)^2 = 250e9, too slow.\n\n We need to optimize the double summation.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix y and then consider the condition on z: For fixed y, we require z < x+y. But x is at most B, so the condition becomes z < B+y (since x<=B, then x+y <= B+y). However, we also have z>=C and z<=D. Moreover, the condition is actually z < x+y, but x can vary from A to B. So the condition must hold for the chosen x, but note we are counting the pairs (x,y,z) and we are fixing y and then z must be less than some value that depends on x. \n\n Another idea: fix y and then consider the constraint on z: For a fixed y, we require that z < x+y. But note x is variable too. However, we can think: for a fixed y, what is the maximum z allowed? It must be less than the maximum x+y. But x can be as large as B, so the condition for z is z < B+y. However, we cannot ignore the lower bound on x: the minimal x is A, so the condition for z must hold for the chosen x, but we are counting all x in [A, B] that satisfy x>y-z? Actually, no: the condition is x+y>z. \n\n Actually, for fixed y and z, we count the x's that are in [max(A, z-y+1), B]. \n\n But we can change the order: fix y and z, but then we want to avoid iterating over every z for every y.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix z and y, and then use the fact that the condition x+y>z is independent for each (x,y). But the ranges are large.\n\n Let me try to fix y first. For fixed y, we require that z < x+y. But note: x is at least A, so the minimal x+y is A+y, and the maximal x+y is B+y. Therefore, for fixed y, the condition on z is: z must be in [C, min(D, floor(B+y-1))] and also z < x+y. But note: x is variable, so the condition must hold for the chosen x. However, we are counting the x's that are >= (z-y+1) (if that is above A) and then the rest.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the condition by considering the minimal x required: x >= max(A, z-y+1). \n\n But note: the condition is x+y>z -> x>=z-y+1.\n\n Now, if we fix y, then the condition on z is: for a given z, we require z-y+1 <= B (so that there exists an x that satisfies x>=z-y+1 and x<=B). But note, even if z-y+1 <= B, we also require that z-y+1 <= B, and then the number of x is (B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1).\n\n However, we can also consider: for fixed y, the condition on z is: z < x+y for some x in [A, B]. Actually, for a fixed y, the condition on z is that z must be less than (some x+y) and the smallest x+y is A+y, so if z >= A+y, then we need to ensure that there exists an x (at least one) such that x+y>z. The largest x+y is B+y, so we require z < B+y. But also, note that even if z is very small, we can always choose an x (as long as x+y>z). However, the condition is automatically satisfied for small z because x+y can be as low as A+y, but if z is less than A+y, then we can choose any x (since even the smallest x+y is A+y > z). \n\n Actually, let me split the condition for fixed y:\n\n   Condition: x+y>z.\n\n   Since x>=A, we have x+y>=A+y. So if z < A+y, then for every x in [A, B] we have x+y>=A+y>z, so the condition holds for all x.\n\n   If z >= A+y, then we require x>=z-y+1. And note that x must be at most B, so we require that z-y+1 <= B, i.e., z <= B+y-1.\n\n   Also, note that if z >= A+y and z <= B+y-1, then the condition holds for x from max(A, z-y+1) to B.\n\n But note: we also have the constraint that z is at least C and at most D.\n\n So for fixed y, we can break the z range [C, D] into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: z from C to min(D, A+y-1) -> then every x in [A, B] works. The count for these z is (min(D, A+y-1) - C + 1) * (B - A + 1)\n\n   Part 2: z from max(C, A+y) to min(D, B+y-1) -> then the x must be from max(A, z-y+1) to B. The count for these z is for each z: (B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1)\n\n However, note: if A+y-1 < C, then part 1 is empty.\n\n Similarly, if B+y-1 < C, then part 2 is empty.\n\n So the total for fixed y is:\n\n   Let L1 = C, R1 = min(D, A+y-1)\n   Let L2 = max(C, A+y), R2 = min(D, B+y-1)\n\n   Then total for y = \n        (if L1 <= R1) then (R1 - L1 + 1) * (B - A + 1)\n        plus\n        (if L2 <= R2) then for each z in [L2, R2] we add (B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1)\n\n But note: the second part must be computed without iterating over each z.\n\n How to compute the second part quickly?\n\n For fixed y, we have to compute:\n   S(y) = sum_{z = L2}^{R2} [ B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1 ]\n\n Let T = z-y+1. Then z = T+y-1, and T runs from (L2-y+1) to (R2-y+1).\n\n Then the term becomes: B - max(A, T) + 1.\n\n But note: T = z-y+1, and we know that in this range, z>=A+y (because L2 = max(C, A+y)) so T>=A+y-y+1 = A+1? Actually, T_min = L2-y+1, and since L2>=A+y, then T_min>= (A+y)-y+1 = A+1. And A is at least 1, so T_min>=2. But wait, we defined L2 = max(C, A+y). So T_min = max(C, A+y) - y + 1.\n\n However, note that we have two cases for T: \n   Case 1: T <= A? Actually, we have T_min = max(C, A+y) - y + 1. Since A+y >= y (because A>=1) and C>=B (and B>=A) and y>=B, so A+y>=y, and then T_min = max(C, A+y) - y + 1 >= (max(C, A+y) - y + 1) and since max(C, A+y) >= y (because A>=1 and C>=B>=y? Actually, note: y is in [B, C] and C>=B, so y<=C. But A+y >= y (since A>=1). So max(C, A+y) is at least y. Then T_min = max(C, A+y) - y + 1 >= 1.\n\n But note: we must compare T with A. In the expression: max(A, T). \n\n However, note that T = z-y+1, and z>=A+y (from the definition of L2) so T>=A+1. And A+1 > A (if A>=1). So for all z in [L2, R2], T>=A+1, which is greater than A. Therefore, max(A, T)=T.\n\n So the term simplifies to: B - T + 1 = B - (z-y+1) + 1 = B - z + y.\n\n Therefore, for the second part, for fixed y and z in [L2, R2]:\n        term = B - z + y\n\n Then the second part becomes: \n        sum_{z=L2}^{R2} (B + y - z)\n\n This is an arithmetic series.\n\n Let n2 = R2 - L2 + 1\n Then the sum = n2*(B+y)*n2/2 - (sum of z from L2 to R2) ?\n\n Actually, we can compute:\n\n        sum_{z=L2}^{R2} (B+y-z) = (B+y)*n2 - (L2 + R2)*n2/2\n\n But wait: the sum of consecutive integers from L2 to R2 is (L2+R2)*n2/2.\n\n So the second part for fixed y is:\n\n        part1 = (if R1>=L1) (R1-L1+1)*(B-A+1)\n        part2 = (if R2>=L2) [ (B+y)*(R2-L2+1) - (L2+R2)*(R2-L2+1)//2 ]\n\n Then total for y = part1 + part2.\n\n Then we sum over y from B to C.\n\n However, note: the condition for part1: we require that z < A+y, i.e., z <= A+y-1. But note: A+y-1 might be less than C (so part1 is empty) or between C and D.\n\n But wait: we defined L1 = C, R1 = min(D, A+y-1). So if A+y-1 < C, then R1 = A+y-1 < C, so part1 is empty.\n\n Similarly, for part2: we require z>=A+y and z<=min(D, B+y-1). So if A+y > D, then part2 is empty.\n\n Steps:\n\n   total_triangles = 0\n   for y from B to C:\n        # Part 1: z from C to min(D, A+y-1)\n        L1 = C\n        R1 = min(D, A+y-1)\n        if L1 <= R1:\n            count_z1 = R1 - L1 + 1\n            count_x1 = B - A + 1\n            total_triangles += count_z1 * count_x1\n\n        # Part 2: z from max(C, A+y) to min(D, B+y-1)\n        L2 = max(C, A+y)\n        R2 = min(D, B+y-1)\n        if L2 <= R2:\n            n2 = R2 - L2 + 1\n            # Sum_{z=L2}^{R2} (B+y-z) = (B+y)*n2 - (sum of z from L2 to R2)\n            sum_z = (L2 + R2) * n2 // 2\n            part2 = (B+y)*n2 - sum_z\n            total_triangles += part2\n\n   Print total_triangles\n\n But note: the condition for part1: z < A+y is the same as z <= A+y-1, and for part2: z>=A+y and z<=B+y-1. These two parts together cover all z from C to D? \n\n Actually, the entire z-range is [C, D]. We split it at z = A+y-1 (so part1: z < A+y) and part2: z>=A+y and z<=B+y-1. What if z > B+y-1? Then we don't count those z. \n\n But note: the condition for the triangle requires x+y>z. The maximal x+y is B+y, so if z>=B+y, then no x (even the largest x=B) satisfies x+y>z (because B+y<=z). So indeed, for z>B+y-1 (i.e., z>=B+y) we don't have any x satisfying the condition.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of z from C to D is covered by the two parts and the rest (z>B+y-1) is not included (which is correct).\n\n However, note: the condition for part1 is only for z < A+y, and then part2 is for A+y<=z<=B+y-1. This covers all z from C to min(D, B+y-1). And note that if D is less than A+y, then part1 covers from C to D (if D>=C) and part2 is empty.\n\n Example: input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n   y from 2 to 3.\n\n   y=2:\n        Part1: L1=3, R1=min(4, 1+2-1)=min(4,2)=2 -> no part1.\n        Part2: L2 = max(3, 1+2)=max(3,3)=3, R2=min(4,2+2-1)=min(4,3)=3.\n            n2=1\n            sum_z = (3+3)*1//2 = 3\n            part2 = (2+2)*1 - 3 = 4-3 = 1.\n\n   y=3:\n        Part1: L1=3, R1=min(4,1+3-1)=min(4,3)=3.\n            count_z1 = 3-3+1=1\n            count_x1 = 2-1+1=2\n            part1 = 1*2=2.\n        Part2: L2=max(3,1+3)=max(3,4)=4, R2=min(4,3+3-1)=min(4,5)=4.\n            n2=1\n            sum_z=(4+4)*1//2=4\n            part2 = (3+3)*1 - 4 = 6-4=2.\n\n        Total for y=3: 2+2=4.\n\n   Then overall: y=2 gives 1, y=3 gives 4, so total 5.\n\n But the example output is 4.\n\n Why 5? Let's list the triangles:\n\n   (x,y,z): \n      y=2: z=3 -> x must be > 3-2=1 -> x>=2. x in [2,2] (only x=2). So (2,2,3) -> valid.\n      y=3: \n          part1: z=3 -> x can be 1 or 2 -> (1,3,3) and (2,3,3) -> two triangles.\n          part2: z=4 -> x must be >4-3=1 -> x>=2. So x=2 -> (2,3,4) -> one triangle.\n\n   So we have 1 (from y=2) + 2 (from y=3 part1) + 1 (from y=3 part2) = 4.\n\n   Our calculation for y=2: 1, for y=3: 2+2=4 -> total 5.\n\n   Where did the extra one come from?\n\n   In y=3, part2: we calculated part2=2. But according to the example, there should be only one triangle for (2,3,4). \n\n   Let's recalc part2 for y=3, z=4:\n\n        term = B - max(A, z-y+1) + 1 = 2 - max(1, 4-3+1) + 1 = 2 - max(1,2) + 1 = 2-2+1=1.\n\n   But in the simplified formula we used: term = B+y-z = 2+3-4 = 1. So that part is correct.\n\n   Then why did we get 2 for part2 for y=3? \n\n        We had: part2 = (B+y)*n2 - sum_z = (2+3)*1 - (4) = 5-4=1.\n\n   Wait, I see: I wrote in the code above for part2:\n\n        part2 = (B+y)*n2 - sum_z\n\n   But in the example calculation above for y=3, z=4, I did (B+y)*n2 = (2+3)*1 = 5, and sum_z=4, so 5-4=1.\n\n   So why did I write 2 earlier? Because I mistakenly wrote (B+y)*n2 as (3+3) for y=3? No, wait: B=2, y=3, so (B+y)=5, not 6.\n\n   Correction: In the example calculation above, I said for y=3: part2 = (3+3)*1 - 4 -> that was wrong because we are using B (which is 2) and y (which is 3) so B+y=5, not 6.\n\n   So the correct calculation for y=3 part2 is 1.\n\n   Then the total for y=3 is 2 (from part1) + 1 (from part2) = 3.\n\n   Then overall: y=2:1, y=3:3 -> total 4.\n\n   The mistake was in the example calculation: I wrote (3+3) but it should be (2+3). \n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the code we have:\n\n        part2 = (B+y)*n2 - sum_z\n\n   And that is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for part2: we said that in the entire range [L2, R2] we have T>=A+1, so we can use the simplified formula. But note: the condition for part2 is that z>=A+y, which ensures T=z-y+1>=A+1, so T>=A+1>A. So the max(A,T)=T is valid.\n\n   But what if A is 0? The problem states A>=1, so we are safe.\n\n   Let's test the second example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\n        Input: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n        y from B to C, i.e., y=2.\n\n        Part1: L1=2, R1=min(5, 1+2-1)=min(5,2)=2.\n            count_z1 = 2-2+1=1\n            count_x1 = 2-1+1=2\n            part1 = 1*2=2.\n\n        Part2: L2 = max(2, 1+2)=3, R2=min(5,2+2-1)=min(5,3)=3.\n            n2=1\n            part2 = (2+2)*1 - (3) = 4-3=1.\n\n        Total = 2+1=3 -> matches.\n\n   Third example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\n        A=B=C=D=500000.\n\n        y from 500000 to 500000.\n\n        Part1: L1=500000, R1=min(500000, 500000+500000-1)=500000 (since 500000+500000-1=999999, but min(500000,999999)=500000)\n            count_z1 = 500000-500000+1=1\n            count_x1 = 500000-500000+1=1\n            part1=1.\n\n        Part2: L2 = max(500000, 500000+500000)=max(500000,1000000)=1000000, R2=min(500000,500000+500000-1)=500000.\n            Since 1000000>500000, part2 is 0.\n\n        Total=1.\n\n   So the code works for the examples.\n\n   However, note: the condition for part2: we require z<=B+y-1. In the third example, B+y-1=500000+500000-1=999999, but D=500000, so R2=min(500000,999999)=500000, and L2=1000000, so no overlap.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   total = 0\n   for y in range(B, C+1):\n        # Part1: z from C to min(D, A+y-1)\n        low_z1 = C\n        high_z1 = min(D, A+y-1)\n        if low_z1 <= high_z1:\n            count_z1 = high_z1 - low_z1 + 1\n            count_x1 = B - A + 1\n            total += count_z1 * count_x1\n\n        # Part2: z from max(C, A+y) to min(D, B+y-1)\n        low_z2 = max(C, A+y)\n        high_z2 = min(D, B+y-1)\n        if low_z2 <= high_z2:\n            n2 = high_z2 - low_z2 + 1\n            # Sum of consecutive integers from low_z2 to high_z2\n            sum_z = (low_z2 + high_z2) * n2 // 2\n            part2 = (B + y) * n2 - sum_z\n            total += part2\n\n   print(total)\n\n But note: the range for y is from B to C, and the ranges for A,B,C,D are up to 500000, so the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the arithmetic operations are O(1) per iteration, so the entire algorithm is O(C-B+1) which is at most 500000.\n\n Let me run the first example again with the code:\n\n   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n   y=2: \n        Part1: low_z1=3, high_z1=min(4,1+2-1)=min(4,2)=2 -> no part1.\n        Part2: low_z2 = max(3,1+2)=3, high_z2=min(4,2+2-1)=min(4,3)=3.\n            n2=1, sum_z=(3+3)*1//2=3, part2=(2+2)*1-3=4-3=1.\n\n   y=3:\n        Part1: low_z1=3, high_z1=min(4,1+3-1)=min(4,3)=3.\n            count_z1=1, count_x1=2, so 1*2=2.\n        Part2: low_z2 = max(3,1+3)=4, high_z2=min(4,2+3-1)=min(4,4)=4.\n            n2=1, sum_z=4, part2=(2+3)*1-4=5-4=1.\n\n        total = 0 (for y=2) + 2+1 = 3 -> wait, but we expected 4.\n\n   Wait, for y=3, part2: \n        Condition: z>=A+y=4, and z<=min(D, B+y-1)=min(4,4)=4 -> z=4.\n        Then the condition for x: x>=max(A,4-3+1)=max(1,2)=2, and x<=B=2 -> x=2. So one triangle.\n\n        But our part2 calculation: (B+y)*n2 - sum_z = (2+3)*1 - 4 = 5-4=1, which is correct.\n\n        Then part1: for y=3, z=3: condition is x+y>3 -> x+3>3 -> x>0, and x>=1, so all x from 1 to 2 work -> 2 triangles.\n\n        Then total for y=3 is 2+1=3.\n\n        And for y=2: 1, so overall 4.\n\n        But wait, the code for y=2: part2 gives 1, and for y=3: part1 gives 2 and part2 gives 1 -> total 1+3=4.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n   However, in the above step-by-step for y=3, the part1 was 2 and part2 was 1, so 3 for y=3, and y=2 gives 1, so 4.\n\n   The mistake in my previous calculation was that I thought the code for y=3 part1 was 2 and then part2 was 1, so 3, and then y=2 was 1, so 4.\n\n   But wait, in the code above for the first example, when y=3, part1 is 2 and part2 is 1, so that's 3. Then we add the 1 from y=2, so 4.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   total = 0\n   for y in range(B, C+1):\n        # Part1: z from C to min(D, A+y-1)\n        high_z1 = min(D, A+y-1)\n        if high_z1 >= C:\n            count_z1 = high_z1 - C + 1\n            count_x1 = B - A + 1\n            total += count_z1 * count_x1\n\n        # Part2: z from max(C, A+y) to min(D, B+y-1)\n        low_z2 = max(C, A+y)\n        high_z2 = min(D, B+y-1)\n        if low_z2 <= high_z2:\n            n2 = high_z2 - low_z2 + 1\n            sum_z = (low_z2 + high_z2) * n2 // 2\n            part2 = (B + y) * n2 - sum_z\n            total += part2\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But note: the condition for part1 is high_z1>=C (we defined low_z1=C). So we can write:\n\n        if high_z1 >= C:\n\n   However, we can also write:\n\n        low_z1 = C\n        high_z1 = min(D, A+y-1)\n        if low_z1 <= high_z1:\n\n   Which is the same.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the constraints say A<=B<=C<=D, and y from B to C.\n\n   We assume the input is given as four integers.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: '1 2 3 4' -> 4\n   Example2: '1 2 2 5' -> 3\n   Example3: '500000 500000 500000 500000' -> 1\n\n   This should be efficient because the loop runs (C-B+1) times, which is at most 500000.\n\n   However, note: if C-B+1 is large (like 500000) then the loop runs 500000 times, which is acceptable in Python if we do simple arithmetic in each iteration.\n\n   Let me test with the maximum values: A=1, B=1, C=500000, D=500000. Then the loop runs 500000 times, and each time we do a few arithmetic operations. This should be acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the worst-case is when the range for y is [B, C] and C-B+1 can be up to 500000, and we do a constant-time operation per y. 500000 iterations is acceptable in Python.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example input format: the first line contains four integers.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   One more thing: the condition for part2 uses the fact that T>=A+1, so we can simplify the term. But we already proved that, so we are good.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: Use integer arithmetic.\n\n   Example: when y=500000, and A=1, then A+y=500001, and then part2: low_z2 = max(C, 500001) = 500001, but if C=500000 then low_z2=500001, and D=500000, so high_z2=min(500000, B+y-1)=min(500000, 500000+500000-1)=500000, so no part2.\n\n   But if we have A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then y=500000, and part1: high_z1=min(500000, 1+500000-1)=500000, so part1: (500000-500000+1)*(500000-1+1)=1*500000=500000.\n\n   Then part2: low_z2 = max(500000,500001)=500001, high_z2=min(500000,500000+500000-1)=500000 -> no part2.\n\n   So total=500000.\n\n   But wait, what are the triangles? \n        x in [1,500000], y=500000, z=500000.\n        Condition: x+500000>500000 -> x>0, which is always true. So indeed, there are 500000 triangles.\n\n   The example input \"1 500000 500000 500000\" should output 500000.\n\n   Let me check: \n        A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\n        y=500000 (only one y)\n        Part1: high_z1=min(500000, 1+500000-1)=500000, so count_z1=500000-500000+1=1, count_x1=500000-1+1=500000, so part1=1*500000=500000.\n        Part2: none.\n\n        Output: 500000.\n\n   That seems correct.\n\n   But wait: the condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. Here, y=500000, and z=500000, and x from 1 to 500000. But note: we require B<=y and y<=C, and here B=500000, C=500000, so y=500000 is okay. And z=500000 is okay. And x from 1 to 500000.\n\n   The triangle condition: x+y>z -> x+500000>500000 -> x>0, which is true for all x>=1.\n\n   So 500000 triangles.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"non-degenerate triangles\", and the condition is the vertices are not collinear.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we optimize by leveraging mathematical insights and efficient computation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the necessary and sufficient condition for non-degeneracy is \\(x + y > z\\). Given the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we can break down the problem into manageable parts by fixing \\(y\\) and then determining valid \\(z\\) values, and subsequently counting valid \\(x\\) values for each combination.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each fixed \\(y\\), the condition \\(x + y > z\\) can be split into two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: \\(z < A + y\\). Here, all \\(x\\) values in the range \\([A, B]\\) satisfy the condition because even the smallest \\(x\\) (i.e., \\(A\\)) ensures \\(x + y > z\\).\n   - **Case 2**: \\(z \\geq A + y\\). Here, \\(x\\) must be at least \\(z - y + 1\\) to satisfy \\(x + y > z\\). The number of valid \\(x\\) values is derived from the range \\([max(A, z - y + 1), B]\\).\n\n3. **Efficiency**: By iterating over each \\(y\\) in \\([B, C]\\), we compute the valid \\(z\\) ranges and corresponding \\(x\\) counts efficiently. The solution avoids nested loops by using arithmetic series summation for the second case, reducing the complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(C - B + 1)\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    \n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        # Part 1: z from C to min(D, A + y - 1)\n        high_z1 = min(D, A + y - 1)\n        if high_z1 >= C:\n            count_z1 = high_z1 - C + 1\n            count_x1 = B - A + 1\n            total_triangles += count_z1 * count_x1\n            \n        # Part 2: z from max(C, A + y) to min(D, B + y - 1)\n        low_z2 = max(C, A + y)\n        high_z2 = min(D, B + y - 1)\n        if low_z2 <= high_z2:\n            n2 = high_z2 - low_z2 + 1\n            sum_z = (low_z2 + high_z2) * n2 // 2\n            part2 = (B + y) * n2 - sum_z\n            total_triangles += part2\n            \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_triangles` is initialized to zero to accumulate the count of valid triangles.\n3. **Loop Over \\(y\\)**: For each \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\):\n   - **Part 1**: Counts all \\(z\\) values from \\(C\\) to the minimum of \\(D\\) and \\(A + y - 1\\). For each such \\(z\\), all \\(x\\) values in \\([A, B]\\) are valid, contributing \\(count_z1 \\times (B - A + 1)\\) to the total.\n   - **Part 2**: For \\(z\\) values from \\(\\max(C, A + y)\\) to \\(\\min(D, B + y - 1)\\), the valid \\(x\\) values start from \\(\\max(A, z - y + 1)\\) to \\(B\\). The number of valid \\(x\\) values for each \\(z\\) is \\(B - (z - y + 1) + 1\\), which simplifies to \\(B + y - z\\). The sum of these values over the range of \\(z\\) is computed using the arithmetic series formula.\n4. **Output**: After processing all \\(y\\) values, the total count of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by leveraging mathematical insights and arithmetic series, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
