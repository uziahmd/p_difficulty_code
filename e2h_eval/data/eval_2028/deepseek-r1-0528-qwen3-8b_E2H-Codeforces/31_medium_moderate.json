Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can assume that initially there were infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x.\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards (from the available ones) such that the total sum of all found cards is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We are allowed to use any card from -x to x (with no limit on the count, except the absolute value constraint).\n\n 3. We want to achieve a total sum of 0. So we need to add a set of cards (each between -x and x) such that their sum is -S.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of cards.\n\n Observation:\n\n Since we can choose any numbers in the range [-x, x], we can think of the problem as: \n   Represent the number (-S) as a linear combination (with nonnegative integer coefficients) of integers in [-x, x] (but note: we can use both positive and negative, so effectively we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x] arbitrarily) but we want to minimize the total number of terms.\n\n However, note that we are not limited to using only positive or only negative. But the key is: we can use any integer in the range [-x, x]. \n\n Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n We are allowed to use any card value from -x to x. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover with one card is x.\n\n Let T = -S (the target sum we need from the additional cards).\n\n We want to minimize k (number of cards) such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) with a1 + a2 + ... + ak = T.\n\n How to minimize k?\n\n Note: The problem is similar to making change with coins, but the \"coins\" here are the integers from -x to x (excluding 0? but including 0) but note: if we use 0, it doesn't change the sum. So we might avoid zeros because they don't help. However, sometimes zeros might be forced? Actually, we can ignore zeros because we are allowed to use any integer and we are minimizing the number. So we can focus on non-zero values.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use the same card multiple times (since there are infinitely many). So we have an unlimited supply of each integer from -x to x.\n\n But note: we are only concerned with the minimal k.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n - If S is already 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n\n - Otherwise, we need to achieve T = -S.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n 1. The maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x (if we take k cards each of absolute value x). So we must have |T| <= k*x.\n\n 2. However, we can also use positive and negative numbers. In fact, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers between -k*x and k*x, but with some gaps? Actually, by the coin problem, if we have coins that include consecutive integers (like we have all integers from -x to x) then we can form every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] provided that k is sufficiently large? \n\n However, note: we have coins from -x to x. This set includes 0 and symmetric around 0. Also, we have consecutive integers? Actually, we don't necessarily have consecutive integers for k=1, but for k>=1 we can form all integers in steps of 1? \n\n But wait: we have all integers from -x to x. For k=1: we can form every integer from -x to x. For k=2: we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x? Not exactly: for example, if x=2, then with two cards we can form:\n   Minimum: -2-2 = -4, maximum: 2+2=4.\n   Can we form every integer in between?\n     We have: \n        -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4?\n     Actually, yes: \n        -4: two -2's.\n        -3: -2 and -1, or -1 and -2.\n        -2: two -1's or one -2.\n        etc.\n\n Why? Because the set of integers from -x to x includes all integers in that interval, so the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the absolute values is 1 (if x>=1). And by the coin problem, for sufficiently large |T|, we can form T with enough coins. However, we are minimizing the number of cards.\n\n Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n  - We want to minimize k. The best way to minimize k is to use as large a step as possible.\n\n  But note: we can use positive and negative. So we can also use negative steps. However, we are only concerned with the absolute value.\n\n  Actually, we can use the following:\n\n  Let d = gcd(1,2,...,x) [but since we have consecutive integers, d=1]. Then by the coin problem, for sufficiently large |T|, the minimal k is at least ceil(|T| / (x)) [if we use only positive or negative] but wait: we can mix positive and negative? \n\n  However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x]. So we can use both positive and negative to cancel out.\n\n  Actually, the problem becomes: what is the minimum k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) and their sum is T.\n\n  We can use the following known result: \n\n  The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|, and also k must be at least ceil(|T|/x) [if we use only one sign] but with mixing we can do better? \n\n  Actually, note: the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= |T|, because the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x (if we use k cards of value x or -x). But is that condition sufficient?\n\n  Consider: we need to form T. The condition k*x >= |T| is necessary.\n\n  Is it sufficient? \n\n  We can use the following lemma: Given an integer T and an integer x (>=1), we can represent T by a sum of k integers each between -x and x if and only if |T| <= k*x and k >= ceil(|T|/x) ??? \n\n  Actually, note that we can use both positive and negative. So we can adjust the sum by up to k*x in absolute value.\n\n  However, we must consider the possibility of having an odd T and even k*x? Actually, the set of representable numbers is symmetric. \n\n  But there's a catch: we can represent any integer T with |T| <= k*x, provided that k is sufficiently large. However, we must check if k is the minimal.\n\n  Example: \n    Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2]. Sum S = -4, so T=4.\n\n    We need to form 4. \n      k=1: maximum absolute value is 3 -> cannot form 4 -> fails.\n      k=2: maximum absolute value is 6, and we can form 4? \n          4 = 3+1 -> but wait, we are allowed to use 1? Yes, because 1 is in [-3,3]. So we can use two cards: 3 and 1. But wait, the example output is 2.\n\n    However, the example input was \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2.\" \n        Why two cards with number 2? Because 2+2 = 4.\n\n    So we can use two cards of 2.\n\n    So the condition is: we can form T if |T| <= k*x and k >= ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n    Actually, note: we can use at most k cards, each at most x (in absolute value). Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can represent is k*x. \n\n    Now, is every integer between -k*x and k*x representable? \n\n    Let's test for k=1: then we can represent every integer from -x to x.\n\n    For k=2: the set of representable numbers is from -2*x to 2*x. But is every integer in that range representable?\n\n        For example, x=2, k=2: \n            Range: -4 to 4.\n            Can we represent 3? \n                3 = 2+1 -> yes, because 1 is in [-2,2].\n            Similarly, -3 = -2-1.\n\n        What about x=3, k=2: \n            Can we represent 5? 5 = 3+2 -> yes, because 2 is in [-3,3].\n\n        Actually, the set of numbers we can represent with k cards is the set of integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x] if k>=1 and x>=1? \n\n        Why? Because we can use the following greedy: \n          Let y_i = a_i (each in [-x, x]). We want to form T. We can use as many positive as needed and then adjust with negatives? \n\n        Actually, the set of integers from -k*x to k*x is contiguous because we can use the fact that we have consecutive integers (or at least we have 1 and -1, so we can fill the gaps). \n\n        However, note: we have all integers from -x to x. So we have 1 and -1. Then with two cards, we can form any integer from -2*x to 2*x? \n\n        Base: k=1: [-x, x] (which is contiguous).\n\n        For k>=2: \n          We can form T by first using one card to get as close as possible and then adjust. \n\n        But actually, we can use the following: \n          We know that the set of integers we can form with k cards is the Minkowski sum of k copies of the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x}. \n\n        The Minkowski sum of two intervals [a,b] and [c,d] is [a+c, b+d]. And since our set for one card is [-x, x] (which is contiguous), then the set for k cards is [-k*x, k*x] (contiguous). \n\n        Proof by induction:\n          Base: k=1 -> [-x, x] contiguous.\n          Assume for k-1, we can form every integer from -(k-1)*x to (k-1)*x.\n          Then for k: we can form every integer from -(k-1)*x - x to (k-1)*x + x, i.e., [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        However, wait: the Minkowski sum of two sets A and B is {a+b : a in A, b in B}. \n          A = [-x, x] and B = [-(k-1)*x, (k-1)*x] (by induction) then A+B = [-x-(k-1)*x, x+(k-1)*x] = [-(k)*x, k*x]. \n\n        And since A is contiguous and B is contiguous, the sum is contiguous.\n\n        Therefore, for k cards, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n        Then the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n        But wait, what if T=0? Then k=0. But note: if T=0, then we don't need any card.\n\n        So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x) if |T| > 0.\n\n        However, let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n          n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> sum S = -1+1+2 = 2, so T = -2 (we need to add cards with sum -2).\n\n          Then k_min = ceil(|-2|/2) = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. Matches.\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n          n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> sum S = -4, so T=4.\n          k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2. Matches.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative? The absolute value takes care of that.\n\n        However, consider T=0 -> k=0.\n\n        But wait: what if the required T is 0? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal k is:\n\n          If T==0: 0\n          Else: ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        However, let's test with another example:\n\n          Suppose x=5, and T=6: then ceil(6/5)=ceil(1.2)=2.\n\n          With two cards: we can form 6? \n            Maximum per card is 5, so 5+1=6 -> yes.\n\n          Another: T=7: ceil(7/5)=ceil(1.4)=2 -> but 5+2=7 (with two cards: 5 and 2) -> yes.\n\n          But wait, what if T=3? ceil(3/5)=ceil(0.6)=1. One card: we can use 3 (if 3<=5) -> yes.\n\n        However, consider T=4: ceil(4/5)=1 -> yes.\n\n        It seems to hold.\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card -> 0.\n\n        However, note: the above formula gives ceil(|T|/x) for non-zero T. But what if T is negative? The absolute value makes it positive, so same.\n\n        But wait: is this always true? \n\n        We proved that for k cards, we can form any integer T with |T| <= k*x. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n        That is: k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        However, note: k must be an integer, and we are taking ceiling of a real number.\n\n        Example: |T|=0 -> k_min=ceil(0/x)=ceil(0)=0.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n          k_min = 0 if T==0, else ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        But wait: what if |T| is divisible by x? Then ceil(|T|/x) = |T|//x, which is an integer.\n\n        However, note: the condition is k*x >= |T|. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k >= |T|/x.\n\n        So indeed k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        But wait: consider T=5, x=5 -> k_min = ceil(5/5)=1. Correct.\n\n        T=5, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Correct, because with one card we can only go up to 3, so we need at least two cards: 3+2=5.\n\n        However, what if T=5 and x=3: we can use two cards: 3 and 2 (both in [-3,3]), so that works.\n\n        But now consider T=6 and x=3: ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if T=-5 and x=3? Then |T|=5, ceil(5/3)=2.\n\n        However, we must check: can we form -5 with two cards? \n          Each card between -3 and 3. \n          -3 + (-2) = -5 -> yes.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the problem statement says that the initial set of cards has numbers from -x to x. But note: the problem does not say that the hidden cards are from the same set? Actually, the problem says: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\"\n\n        So the available cards are from -x to x.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of cards to add is k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if |T|>0, and 0 otherwise.\n\n        But wait: let me check the example from the problem again:\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> T=-2, so |T|=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> output 1.\n\n          Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> T=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code would be:\n\n          Read n, x\n          Read list of n integers\n\n          S = sum(list)\n          T = -S\n\n          if T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Take absolute value of T\n              abs_T = abs(T)\n              # Compute k_min = ceil(abs_T / x)\n              import math\n              k_min = math.ceil(abs_T / x)\n              print(k_min)\n\n        However, wait: what if T is very large? But note: the initial cards are bounded by x (absolute value) and we have n cards (at most 1000) and x at most 1000, so the maximum |S| is at most 1000 * 1000 = 1000000, so T is at most 1000000, and x is at least 1, so k_min would be at most 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: is it always true that we can form T with k_min cards? \n\n        We argued that the set of representable numbers with k_min cards is [-k_min*x, k_min*x] and since k_min is defined as the smallest integer such that k_min*x >= |T|, then |T| <= k_min*x, so T is representable.\n\n        However, note: the representation might require the use of numbers that are not in the set? Actually, we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. And we have shown that the Minkowski sum of k_min copies of [-x, x] is [-k_min*x, k_min*x] and is contiguous. Therefore, T is in that interval.\n\n        But wait: the Minkowski sum being contiguous means that every integer between -k_min*x and k_min*x is representable. So yes.\n\n        However, let me test with T=1, x=10 -> ceil(1/10)=ceil(0.1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card, so 0.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is already zero? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n        However, note: the problem states: \"Vanya wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\". So if the found cards already sum to zero, then we don't need to add any.\n\n        So the above code should work.\n\n        BUT WAIT: there is a catch.\n\n        Consider: what if we can form T with fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards by using a mix of positive and negative? \n\n        Actually, our reasoning was that the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n        Why is that? \n\n        Because the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x (if we use k cards each of absolute value x). Therefore, we must have k*x >= |T|.\n\n        And we also showed that with k cards we can represent every integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer satisfying k*x >= |T|, which is ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        However, note: sometimes we might be able to use negative and positive to get a sum that is closer? \n\n        Example: T=5, x=3. Our calculation: ceil(5/3)=2. But can we do it with 1 card? No, because the maximum positive card is 3, so we need at least two cards.\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        Another example: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2. But can we represent 4 with two cards? \n          Maximum per card is 3, so 3+1=4 -> yes.\n\n        However, consider T=3, x=3: ceil(3/3)=1 -> one card: 3.\n\n        What if T=2, x=3: ceil(2/3)=1 -> one card: 2.\n\n        What if T=1, x=3: ceil(1/3)=1 -> one card: 1.\n\n        What if T= -1, x=3: same.\n\n        What if T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=2 -> two cards: 3+3=6.\n\n        But wait: what if T=5, x=5: ceil(5/5)=1 -> one card: 5.\n\n        What if T=5, x=4: ceil(5/4)=ceil(1.25)=2 -> two cards: 4+1=5.\n\n        What if T=5, x=2: ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> three cards: 2+2+1=5.\n\n        But wait: can we form 5 with three cards of absolute value at most 2? \n          Maximum positive is 2, so three 2's: 2+2+2=6, which is greater than 5. \n          We need 5: we can do 2+2+1 -> but 1 is allowed (since |1|<=2) -> yes.\n\n        However, is there a way with two cards? Two cards: maximum is 4, so 4 is the maximum. We cannot get 5 with two cards.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the above example T=5, x=2: k_min=3.\n\n        But wait: what if we use negative numbers? \n          We are allowed to use negative numbers. But negative numbers reduce the total sum. So if we use two cards: we can only get up to 4 (if we use two 2's). We cannot exceed 4. Similarly, we cannot get 5 with two cards.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative? The absolute value takes care.\n\n        However, wait: what if the required T is negative? \n\n        Example: T=-5, x=2 -> ceil(5/2)=3. Then we need three cards: we can use -2, -2, and 1? Wait, 1 is positive and we are trying to get -5. \n\n        Actually, we can use three negative cards: -2, -2, and -1 -> total -5.\n\n        Or we can use two negative cards: -2 and -2 gives -4, then we need -1 more, so we need a third card of -1. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use: -2, -2, -1 -> -5.\n\n        So the same.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          Read n, x\n          Read the list of n integers\n\n          S = sum(list)\n          T = -S\n\n          if T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              abs_T = abs(T)\n              k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This is equivalent to ceil(|T|/x) without floating point?\n              But wait: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b  when a and b are positive.\n\n          However, note: if |T| % x == 0, then (|T| + x - 1) // x = (|T|//x) + (x-1)//x -> but actually:\n\n          Example: |T|=5, x=2 -> (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n          But note: if |T|=4, x=2 -> (4+2-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 (in integer floor division) -> correct.\n\n          However, we can also use math.ceil if we convert to float. But the problem constraints are small (x up to 1000, |T| up to 1000000) so floating point is safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n\n        But note: if abs_T is 0, then we get (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 (for x>=1). So that works for T=0.\n\n        Actually, we can simplify:\n\n          If T==0, then we output 0.\n\n          But note: if T !=0, then we compute k_min = ceil(|T|/x). However, if T=0, then |T|=0, and ceil(0/x)=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can write without the if:\n\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   if abs_T>0, but wait: if abs_T==0 then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, and integer division truncates towards zero). \n\n        However, let's test with abs_T=0: \n          (0 + x - 1) // x = (x-1)//x -> for x=1: (0)//1 = 0; for x=2: (1)//2 = 0; for x=3: (2)//3=0. \n\n        So it returns 0 when abs_T=0.\n\n        But note: if T is negative, we take absolute value so abs_T is nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply:\n\n          abs_T = abs(-S)\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   if abs_T > 0, but wait: what if abs_T==0? Then we get 0.\n\n        However, note: the formula (abs_T + x - 1) // x is valid for positive abs_T and x>0.\n\n        But wait: what if abs_T=0? Then we want 0. And the formula gives 0.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          S = sum(found_cards)\n          T = -S\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n\n          if abs_T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # But we can use the formula for all abs_T>=0\n              k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n              print(k_min)\n\n        However, wait: is that correct for negative T? We took absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative? Then we are representing the negative T, but the same k_min is used.\n\n        However, note: the condition k_min*x >= |T| is symmetric.\n\n        But wait: the above formula (abs_T+x-1)//x is the standard way to compute the ceiling of (abs_T/x) for positive integers.\n\n        However, let me test with a few:\n\n          abs_T=1, x=2: (1+2-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> ceil(0.5)=1 -> correct.\n          abs_T=2, x=2: (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 (if using integer floor division) -> wait, 3//2 is 1 in Python, but ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: 3//2 is 1, but we want ceil(2/2)=1. So it's correct.\n\n        However, note: the formula for ceiling is: ceil(a/b) = (a-1)//b + 1   for positive a and b.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: \n          k_min = (abs_T - 1) // x + 1   if abs_T>0, but then for abs_T=0 we cannot use.\n\n        But we are handling abs_T=0 separately.\n\n        Actually, we can combine:\n\n          if abs_T == 0:\n              k_min = 0\n          else:\n              k_min = (abs_T - 1) // x + 1\n\n        Let me test:\n\n          abs_T=1: (0)//x + 1 = 0+1=1 -> correct.\n          abs_T=2: (1)//x + 1 -> if x>=2, then (1)//x=0, so 1 -> correct.\n          abs_T=3, x=2: (2)//2+1 = 1+1=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if x=3, abs_T=3: (2)//3+1 = 0+1=1 -> ceil(3/3)=1 -> correct.\n\n        So we can also use:\n\n          if abs_T == 0:\n              k_min = 0\n          else:\n              k_min = (abs_T - 1) // x + 1\n\n        Which one is better? The first one (using (abs_T+x-1)//x) works for all nonnegative abs_T including 0, but we saw that for abs_T=0, (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x which is 0 for x>=1. So we can simply:\n\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This gives the ceiling of (abs_T/x) for positive abs_T, and for 0 it gives 0.\n\n        But wait: what if x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          S = sum(cards)\n          T = -S\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n\n          # Using integer arithmetic for ceiling division for nonnegative abs_T and x>=1\n          if abs_T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Ceiling of abs_T / x\n              # k_min = ceil(abs_T / x) = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n              k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n              print(k_min)\n\n        However, wait: is there a case where (abs_T + x - 1) // x is not the ceiling? \n\n        Example: abs_T=0, x=5 -> (0+5-1)//5 = 4//5=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: abs_T=1, x=5 -> (1+5-1)//5 = 5//5=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: abs_T=5, x=5 -> (5+5-1)//5=9//5=1 -> wait, 9//5 is 1 in integer floor division? Actually, 9//5=1 (because 9//5=1.8 -> floor to 1) but we want ceil(5/5)=1. So that's correct.\n\n        But wait: ceil(5/5)=ceil(1)=1, and (5+5-1)//5 = 9//5=1 (since 9//5=1 with remainder 4). \n\n        Actually, the formula (a + b - 1) // b is the standard way to compute ceiling of a/b for positive integers.\n\n        However, note: the formula works for positive a and b, and we have a=abs_T (nonnegative) and b=x (positive).\n\n        Therefore, we can simply:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          S = sum(cards)\n          T = -S\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n\n          # If abs_T is 0, then we output 0.\n          # Otherwise, k_min = ceil(|T|/x) = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n\n          # But note: if T is negative, we use abs_T, so it's symmetric.\n\n          # However, note: if T is negative, then abs_T is positive, so the formula still holds.\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative and we are using the absolute value? Then we are treating positive and negative the same.\n\n        But note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x, so negative and positive are symmetric.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          t = -s\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n\n          if abs_t == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Ceiling division: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b\n              k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n              print(k_min)\n\n        But wait: what if the required T is negative? Does that matter? \n\n        Example: T = -5, x=3: then abs_t=5, and k_min=(5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3=2 (since 7//3=2 in integer floor division). But ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example above: T=-5, x=3 -> we need two cards. How? \n          We can use two cards: -3 and -2 -> -5. So yes.\n\n        But wait, what if T=5 and x=3? Same.\n\n        Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n        However, wait: there is a different approach that might yield a lower number of cards? \n\n        Let me think: the above reasoning is based on the fact that with k cards we can represent any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the cards to be distinct. We are allowed to use any card multiple times.\n\n        And we proved the contiguousness by induction.\n\n        But wait: is there a possibility that we can use fewer cards by using a combination that is not just the maximum absolute value? \n\n        Example: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2. \n          We can use two cards: 3 and 1 -> 4. \n\n        But can we use one card? The maximum positive card is 3, so no.\n\n        Another example: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=2. \n          Two cards: 3+2=5 -> yes.\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        However, note: the above formula holds.\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need to add any card, so 0.\n\n        However, what if the current sum is 0? Then T=0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          t = -s\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n\n          if abs_t == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n              print(k_min)\n\n        However, wait: there is a special case that I missed?\n\n        Consider: what if T is not zero, but we can form T by adding a single card that is exactly T, provided that T is in the range [-x, x]? \n\n        But note: our formula already uses the entire range, so if |T| <= x, then k_min=ceil(|T|/x)=ceil(|T|/x) which is 1 if |T|>0 and <=x.\n\n        Example: T=2, x=3 -> ceil(2/3)=1. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if T=4, x=3? ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if T=3, x=3? ceil(3/3)=1. Correct.\n\n        However, note: what if T=4, x=3: we cannot use one card because the maximum card is 3. So two cards is the minimal.\n\n        But wait: is there a way to use one card for T=4? No.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example in the problem: \n          Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> sum=-4, T=4 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2.\n\n        But note: the example output is 2.\n\n        However, the example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. The cards can have any integer value from -x to x, and there are infinitely many of each.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero after adding some cards. The sum of the additional cards must therefore be the negation of the current sum of the found cards (denoted as T = -S, where S is the sum of the found cards). The goal is to find the smallest number of cards (each between -x and x) whose sum is exactly T.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of T divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards the sum. Therefore, the minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer k such that k * x ≥ |T|.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the current sum S of the found cards, then computing T as -S. The absolute value of T is then used to determine the minimal number of cards using ceiling division. If T is zero, no cards are needed.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a simple sum calculation and a ceiling division operation, both of which run in O(n) time for summing the cards and O(1) for the division. Given that n is up to 1000 and x up to 1000, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    T = -total_sum\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    \n    if abs_T == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by a list of n integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum T is the negation of this sum, which needs to be achieved by adding new cards.\n3. **Absolute Value Check**: If the absolute value of T is zero, it means no additional cards are needed, and the answer is 0.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero T, the minimal number of cards required is calculated using ceiling division. This is done by the formula `(abs_T + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the smallest integer k such that k * x ≥ abs(T).\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to make the sum of all cards zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insight to solve the problem with minimal computational overhead.",
