Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. We need to check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight lines drawn from each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect.\n\n Observation:\n Since the number of points is small (at most 10), we can try to use a combinatorial matching approach. However, note that the condition is about non-intersecting straight lines.\n\n Important: The problem states that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.\n\n Conditions for non-intersecting paths in the plane for straight line segments? Actually, note: we are drawing straight paths from base to spaceship. But note: the entire assignment must be non-intersecting. However, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning the set of edges (from base to spaceship) should not cross.\n\n This is similar to drawing a set of non-intersecting edges in the plane. In graph drawing, we can assign an ordering to the points and then use the concept of planar matching.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the edges must form a planar embedding without crossings, but we are free to choose the matching.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have two sets: S (spaceships) and B (bases). We need to assign each base to one spaceship (and vice versa) so that the straight line segments connecting them do not intersect.\n\n 2. Since the total number of points (R+B) is at most 20, but note that we are only matching R to B, and R,B <=10, we cannot iterate over all permutations if R and B are 10 because that would be factorial.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider the following: \n   - We are allowed to draw straight lines from bases to spaceships, and the condition is that these lines do not cross.\n\n There is a known fact: In the plane, a set of straight line segments (edges) connecting two sets (with one-to-one assignment) without crossings is equivalent to the two sets being interleaved in a particular way when the points are sorted by x-coordinate (or by some other order) and then matched in that order.\n\n However, note: the problem does not fix the order of the bases or spaceships. We can assign arbitrarily.\n\n Idea: \n   - Sort all the points (both spaceships and bases) by x-coordinate (and if x equal, by y-coordinate). Then, we want to assign the points alternately to the two sets? But wait, we have two sets: S and B.\n\n Another idea: \n   - We can use the following property: In a set of non-intersecting edges connecting two sets (like a bipartite matching) in the plane, the edges do not cross if and only if the two sets are separable by a monotonic curve? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a method that considers the entire set of points and checks if the matching is non-crossing.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the edges to be drawn without any crossings at all (including with the convex hull, etc.), but only that the edges themselves do not intersect.\n\n There is a well-known fact: A matching of two sets of points (with no three collinear) can be drawn without crossing if and only if the two sets are non-crossing. One way to check is:\n\n   - Sort the points by x-coordinate (and if tie by y-coordinate). Then, the matching must be such that the edges do not cross.\n\n But note: the edges connect two sets: one set is the spaceships and the other is the bases.\n\n We can also consider the following: \n   - We can use a recursive backtracking to try to assign the bases to the spaceships, but R, B <=10, so the maximum matching would be 10! which is 3628800, which is acceptable for 10!.\n\n However, 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we code carefully. But note: the problem says R, B from 1 to 10. So we can have up to 10! = 3628800 possibilities for matching.\n\n But wait, we have two sets of size R and B, and we need a bijection. Actually, the matching is a permutation from B to R (if we consider bases as one set and spaceships as the other). The number of perfect matchings is R! (if R==B) or more generally, if we have two sets of size n and m, then the number of bijections is n! if n==m, but here we are matching R bases to R spaceships? Actually, note: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", so it must be that R = B? Otherwise, we cannot have a perfect matching (each base has one guardian and each spaceship has one base). The problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so it must be that R = B.\n\n Let me check the input: first line has R and B. Then, R lines for spaceships, B lines for bases. The example: first example has R=3, B=3.\n\n Therefore, we must have R=B for a perfect matching. So if R != B, we output 'No'? But wait, the second example: \n   Input: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\" -> R=2, B=1 -> no matching (because 2 != 1). So indeed, if R != B, we cannot have a perfect matching.\n\n So step 1: Check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\n Then, we have two sets of size n = R = B (from 1 to 10). We need to check if there exists a bijection (matching) from the set of bases to the set of spaceships such that the straight line segments (from base to spaceship) do not cross.\n\n How to check for crossing?\n\n   Two edges (a->b and c->d) cross if and only if the four points are in convex position and they form a quadrilateral where the edges are the diagonals? Actually, two line segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) cross if and only if the points are in alternating order.\n\n More precisely, given four distinct points, the segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross if and only if the points are interleaved. That is, if we consider the points in the natural order (say, by x and then y) then the two segments are interleaving.\n\n However, we can use the standard method: two segments (A-B) and (C-D) cross if and only if A and B separate C and D on the line (in terms of the arrangement). But note: the segments are between two sets: one set is the bases, the other is the spaceships.\n\n We can define a function to check if two edges (represented by two pairs of points) cross.\n\n But note: in our matching, we have n edges, and we want to check that none of the edges cross.\n\n However, in a set of edges, two edges might cross even if they are not adjacent. We need to check all pairs.\n\n But note: the condition is that the entire set of edges must be non-crossing.\n\n Now, how to check for a matching (which is a set of edges) whether they are non-crossing?\n\n   We can do:\n     For every pair of edges (i, j) and (k, l) (with i, j, k, l being indices of edges) in the matching, check if they cross.\n\n However, we are going to generate all possible matchings (permutations) and check for each matching if the set of edges is non-crossing.\n\n Steps:\n\n   1. Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n   2. Read the next R lines for spaceships, and the next B lines for bases.\n   3. Since R==B, let n = R = B.\n   4. Generate all permutations of the bases (or the indices of the bases) of length n (i.e., all bijections from bases to spaceships). There are n! permutations.\n\n   But note: we have two sets: we are matching base i to spaceship j. We can represent the matching as a list (or tuple) of length n: for each base (in a fixed order) we assign a spaceship.\n\n   However, we don't have an inherent order for the bases or spaceships. We can fix an order for the bases (for example, by their coordinates) and then permute the spaceships.\n\n   Alternatively, we can fix the order of the bases by sorting them, and then consider all permutations of the spaceships. Then, for a permutation p (which assigns base i to spaceship p[i]), we form edges from base_i to spaceship_p[i].\n\n   But note: the condition of non-crossing is independent of the labeling. However, we must check the edges.\n\n   How to check a set of edges for crossings?\n\n     We have n edges. Each edge is from a base point to a spaceship point.\n\n     We can check all pairs of edges: for two edges (a, b) and (c, d) (where a, b, c, d are the four endpoints, but note: the two edges are disjoint because the matching is one-to-one). The condition for two edges (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) to cross is:\n\n        (orientation(p1, q1, p2) * orientation(p1, q1, q2) < 0) OR \n        (orientation(p2, q2, p1) * orientation(p2, q2, q1) < 0)\n\n     But actually, the standard way is to check if the two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect. However, note that the problem states that no three points are collinear, so we don't have degenerate cases.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let A, B be two edges: edge1 from a to b, edge2 from c to d.\n\n        We say edge1 and edge2 cross if and only if:\n          - a, c, b, d are in clockwise order (when traversing the quadrilateral) or a, d, b, c.\n\n        More precisely, we can check by:\n\n          def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # Check if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect\n            def ccw(A, B, C):\n                return (C[1]-A[1]) * (B[0]-A[0]) > (B[1]-A[1]) * (C[0]-A[0])\n\n            # Return true if line segments AB and CD intersect.\n            o1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n            o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n            o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n            o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n            if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n                return True\n\n            # Special cases: collinear? but problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about touching at endpoints? Actually, the problem says no two points coincide and no three points are collinear, so the endpoints are distinct and no three are collinear. Therefore, the only way two segments share an endpoint is if they share a common vertex? But in our matching, each vertex is used once, so two edges share no common vertex. Therefore, we don't have to worry about sharing endpoints.\n\n            However, note: the matching is from bases to spaceships, so the two sets are distinct. Therefore, no two edges share a vertex.\n\n            So the above ccw condition is sufficient? Actually, the above condition returns True if the two segments intersect (properly) or if they are collinear? But we know no three are collinear, so we can rely on the above.\n\n        However, there is a simpler way: we can use the orientation method.\n\n        But note: we are going to check many edges (n*(n-1)/2 pairs) and n<=10, so 45 pairs per matching, and 10! = 3628800 matchings, then 45 * 3628800 ~ 163 million checks. Each check involves 4 ccw calculations (each ccw is 4 multiplications and 2 subtractions). This might be acceptable in C++ but in Python 163 million * (cost of 4 ccw) might be too slow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more efficient method: \n\n        We can sort the points (all points together) by x and then by y, and then check the matching in that order. \n\n        There is a known fact: In a set of non-crossing edges connecting two sets (the two sets are interleaved in the sorted order) then the matching is non-crossing if and only if the edges do not cross when drawn as straight lines. But note: we are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n        We can use the following: \n\n          Sort all the points (both spaceships and bases) by x (and then by y). Then, we can traverse from left to right and use a greedy matching? But we have two sets.\n\n        However, there is a known algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching: \n\n          We can fix the order of the two sets by their coordinates and then the matching must be non-crossing. But note: the two sets are fixed: one is the base set and one is the spaceship set.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Step 1: Combine the two sets and sort by x (and if x equal, by y). Then, we traverse from left to right. When we meet a base or a spaceship, we can assign the next available spaceship (or base) to it? But we have two sets.\n\n        Actually, there's a known fact: A set of edges connecting two sets (without crossings) is non-crossing if and only if the following holds: \n\n          When we sort the entire set of points (from both sets) by x (and then by y) then the edges must be drawn without crossing, and this is equivalent to the matching being non-crossing.\n\n        But note: the two sets are distinct. We can use a recursive method that uses the entire set of points.\n\n        However, since n is small, we can use the following: \n\n          We generate all permutations (matchings) and for each matching, we check for every pair of edges if they cross.\n\n        But 10! is 3628800 and for each matching we check about 45 pairs, so 3628800 * 45 = 163,296,000 checks. Each check involves 4 ccw computations (each ccw is 4 multiplications and 2 subtractions, so 6 operations per ccw, and 4*6=24 operations per check). Then 163296000 * 24 operations is about 3.9 billion operations. This is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline.\n\n        However, note: we have to read the input and then do the matching. But 3.9 billion operations in Python might take several minutes (each operation is a simple arithmetic, but still, 4 seconds per 1e9 operations, so 15.6 seconds). \n\n        But wait: the problem constraints say R, B <= 10, but worst-case 10! is about 3.6e6, and 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6, which is 162 million checks. And each check does 4 ccw, each ccw does 2 subtractions and 2 multiplications (so 8 arithmetic operations). Then 162e6 * 8 = 1.296e9 operations. In Python, let's assume 1e9 operations per second (which is typical for simple arithmetic in compiled languages, but in Python maybe 10-100 times slower). So worst-case 100 seconds? That is too slow.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We can use a recursive backtracking that builds the matching from left to right (by x-coordinate) and prunes when a crossing is detected. But note: the matching is arbitrary.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n   We can use the following property: \n\n      A set of edges (from base to spaceship) is non-crossing if and only if the following holds: \n\n        For any two edges (a-b) and (c-d), the order of the bases and the order of the spaceships (in the entire sorted order) must be consistent.\n\n   Specifically, if we sort all the points (both bases and spaceships) by x (and then by y) then the matching must be such that the sequence of bases and spaceships must alternate and the edges must be drawn without crossing.\n\n   However, there is a known method: \n\n        Sort all the points (both) by x (and then by y). Then, we can use dynamic programming or recursion that goes from left to right and matches the leftmost point to a spaceship (if it's a base) and then recursively solve for the rest.\n\n   But note: we have two sets: we don't know which is which.\n\n   Steps for the recursive method:\n\n        Let P = sorted list of all points, but we remember which are bases and which are spaceships.\n\n        Then, we traverse the list from left to right. At each step, we consider the leftmost unmatched base and the leftmost unmatched spaceship? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n\n          We require that the matching is non-crossing. In a non-crossing matching, the edges do not cross, so if we draw the entire set of edges, they will form a planar graph.\n\n        There is a well-known fact: In a set of two colors (say red for bases and blue for spaceships) and we want to connect each red to a blue without crossing, then the matching is non-crossing if and only if the sequence of colors (when reading from left to right, top to bottom) is such that the matching is the same as the order of the bases and the order of the spaceships.\n\n        However, we can use the following recursive function:\n\n          def can_match(left_index, bases_remaining, spaceships_remaining):\n            # left_index: current index in the sorted list of all points\n            # We process from left to right. At the leftmost unmatched point, we must assign the other color (if it's a base, then we must assign the smallest unmatched spaceship to the leftmost base, and then recursively check the rest?).\n\n        Actually, the standard way to build non-crossing matchings is to use the following:\n\n          Sort all points by x (and if tie by y). Then, the matching must satisfy: if we have two edges (a, b) and (c, d) then a and c are consecutive in the entire set? Not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following greedy:\n\n          While there are unmatched points:\n            Take the leftmost unmatched point (lowest x, and if tie lowest y).\n            Then, from the unmatched points of the opposite set, choose the one that is closest (in terms of the direction of the edge) and then remove both.\n\n        But that doesn't guarantee non-crossing.\n\n        There is a known algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching: \n\n          We can use the following: \n\n            Sort all the points (both) by x (and then by y). Then, we can use a stack to keep the unmatched points of one set and the other set. \n\n        However, after some thought, there is a simpler method: \n\n          We can use the following property: \n\n            Two edges (a, b) and (c, d) (with a, b, c, d being points) do not cross if and only if the points a and b are not separated by the segment (c,d) in the sense of the plane.\n\n        But we already have a condition (using ccw) for two edges.\n\n        Given the small n, we can try to use a different representation: \n\n          Instead of generating all permutations, we can use a state space search (DP) that considers the set of matched spaceships (or bases) and the set of matched bases (or spaceships). But the state space is 2^n * 2^n? That would be 2^(2*n) which for n=10 is 2^20 ~ 1e6 states, which is acceptable. But then we have to check for crossings as we assign? Or we can check at the end.\n\n        But the problem: we need to check if there exists one matching that is non-crossing.\n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n          Let n = R = B.\n\n          We have two sets: \n            Bases: list of base coordinates, index 0 to n-1.\n            Spaceships: list of spaceship coordinates, index 0 to n-1.\n\n          We can consider matching the bases in a fixed order (for example, sorted by x and then y). Then, we assign a spaceship to each base.\n\n          We can use DP with bitmask: \n\n            dp[mask][perm_mask] ? Not exactly.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use state = mask for bases that have been matched, and then we try to assign the next base (in sorted order) to any unmatched spaceship and check if the new edge crosses any existing edge.\n\n          But note: the non-crossing condition depends on the entire set of edges.\n\n          However, we can check for crossing between the new edge and the existing edges.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Sort the bases by x (and then y) and similarly sort the spaceships by x (and then y) [but we don't need to sort the spaceships, we just assign arbitrarily].\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Sort all bases and spaceships together by x (and then y) and then use the entire set.\n\n          But let me think: \n\n            We are going to assign bases (from the sorted base list) to spaceships (from the sorted spaceship list?) but the matching does not necessarily preserve the order.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n            We know that a matching is non-crossing if and only if the following holds: \n\n              Let the entire set of points (bases and spaceships) be sorted by x (and then y). Then, the matching is non-crossing if and only if the edges do not cross, and one necessary condition is that the relative order of the bases and spaceships must be alternating.\n\n          However, there is a known algorithm: \n\n            We can use a greedy matching from left to right: \n\n              Sort all points (both) by x (and then y). Then, we can use two pointers: one for bases and one for spaceships. But we don't know the assignment.\n\n          After research, I recall that the problem of determining if there exists a non-crossing matching between two sets of points is solvable by checking the consistency of the two orders.\n\n        However, given the time, and that n<=10, we can use the following:\n\n          We generate all permutations (matchings) but we do so in a smarter way: we break early if a crossing is detected.\n\n          We can represent the matching as an array: match[i] = j, meaning base i is matched to spaceship j.\n\n          We can precompute a function that, given two edges (i, j) and (k, l) (where i,k are base indices and j,l are spaceship indices) checks if they cross.\n\n          Then, we iterate over all permutations (for the assignment of bases to spaceships). But we can break early in the permutation generation if we detect a crossing.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Precompute a list of base points and spaceship points.\n\n            We'll generate all permutations of range(n) (which represents assigning base i to spaceship perm[i]).\n\n            For each permutation, we check:\n\n              For k from 0 to n-1: \n                edge_k = (base[k], spaceship[perm[k]])\n\n              Then, for every pair of edges (k, l) with k < l, check if they cross.\n\n            If we find a permutation that has no crossing edges, output 'Yes' and break.\n\n            If none found, output 'No'.\n\n        But the worst-case is still 10! = 3628800, and for each we do O(n^2) crossing checks (about 45 checks). \n\n        However, we can optimize by breaking early: as soon as we add an edge that causes a crossing with any previously added edge, we break and try the next permutation.\n\n        But note: the edges are defined by the entire matching. We have to check the entire set of edges. However, we can check incrementally: \n\n          We can store the edges as we build the permutation (but we are building the entire permutation anyway). \n\n        Alternatively, we can check the entire set of edges for one matching by iterating over all pairs.\n\n        But 3628800 * 45 is 163 million, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might be able to do it in a few minutes? But the problem says competitive programming and we have to be efficient.\n\n        However, note that 10! is 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 is 163296000, which is about 163 million. In Python, a simple loop of 163 million iterations might take a few seconds (if each iteration is very fast). \n\n        Let's test: \n\n          For two edges, we do 4 ccw calculations.\n\n          The ccw function:\n\n            def ccw(A, B, C):\n                return (C[1]-A[1]) * (B[0]-A[0]) > (B[1]-A[1]) * (C[0]-A[0])\n\n          We can write it as:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                # Check if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect\n                def cross(o, a, b):\n                    return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) > (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n                # or using the above ccw\n                if cross(a, b, c) != cross(a, b, d) and cross(c, d, a) != cross(c, d, b):\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n          But wait, the standard method:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def orientation(p, q, r):\n                    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n                    if val == 0:\n                        return 0\n                    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n                if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n                    return True\n\n                return False\n\n          But note: the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't get 0.\n\n        However, we can use the cross product version without the full orientation:\n\n          We can use the following: \n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                # Check orientation of the four points for the two segments\n                def cross(o, a, b):\n                    return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n                o1 = cross(a, b, c)\n                o2 = cross(a, b, d)\n                o3 = cross(c, d, a)\n                o4 = cross(c, d, b)\n\n                if ((o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)):\n                    return True\n\n                return False\n\n        But note: the above is correct for proper intersections (not including endpoints) and since our edges don't share endpoints, it's sufficient.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the segments_intersect function must return True only if the segments cross (properly). \n\n        But the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". Since the endpoints are distinct and no three collinear, we don't have to worry about touching at endpoints.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the above function.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read R and B. If R != B, print \"No\" and exit.\n\n            Step 2: Read the next R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n            Step 3: If R==B, then proceed.\n\n            Step 4: We have two lists:\n                spaceships = list of (x, y) for the R spaceships.\n                bases = list of (x, y) for the B bases.\n\n            Step 5: Generate all permutations of range(R) (since we have R spaceships, and we are matching the B bases (which equals R) to the R spaceships). Actually, we have two sets: bases and spaceships, and we are matching each base (we have R bases) to a spaceship (we have R spaceships). But wait, the input: the first R lines are spaceships, then B lines are bases. And we know R==B.\n\n            Step 6: For each permutation p (which is a list of length R: p[i] is the spaceship index assigned to base i), we form R edges: for i in range(R): edge = (bases[i], spaceships[p[i]])\n\n            Step 7: Check all pairs of edges (i, j) for i < j to see if they intersect.\n\n            Step 8: If we find a permutation with no intersecting edges, output \"Yes\" and break. Otherwise, continue.\n\n            Step 9: If no permutation works, output \"No\".\n\n        But wait: the bases are given in the input, but we haven't sorted them. We must consider: the problem does not specify an order for the bases. \n\n        However, the condition of non-crossing is independent of the order of the bases? Actually, the matching is a bijection, so the assignment is from the set of bases (given) to the set of spaceships (given). \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify which base is which. We are allowed to assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the bases in any order. \n\n        However, the way we generate the permutation: we are matching base0 to spaceship[p[0]], base1 to spaceship[p[1]], etc. But the input bases are given in a fixed order. \n\n        The problem: the input bases are given in an arbitrary order. But note: the condition of non-crossing does not depend on the labels of the bases. \n\n        But wait: the condition is about the straight paths. The straight path from base i to spaceship j is fixed. \n\n        However, the problem does not require the bases to be assigned in a particular order. We are free to assign any base to any spaceship. \n\n        Therefore, we must consider all bases (as given) and assign them arbitrarily to the spaceships.\n\n        But note: the input order of bases might matter for our permutation. Actually, we are going to consider the bases in the given order. However, the problem does not specify that the bases are labeled. \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n          The problem says: \"The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.\"\n\n          Then, we are to assign each base (meaning each of the B bases) to one spaceship.\n\n          Therefore, we have two sets: \n            Set S: the R spaceships (given by R lines)\n            Set B: the B bases (given by B lines)\n\n          And we want a bijection f: B -> S.\n\n          Our permutation method: we fix the order of the bases by their input order. Then we assign base0 to spaceship[p[0]], base1 to spaceship[p[1]], ... \n\n          But note: the condition of non-crossing is geometric and does not depend on the labeling. However, the assignment is defined by the bijection, so we are effectively considering the set of bases and the set of spaceships.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply consider the list of bases as given, and the list of spaceships as given, and generate all permutations of the spaceship indices.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: \n            2 2\n            0 0   # spaceship0\n            1 1   # spaceship1\n            0 2   # base0\n            1 0   # base1\n\n          We have two bases and two spaceships. We want to check if there is a bijection (two possibilities):\n\n            Option1: base0->spaceship0, base1->spaceship1: edges (0,2)-(0,0) and (1,0)-(1,1). These two edges: \n                Edge1: from (0,2) to (0,0) -> vertical line at x=0 from y=0 to y=2.\n                Edge2: from (1,0) to (1,1) -> vertical line at x=1 from y=0 to y=1.\n                They do not cross.\n\n            Option2: base0->spaceship1, base1->spaceship0: edges (0,2)-(1,1) and (1,0)-(0,0). \n                Edge1: (0,2) to (1,1): from (0,2) to (1,1)\n                Edge2: (1,0) to (0,0): from (1,0) to (0,0)\n                Do these two edges cross? \n                  Line1: from (0,2) to (1,1): parametric equations: x=t, y=2-t (t from 0 to 1)\n                  Line2: from (1,0) to (0,0): y=0, x from 1 to 0.\n                  They meet at (1,0)? But (1,0) is the endpoint of edge2 and not an endpoint of edge1? \n                  Actually, (1,0) is not on edge1: because for edge1, when t=1, y=1, not 0.\n\n                Let me compute: \n                  Equation of edge1: (x-0)/(1-0) = (y-2)/(1-2) => x = -(y-2) => x+y=2.\n                  Equation of edge2: from (1,0) to (0,0): y=0, x from 0 to 1.\n\n                Intersection: x+y=2 and y=0 -> x=2. But x=2 is outside the segment edge1 (which goes from x=0 to 1) and edge2 (x from 0 to 1). So no intersection.\n\n                But wait: the segment edge1: from (0,2) to (1,1) and edge2: from (1,0) to (0,0). \n                The two segments: \n                  (0,2) to (1,1): goes through (0.5, 1.5)\n                  (1,0) to (0,0): goes through (0.5,0)\n\n                They do not share any interior point.\n\n            However, wait: the example output says for the first example (with 3 and 3) is Yes, and the second (2 and 1) is No.\n\n        But note: the example input was given as:\n\n          ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n        We must be cautious: the second example has R=2, B=1, so we output 'No'. \n\n        So we'll code accordingly.\n\n        However, the example with 2 and 2: both assignments are non-crossing, so we should output 'Yes'. \n\n        But wait, what if the edges cross? \n\n        Let me test with a crossing example:\n\n          Input: \n            2 2\n            0 0   # spaceship0\n            2 2   # spaceship1\n            1 1   # base0\n            1 -1  # base1\n\n          Then, the two possibilities:\n\n            Option1: base0->spaceship0, base1->spaceship1: \n                Edge1: (1,1) to (0,0)\n                Edge2: (1,-1) to (2,2)\n\n                Check: \n                  Edge1: from (1,1) to (0,0): y = x (from (0,0) to (1,1))\n                  Edge2: from (1,-1) to (2,2): slope = (2-(-1))/(2-1)=3, so y+1=3(x-1) -> y=3x-4.\n\n                Solve: x = 3x-4 -> 2x=4 -> x=2, y=2. But (2,2) is the endpoint of edge2, and (2,2) is not on edge1 (edge1 goes from (0,0) to (1,1)). So they don't cross.\n\n            Option2: base0->spaceship1, base1->spaceship0:\n                Edge1: (1,1) to (2,2): y=x\n                Edge2: (1,-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible bijections (matchings) between the bases and spaceships and verifying if any of these matchings satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching between two sets of points (bases and spaceships) such that no two connecting lines intersect. Given the constraints (R and B are up to 10), a brute-force approach is feasible since the number of permutations to check is manageable (10! = 3,628,800).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible permutation of spaceship assignments to bases, we need to verify that none of the line segments connecting the bases to their assigned spaceships intersect. The solution leverages geometric properties to check for segment intersections using cross products.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutations Generation**: Generate all possible bijections (permutations) between the bases and spaceships.\n   - **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments to see if they intersect. The intersection is determined using the cross product method, which efficiently checks if two line segments cross without sharing endpoints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case scenario involves generating all permutations (n!) and for each permutation, checking all pairs of segments (O(n^2) per permutation). With n ≤ 10, this results in approximately 3.6 million * 45 = 163 million operations, which is feasible given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    index = 2\n    spaceships = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    n = R\n    \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        def cross(o, a, b):\n            return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n        \n        def sign(x):\n            return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n            \n        o1 = sign(cross(a, b, c))\n        o2 = sign(cross(a, b, d))\n        o3 = sign(cross(c, d, a))\n        o4 = sign(cross(c, d, b))\n        \n        if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):\n        edges = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            base_point = bases[i]\n            ship_point = spaceships[perm[i]]\n            edges.append((base_point, ship_point))\n            \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(edges)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):\n                a, b = edges[i]\n                c, d = edges[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of bases (R) and spaceships (B). If R and B are not equal, the answer is immediately \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n\n2. **Spaceship and Base Coordinates**: The coordinates of the spaceships and bases are stored in lists.\n\n3. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses cross products to determine if two line segments intersect. The cross product helps in checking the orientation of three points, ensuring accurate intersection detection without endpoint sharing.\n\n4. **Permutations and Validation**: All permutations of spaceship assignments to bases are generated. For each permutation, every pair of line segments is checked for intersection.
