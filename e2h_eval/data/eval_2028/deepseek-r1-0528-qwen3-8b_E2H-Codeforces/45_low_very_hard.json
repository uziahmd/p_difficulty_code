There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games.\n\n But note: the rule says two players can play only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the winner must win k consecutive games.\n\n How does the tournament structure work?\n The problem is similar to building a binary tree where the winner must have k rounds (so k wins). However, the rule about the condition on the number of games played (which is the same as the round number) imposes a constraint.\n\n Actually, note that the condition is: two players can play if the difference between their games is at most one.\n\n This condition is similar to having a \"balanced\" bracket system. The winner must go through rounds, and the structure must allow the winner to play one game per round.\n\n However, the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Let's think:\n\n - In the first game, the winner plays one game.\n - Then, to play a second game, he must wait until the other matches in his section (if any) have been played? Actually, note that the condition is about the number of games the players have already played.\n\n Consider:\n\n Example: n=4\n\n One way: \n   Round 1: [1 vs 2] and [3 vs 4]\n   Then the winner of round1 (say 1) and winner of round2 (say 3) play in round2.\n\n But note: when the two winners meet, player1 has played 1 game, and player3 has played 1 game -> so condition holds (difference 0). Then the winner of round2 (say 1) has now 2 games.\n\n Alternatively, could we have a structure where the winner plays more than 2 games?\n\n For n=4, the maximum depth (rounds) is 2, so the winner must play 2 games.\n\n Example: n=10\n\n How to compute?\n\n Another approach: we can model the tournament as a complete binary tree. But note: the condition is not just about the rounds but also about the balance.\n\n Actually, let's define:\n   Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a tournament where the winner can play k games.\n\n How do we form a tournament with k games for the winner?\n\n We can think recursively:\n\n   In the first round, the winner must play one game. So we need at least 2 players for him to play (but we have many). However, after winning the first game, the winner must face opponents that have played at most 1 game (because the condition: the winner has 1 game, so the opponent must have 0 or 1).\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must be arranged such that the winner can get to the k-th game.\n\n   We can break down the tournament into two halves: one half containing the winner's path and the other containing the rest.\n\n   However, the condition allows the winner to accumulate wins and then the rest of the bracket must be filled in a way that the winner can continue.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n   To have a tournament that requires the winner to play k games, we need:\n\n     - The first game: the winner and one opponent. The rest of the tournament must have enough players to fill the other side.\n\n     But note: the tournament is single elimination.\n\n   Alternatively, consider that the tournament can be seen as a balanced bracket. The winner must beat k opponents. However, the condition is that the opponents he faces in different rounds must have played a certain number of games.\n\n   Insight from known similar problems (like CodeForces problems) and from the sample:\n\n     Input: n = 2 -> output 1\n            n = 3 -> output 2\n            n = 4 -> output 2\n            n = 10 -> output 4\n\n   We note that:\n\n        n=2: k=1\n        n=3: k=2\n        n=4: k=2\n        n=5: k=2? Actually, wait: if n=5, then we can have:\n\n          Round1: [1 vs 2], [3 vs 4] and then the fifth player sits out? But no, the fifth player must be integrated.\n\n        Actually, the problem states that two players can play only if their previous games differ by at most one.\n\n        How about we build the tournament as a sequence of rounds, and the winner must play one game per round, but the entire bracket must be filled.\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games does not exceed one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint. The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players required to have a winner play \\( k \\) games is less than or equal to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem can be approached by recognizing that the tournament can be modeled using a binary tree structure where each level represents a round of the tournament. The winner must win \\( k \\) consecutive games, and the number of players needed for such a tournament is given by the sum of a series related to powers of two.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iteratively calculating the maximum \\( k \\) such that the sum of \\( 2^i \\) terms (starting from \\( i = 0 \\)) does not exceed \\( n \\). Specifically, we start with \\( k = 0 \\) and keep doubling the number of players until adding another term would exceed \\( n \\). The value of \\( k \\) at this point gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time because each iteration roughly doubles the number of players considered, leading to logarithmic growth relative to the input size \\( n \\). This is efficient even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    k = 0\n    total = 1\n    while total < n:\n        k += 1\n        total *= 2\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input \\( n \\) (number of players) is read. Variables `k` (count of games) and `total` (current total players) are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.\n2. **Loop Until Condition Met**: The loop continues as long as `total` is less than \\( n \\). In each iteration:\n   - Increment `k` by 1 (indicating one more game for the winner).\n   - Double `total` (simulating the exponential growth of players needed for each subsequent round).\n3. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, `k` holds the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the solution by leveraging the properties of binary exponentiation, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of \\( n \\).",
