There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament grid must follow the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the rule allows for some flexibility. However, note that the winner must win k games. Therefore, the tournament must have at least k rounds for the winner, but the structure might not be strictly balanced.\n\n Let's denote that the winner plays g games. Then, we must have a bracket such that the winner can accumulate g wins, and the entire tournament can be arranged with the given constraint.\n\n How to model?\n Another way: we can consider that the tournament is built from a full binary tree? But note: the constraint is about the difference in the number of games (i.e., wins) between two players.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recursive/dynamic programming approach or mathematical formulation.\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that a player can win k games under the given rule.\n\n Consider: \n - To win 0 games: then the winner doesn't play any game. But the tournament must have at least 1 player (the winner) and no other? Actually, the tournament must have at least 2 players to have a game. But note: the problem says there are n players, and the winner is one of them.\n\n However, note: the winner must have played k games. In each game, the winner advances. The rule says that when scheduling a match, the two players must have played a number of games that differ by at most one.\n\n We can think of building the tournament as having levels. The winner must go through k wins. Before the first win, the winner has 0 wins. After the first win, 1, then 2, etc.\n\n But also, the rest of the players must be arranged in subtrees that do not interfere with the main path of the winner.\n\n However, note the constraint: two players can play only if the number of games they have played so far (wins) differs by at most one.\n\n This resembles the structure of a \"colored\" tournament or perhaps a Fibonacci-like structure?\n\n Let's define:\n   Let F(0) = 1 (the winner without having played any game? but wait, the winner must start by playing someone. Alternatively, we can think of the state of the tournament as the number of wins the winner has and the total players needed to set up the rest.)\n\n Alternatively, let's define:\n   Let g(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to have k wins, and the entire tournament (so including all the byes and other matches) is arranged.\n\n Conditions:\n   - The first game: the winner must play one opponent. The opponent must have 0 wins (since the winner has 0 wins). So we need one opponent. Then the winner now has 1 win, and the opponent leaves.\n\n   - For the second win: the winner must play someone who has either 0 or 1 win. But note: the winner has 1 win. The opponents available are:\n        * Players that haven't played at all (0 wins) OR \n        * Players that have 1 win (from previous rounds).\n\n   However, we cannot have a player with 1 win if we haven't set up the necessary structure. \n\n   Actually, we can break down the tournament into a main path (the winner's path) and other subtrees.\n\n   Consider: to have k wins, the winner must beat k opponents. But these opponents must have been accumulated from subtrees that are built according to the same rules.\n\n   Let's define:\n      T(0) = 1   [only the winner, no games]\n      T(1) = 2   [one game: winner and one opponent]\n\n   Now, for T(2): the winner must have two wins. The first win was against one opponent (which was a player that started with 0 wins). Then for the second win, the winner must play an opponent that has either 0 or 1 win.\n\n   But note: the opponent for the second win must be the winner of a subtree. How many players are needed for that subtree?\n\n   Case 1: The opponent for the second win has 0 wins. Then the opponent must be a player that hasn't played any game. But then we have two players (the winner and the two opponents: one for the first game and one for the second). However, the first game opponent must have been eliminated, so the second game opponent must come from a separate branch. But wait, the first game",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their number of previous games is at most one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the winner must win all their games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the constraint that any opponent must have a number of previous games differing by at most one from the winner's current count. This resembles a binary tree structure where each level represents a round of the tournament.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games does not exceed `n`. This is derived from a recurrence relation where:\n   - `T(0) = 1` (the winner without any games)\n   - `T(1) = 2` (winner plays one game)\n   - For `k >= 2`, the minimum number of players required is `T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)`. This is because each game the winner plays requires either a new opponent or an opponent who has played one fewer game than the winner's current count.\n3. **Binary Search**: Given the constraints (n can be as large as 10^18), we use binary search to efficiently find the maximum `k` such that `T(k) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Using binary search to find the maximum k such that T(k) <= n\n    low, high = 1, 1000000000\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if mid == 1:\n            t1 = 2\n        elif mid == 2:\n            t2 = 3\n        else:\n            t1 = 2\n            t2 = 3\n            for i in range(3, mid+1):\n                t_next = t1 + t2\n                t1 = t2\n                t2 = t_next\n        if t2 <= n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    k = low - 1\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there are only 2 players, the winner plays 1 game.\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: The search is conducted between 1 and a sufficiently large upper bound (1,000,000,000) to cover all possible values of `k`.\n3. **Recurrence Calculation**: For each midpoint `mid` during the binary search, compute the minimum number of players required (`T(mid)`) using the recurrence relation `T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)`. This is done iteratively to avoid redundant calculations.\n4. **Binary Search Adjustment**: If the computed `T(mid)` is less than or equal to `n`, the search continues for higher values of `k`; otherwise, it searches lower values.\n5. **Result Output**: After the loop, the maximum valid `k` is printed, representing the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `k` using binary search and leverages the recurrence relation to ensure optimal performance even for very large `n`.",
