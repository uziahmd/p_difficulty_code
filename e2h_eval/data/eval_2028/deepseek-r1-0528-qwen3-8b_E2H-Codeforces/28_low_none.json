String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of beautiful strings that can be formed by starting from a string (which we can consider as being built backwards) with exactly n zeros and m ones, and ending with a single character g (if the process is reversed) but note: the process is defined as repeatedly replacing the last two characters with one. However, note that the problem does not require the entire process to be reversed; rather, we are given that the final string must have the last modification result in g? Actually, wait.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" and then defines the modification. This implies that we start with a string of length (n+m) and apply a series of reverse operations (each operation takes two last characters and replaces them with one according to the rule) until we get a string of length 1, which must be g? Or is it that the original string must be such that after some modifications (until we can't modify anymore) we end up with g?\n\nHowever, reading the example: \n Input: \"1 1 0\" -> Output: 2, meaning there are two beautiful strings. The beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". \n\nBut note: if we take \"01\", we cannot modify it because the length is 2, so we can do one modification: \n   For \"01\": the last two are '0' and '1'. According to the rule: \n        replacement rule: if we replace two last characters, then the new character is '1' only if both are zeros? Otherwise, it's '0'.\n        So for \"01\": the two last are '0' and '1' -> not both zeros -> so the replacement is '0'. Then we get \"0\" (from replacing \"01\" by '0')? But wait, the example says that \"01\" is beautiful and the answer is 2. \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.\" and then the condition about obtaining g from s.\n\nActually, the problem states: \n   We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\n\nThis means that we can perform a sequence of modifications until we get a string of length 1, and that string must be g. \n\nBut note: the example input \"1 1 0\" has two beautiful strings: \"01\" and \"10\". \n\nLet's check:\n   \"01\": \n        Operation: replace last two (which are '0','1') -> becomes '0' (because not both zeros). Then we have a string \"0\", which is g=0. So it satisfies.\n   \"10\":\n        Operation: replace last two (which are '1','0') -> becomes '0' (because not both zeros). Then we have \"0\", which is g=0. So it satisfies.\n\nAnother sample: \"2 2 0\" -> output 4. The beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nLet's check \"0011\":\n        Operation1: replace last two of \"0011\" -> last two are '1','1': both ones? Then the rule says: if we replace two zeros then we get 1, otherwise (if not two zeros) then 0. Wait, note: the rule says \"one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero\". So for two ones: not two zeros -> so becomes 0. Then we have \"001\" (wait, no: we replace the last two, so we remove the last two and put one. The string becomes the first part (without the last two) plus the new character. So \"0011\" becomes \"00\" + (replacement of '1','1') = \"000\"? Then we have \"000\", then we can do another operation: replace last two of \"000\" -> last two are '0','0' -> then we get '1', so we have \"01\", then we cannot do again (length=2) so we don't? Actually, wait: the process stops when we cannot modify (i.e., length <2). But the problem says we can do some (possibly zero) number of modifications until we get g. \n\nBut note: the problem does not specify that we have to reduce the string to length 1. It just says we can obtain g (which is a single character) from s. So we must be able to reduce the string to a single character, and that single character must",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be formed under specific conditions. A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and after performing a series of modifications (each replacing the last two characters with one according to certain rules), the final single character must be `g`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the process of modifying the string (replacing the last two characters with one) is reversible. Each modification reduces the string length by one, and the entire process continues until the string length is 1, which must be `g`. The problem can be transformed into counting the number of valid sequences of operations that reduce the string from length `n + m` to length 1, ending with `g`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming and Combinatorics**: The solution involves dynamic programming where we consider the sequence of operations. The state `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to form a string with `i` zeros and `j` ones that ends with a character `k` (0 or 1) and can be reduced to `k` through modifications. However, given the constraints (up to 10^5 for `n` and `m`), a direct DP approach is infeasible.\n\n3. **Insight**: Instead, we recognize that the problem can be broken down into considering the sequence of operations. Each operation depends on the last two characters. The total number of operations required to reduce the string from length `L = n + m` to 1 is `L - 1`. Each operation either produces a '0' or a '1' based on the last two characters of the current string.\n\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**: The solution involves calculating combinations and using modular arithmetic. The answer is derived by considering all possible ways to partition the operations such that the final character is `g`, and ensuring the counts of zeros and ones in the original string match `n` and `m`.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The solution uses precomputed binomial coefficients modulo 1,000,000,007 to efficiently compute combinations, leveraging properties of modular inverses and dynamic programming for coefficient calculation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    g = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_length = n + m\n    if total_length == 1:\n        if g == 0 and n == 1 and m == 0:\n            print(1)\n        elif g == 1 and n == 0 and m == 1:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(0)\n        return\n\n    max_n = 200000\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n        \n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n, 0, -1):\n        inv_fact[i-1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD\n\n    def nCr(n_val, r_val):\n        if r_val < 0 or r_val > n_val:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n_val] * inv_fact[r_val] % MOD * inv_fact[n_val - r_val] % MOD\n\n    k = total_length - 1\n    if g == 0:\n        ans = 0\n        for t in range(0, k+1, 2):\n            zeros_needed = (t + 1) // 2\n            ones_needed = t // 2\n            if zeros_needed <= n and ones_needed <= m:\n                rest_zeros = n - zeros_needed\n                rest_ones = m - ones_needed\n                if rest_zeros >= 0 and rest_ones >= 0:\n                    ways = nCr(rest_zeros + rest_ones, rest_zeros)\n                    ans = (ans + ways) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n    else:\n        ans = 0\n        for t in range(1, k+1, 2):\n            zeros_needed = (t + 1) // 2\n            ones_needed = t // 2\n            if zeros_needed <= n and ones_needed <= m:\n                rest_zeros = n - zeros_needed\n                rest_ones = m - ones_needed\n                if rest_zeros >= 0 and rest_ones >= 0:\n                    ways = nCr(rest_zeros + rest_ones, rest_zeros)\n                    ans = (ans + ways) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `g`, representing the required number of zeros, ones, and the final character, respectively.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the total length of the string is 1, the solution directly checks if the counts of zeros and ones match the required values and outputs 1 or 0 accordingly.\n3. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorial and inverse factorial arrays up to 200,000 to efficiently compute binomial coefficients using modular arithmetic.\n4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: Depending on whether `g` is 0 or 1, the code calculates the number of valid sequences of operations.
