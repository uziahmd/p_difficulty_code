Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any newline characters) to get the required letters.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the required string and in the pile string.\n\n Alternatively, we can sort both strings and then compare.\n\n Since the length is at most 100, sorting is efficient.\n\n Example:\n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined required: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But note: the example input has the third line as the pile. However, the example output is \"YES\", meaning the pile has exactly the same letters.\n\n However, wait: the example input provided in the note is given as a list of three strings, but the actual input is three separate lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example 1:\n     Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n     Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n     Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example output is YES. However, let me check:\n\n   Required letters: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (without spaces) -> length = 12 + 8 = 20\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> length is 16? \n\n   Actually, let me count:\n     SANTACLAUS: 11 letters? (S A N T A C L A U S -> 10? because there are two A's and two S's? Actually: S(2), A(3), N(1), T(1), C(1), L(1), U(1) -> but wait, let me write it out:\n\n   Correction: \n        SANTACLAUS: \n          S: 2, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1 -> total 10 letters.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as: \n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n   Actually, the example input is three lines. The first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", second is \"DEDMOROZ\", third is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Let me compute the required letters: \n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters\n        Total: 18 letters.\n\n   Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count:\n        S: appears in SANTA (2) and then again? \n        Actually, let me write: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n        Counting: \n          S: 3\n          A: 3\n          N: 1\n          T: 1\n          M: 1\n          O: 2\n          R: 1\n          Z: 1\n          D: 2\n          E: 1\n          C: 1\n          L: 1\n          U: 1\n\n   That doesn't match the required. \n\n   Wait, the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input: \n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   So what's the correct combined string? The example says the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n   Actually, the example says: \"In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\"\n\n   Let me recompute the required letters:\n\n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> letters: S, A, N",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters required for both names combined.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires verifying that the pile contains exactly the same letters as the concatenation of the guest's name and the host's name, with no extra or missing letters. This means every letter in the combined names must be present in the pile with at least the same frequency, and there should be no letters left in the pile after forming both names.\n2. **Intuition**: By comparing the sorted list of characters from the combined names and the sorted list of characters from the pile, we can efficiently check if they are identical. If they are, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves reading the three input lines, combining the first two into a target string, and then comparing the sorted characters of the target string with the sorted characters of the pile string. This comparison ensures that both the letters and their frequencies match exactly.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves sorting the characters of two strings. Given that each string's length does not exceed 100 characters, the sorting operation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the string. This is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    combined_required = guest_name + host_name\n    \n    if sorted(combined_required) == sorted(pile_letters):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string (`combined_required`), which represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Comparison**: The code sorts the characters of `combined_required` and the pile of letters. If the sorted lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters (and their counts) to form both names, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the comparison, the result is printed, indicating whether the pile can be used to reconstruct the names or not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters and their frequencies between the combined names and the pile, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
