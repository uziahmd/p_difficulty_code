You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj.

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits, but each digit from s can be used only once.\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n We have two strings: \n   a: the original number (as string) of length n.\n   s: the sequence of digits (as string) of length m.\n\n Since we can use each digit in s at most once, we can choose at most m replacements.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to skip some operations. We want to maximize the number.\n\n Strategy:\n\n We cannot simply replace the leftmost digits arbitrarily because sometimes replacing a digit with a lower digit might be forced if we don't have a good digit? Actually, we want to increase the number as much as possible.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are allowed to replace any digit in a with a digit from s, but we cannot break the order of s (but note: the problem says each element in s can be used at most once, and we can choose any position in a for each digit from s? Actually, the problem says: \"each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation\", meaning we can use each digit only once, but the order in s does not matter for assignment? Actually, the problem does not specify that the digits must be used in order. So we can assign the available digits arbitrarily to positions.\n\n 2. Therefore, we can collect all the digits from s and sort them in descending order? But wait: we are allowed to choose which positions to replace. \n\n 3. However, note: We are trying to maximize the number. So we should try to replace digits from left to right first because a digit in an earlier position has a higher weight.\n\n 4. We have a fixed set of replacement digits (from s). We can use each at most once.\n\n Approach:\n\n - Let's consider that we can replace a digit at a certain position i only if the replacement digit is greater than the current digit.\n\n - But note: we are allowed to use the same replacement digit only once, so we need to allocate the best available digits to the leftmost positions.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  Step 1: We want to replace some digits in a to get a larger number.\n\n  Step 2: We can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n    We are going to traverse the digits of a from left to right (most significant first).\n\n    For each digit in a (from left to right), we want to see if we can replace it with a digit from s that is greater than the current digit. But note: we can also choose to not replace if we don't have a better digit? However, if we replace a digit with a lower one, the number becomes smaller. So we only consider replacements that use a digit from s that is greater than the current digit.\n\n    But here is the catch: we have a multiset of digits in s. We can use each only once.\n\n    However, we are allowed to use the replacements arbitrarily. So we can:\n\n      - Collect all the digits from s and store them in a list (or multiset) and sort them in descending order? Or perhaps we can use a max-heap? But note: we have up to 10^5 digits.\n\n    But note: we are going to use the largest available digits first for the leftmost positions. However, we must consider that we might have multiple digits in s that are large, but we cannot use the same digit twice.\n\n  Step 3: However, we are not forced to use the largest digit for the first position. We might have:\n\n      Example: \n        a = \"1024\", s = \"010\"\n\n      But note: the example input: \n          Input: ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n      Output: \n          '1124'\n          '987'\n\n      Explanation for first example:\n        We can use the two '1's from s to replace the first two digits? But wait, the original first digit is '1'. Replacing the first digit with '1' doesn't change it. Then we can replace the second digit (which is '0') with '1' to get '1124'.\n\n      But what if we have:\n\n        a = \"123\", s = \"987\"\n\n        Then we can replace the first digit: we have '9','8','7' -> the best is 9, so we get \"923\", then we can replace the next with 8 -> \"983\", then with 7 -> \"987\". But wait, the example output for the second test case is just \"987\", so we are allowed to use all the digits.\n\n      However, note: the problem says \"each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation\", so we can use each digit at most once, but we are allowed to use a subset.\n\n  Step 4: Algorithm:\n\n    We want to maximize the number. We can do:\n\n      Let available = sorted(s, reverse=True)   # But we don't want to use too many if they are not beneficial? Actually, we can use a greedy: we want to use the largest available digits on the leftmost positions that are less than the current digit? Actually, we can replace a digit with a larger one to increase the number.\n\n      However, we can only replace if the replacement digit is larger? Actually, no: we can also replace a digit with a smaller one, but that would make the number smaller. Why would we do that? The problem is to maximize the number, so we should avoid that.\n\n      Therefore, we only consider replacements that yield a larger digit.\n\n    But wait: what if we don't have a digit that is larger for the first position, but we have a digit that is larger for the second? Then we should replace the first with the next best? No, because the first digit is the most significant.\n\n    However, consider:\n\n        a = \"123\", s = \"0\"\n\n        We cannot make the first digit larger, so we leave it. Then the second digit is '2', we can replace with '0'? That would make the number \"103\" which is worse than \"123\". So we don't do that.\n\n    Therefore, we only replace when the replacement digit is strictly greater than the current digit?\n\n    Actually, note: the problem says \"maximum value\". So if we can get a larger digit, we do. But if we cannot, then we leave the digit.\n\n    However, there is a nuance: sometimes we might want to save a big digit for a later position even if we can replace a digit in the current position with a slightly bigger one? Actually, no: because the leftmost positions are the most significant.\n\n    So plan:\n\n      Step 1: We are going to have a multiset (or sorted list) of the digits in s, but we want to use the largest ones first for the leftmost positions.\n\n      Step 2: We traverse the digits of a from left to right.\n\n      Step 3: For the current digit, we look for the largest digit in s that is greater than the current digit. If we find one, we replace the current digit with that digit, remove that digit from the multiset, and continue.\n\n      But wait: what if we have multiple replacements? We are allowed to use the entire multiset arbitrarily. However, we must use each digit at most once.\n\n      However, the above greedy uses one replacement per digit and we use the largest available that is greater than the current digit. But what if we don't use a digit that is greater than the current digit? Then we leave the digit and move on. But then we might have a situation where a later digit could be replaced by a digit that is not the largest, but we saved the largest for a later position? Actually, no: because we are processing from left to right and we are using the largest available digit that is greater than the current one. But note: we might have a digit that is greater than the current one but not the absolute largest. However, we want to maximize the overall number.\n\n      Actually, the standard way is:\n\n        We want to replace the leftmost digits that we can with the best available digits (even if the best available digit is not the maximum overall, but the maximum that is greater than the current one). But we are allowed to use the entire multiset arbitrarily.\n\n      However, consider:\n\n        a = \"123\", s = \"99\"\n\n        We have two 9s. We can replace the first digit with 9 -> \"923\", then the second digit with 9 -> \"993\". But note: we are allowed to use each digit only once, so we can use both.\n\n        But if we have:\n\n        a = \"123\", s = \"98\"\n\n        Then we replace the first digit with 9 -> \"923\", then the second digit with 8 -> \"983\".\n\n        Now, what if:\n\n        a = \"123\", s = \"91\"\n\n        Then we can replace the first digit with 9 -> \"923\", but then we have a 1. We cannot use the 1 to replace the second digit because 1 < 2. So we leave the second digit. Alternatively, we could replace the second digit with 1? But that would give \"913\", which is 913 vs 923 -> 923 is bigger.\n\n        So we only replace if the replacement digit is greater than the current one.\n\n      Step 4: Implementation:\n\n        We need to quickly get the largest digit in s that is greater than the current digit, and then remove it.\n\n        But note: the length of a is up to 10^5, and the length of s is up to 10^5, and we are going to do at most 10^5 replacements.\n\n        We cannot do a linear scan for each digit (because worst-case 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline? But note: worst-case, we might have to search 10^5 elements for each of the 10^5 digits -> 10^10 operations, which is too slow in Python.\n\n      Alternative: Preprocess the multiset s.\n\n        We can use a sorted list and then use binary search? But removal from a sorted list is O(n). Or we can use a balanced BST? In Python, we can use a sorted list and the bisect module, but removal is O(n). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a max-heap? But we need to get the largest digit that is <= a threshold? Actually, we want the largest digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n        Another idea: use a frequency array for the digits (since digits are from '0' to '9').\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let freq = [0]*10\n          For each digit in s: \n              d = int(digit)\n              freq[d] += 1\n\n          Then we can iterate from the current digit+1 to 9, and check if there is any digit available.\n\n          But wait: we are traversing from left to right. We want to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one.\n\n          However, we are going to use one occurrence of that digit and then update the frequency.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to use the same digit multiple times (if it appears multiple times) until we use all occurrences.\n\n          Example: s = \"99\", then we have two 9s.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            For each position i in a (from left to right):\n                current_digit = int(a[i])\n                # We want the largest digit d (from 9 down to current_digit+1) such that freq[d] > 0.\n                candidate = None\n                for d in range(current_digit+1, 10):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        candidate = d\n                        break\n\n                If candidate is found:\n                    Then we replace the current digit with candidate, and decrement freq[candidate] by 1.\n                Else:\n                    We leave the digit, and move on.\n\n          But is this correct?\n\n          Example: \n            a = \"123\", s = \"98\"\n            freq: initially {9:1, 8:1} (for digits 0-9, we set others to 0)\n\n            i=0: current_digit=1. We look for d from 2 to 9: first is 9 -> candidate=9. Replace with 9, then freq[9]=0.\n            i=1: current_digit=2. We look for d from 3 to 9: first is 8 (since 3 to 7 are 0, then 8:1) -> candidate=8. Replace with 8, then freq[8]=0.\n            Result: \"983\"\n\n          Example: \n            a = \"123\", s = \"91\"\n            i=0: current_digit=1 -> candidate=9. Replace with 9, freq[9]=0, freq[1]=1 (but we didn't use the 1).\n            i=1: current_digit=2 -> look for d from 3 to 9: nothing (freq[3..9] are 0) -> skip.\n            Result: \"923\"\n\n          But wait, what if we have:\n\n            a = \"123\", s = \"90\"\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> candidate=9. Then replace with 9 -> \"923\", then for the second digit, we have 0. But we don't use 0 because 0<2. Then third digit: 3, we have nothing.\n\n          This seems correct.\n\n          However, consider:\n\n            a = \"123\", s = \"90\", but what if we don't use the 9 at the first position? Then we can use the 0 at the second? But that would be worse. So we want to use the 9 at the first.\n\n          But what if we have:\n\n            a = \"155\", s = \"91\"\n\n            Option1: \n                i0: current_digit=1 -> candidate=9. Then we get \"955\", and then the rest are 5 and we don't have any digit greater than 5 (we have 1 left, but 1<5). Result: \"955\"\n\n            Option2: \n                What if we don't use the 9 at the first, and use the 1 at the second? Then we get \"155\" -> replace the second digit: 1>5? No, so we don't. Then we get \"155\". But wait, we have the digit '1' from s. We can use it on the third digit? 1<5, so no. Then we get \"155\", which is worse than \"955\".\n\n          So the greedy is correct.\n\n          However, consider:\n\n            a = \"149\", s = \"98\"\n\n            We want to maximize:\n\n            Option: \n                First digit: 1 -> replace with 9 -> \"949\", then second digit: 4 -> replace with 8 -> \"989\". This is better.\n\n            But if we do:\n\n                i0: current_digit=1 -> candidate=9 (available). Replace with 9 -> freq[9] becomes 0.\n                i1: current_digit=4 -> candidate=8 (available). Replace with 8 -> freq[8] becomes 0.\n\n            Result: \"989\"\n\n            Alternatively, if we didn't use the 9 at the first, then we could use the 8 at the first? Then we get \"849\", then use the 9 at the second: 9>4 -> \"899\", which is 899 vs 989 -> 989 is bigger.\n\n            So the greedy (using the largest available digit for the current position) is correct because the leftmost digit is the most significant.\n\n          But wait: what if we have two digits to replace and two digits in s, but the largest digit is not the best for the first position? Actually, the first position is the most significant. We want the highest digit at the front.\n\n          However, consider:\n\n            a = \"199\", s = \"91\"\n\n            Option1: \n                First digit: 1 -> replace with 9 -> \"999\", then we have 1 left. The second digit is 9, 1<9 -> skip. Third digit 9, 1<9 -> skip. Result: \"999\"\n\n            Option2: \n                What if we don't replace the first digit? Then we have the 1. Then we can replace the second digit with 9 -> \"199\" becomes \"199\" (no change) and then the third digit with 9 -> \"199\" becomes \"199\" (no change) and then we have the 1: we can replace the first digit? But wait, we didn't use the 9 for the first. But then we have two 9s and one 1. We can use the 9 for the first: then we get \"999\". So the greedy works.\n\n          However, note: we are using the 9 for the first and then the 1 is left. We don't use the 1 because it doesn't help.\n\n          But what if:\n\n            a = \"149\", s = \"89\"\n\n            Option: \n                First digit: 1 -> candidate=9 (available). Then we replace with 9 -> \"949\", then second digit: 4 -> candidate=8 (available). Then we replace with 8 -> \"989\".\n\n            Without the 9, we could use the 8 for the first: then \"849\", then use the 9 for the second: \"899\". But 989 > 899.\n\n          Therefore, the greedy is correct.\n\n          But note: what if we have multiple same digits? We need to account for frequency.\n\n          Example: \n            a = \"111\", s = \"999\"\n\n            We have three 9s. We will replace the first 1 with 9, then the second 1 with 9, then the third 1 with 9 -> \"999\"\n\n          Example: \n            a = \"111\", s = \"987\"\n\n            We have three digits: 9,8,7. We will replace the first 1 with 9, then the second 1 with 8, then the third 1 with 7 -> \"987\"\n\n          However, what if:\n\n            a = \"111\", s = \"910\"\n\n            We have: 9,1,0.\n\n            For the first digit: 1 -> candidate=9. Then we use 9 -> \"911\", then we have 1 and 0. For the second digit: 1 -> candidate: nothing (because 1 is not greater than 1, and the next is 0). Similarly for the third.\n\n            Result: \"911\"\n\n          But wait, we have a 1 and 0. We cannot use the 1 or 0 to replace the second digit because they are <=1. So that's correct.\n\n          However, consider:\n\n            a = \"155\", s = \"90\"\n\n            As above, we get \"955\". But wait, we have a 0 in s. We didn't use the 0 because it is less than 5. But we don't care about digits that are not greater.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily, but we only use them if they are greater? Actually, we are not forced to use the digits. We can skip.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Read a and s.\n\n            Build an array `freq` of 10 zeros (for digits 0 to 9).\n\n            For each char in s:\n                d = int(char)\n                freq[d] += 1\n\n            Then, convert a to a list of characters (or we can work on the string) and then for each index i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                current_digit = int(a[i])\n\n                # Check from 9 down to current_digit+1 (inclusive) for the largest digit available (but we break at the first available because we are going from high to low, and the first available is the largest)\n                candidate = None\n                for d in range(current_digit+1, 10):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        candidate = d\n                        break\n\n                if candidate is not None:\n                    # Replace the current digit with candidate\n                    # Convert candidate to string and put it in the result at position i.\n                    # Also, decrement freq[candidate] by 1.\n                    # But note: we are building a new string? Or we can modify the original string.\n\n                    # We can build the result as a list of characters for a, and then at the end combine.\n\n                    # Since a is given as a string, we can convert the whole a to a list of chars, then replace the i-th char with str(candidate), and then decrement the frequency of candidate.\n\n                    # But note: we are not limited by the length of a, and we are doing this for each position.\n\n            However, we cannot modify the original a during the process because we are reading from stdin. We can build a new string.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                result_chars = list(a)\n                for i in range(len(a)):\n                    current_digit = int(result_chars[i])\n                    candidate = None\n                    # Instead of iterating from current_digit+1 to 9, we can break early if we find one.\n\n                    # But note: we are using the frequency array, so we can break at the first available.\n\n                    # However, we are going from 9 down to current_digit+1? Actually, we are iterating from current_digit+1 to 9, but in increasing order. But we want the largest digit. So we should iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1.\n\n                    # Correction: we want the largest digit that is greater than current_digit. The largest digit is 9, then 8, then ... down to current_digit+1.\n\n                    # So we should iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1.\n\n                    # Change the loop:\n\n                    candidate = None\n                    for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                        if freq[d] > 0:\n                            candidate = d\n                            break\n\n                    if candidate is not None:\n                        # Replace the i-th character\n                        result_chars[i] = str(candidate)\n                        freq[candidate] -= 1\n\n                Then, output ''.join(result_chars)\n\n          Let's test with the example: a=\"1024\", s=\"010\"\n\n            freq: \n                for s=\"010\": \n                  0:2, 1:1, others:0.\n\n            We start with a='1024'\n\n            i0: current_digit=1. We look from 9 down to 2: nothing? Then from 9 down to 2: we check 9,8,...,2 -> none. Then candidate=None -> leave as '1'\n\n            i1: current_digit=0. We look from 9 down to 1: \n                9:0 -> skip, 8:0, ... 2:0, 1:1 -> candidate=1. Then replace the second digit (which is '0') with '1'. Then update freq[1] to 0.\n\n            i2: current_digit=2. We look from 9 down to 3: nothing. Then leave as '2'\n\n            i3: current_digit=4. We look from 9 down to 5: nothing. Then leave as '4'\n\n            Result: \"1124\"\n\n          But wait, the example input was given as two examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"1024\" and \"010\" -> \"1124\"\n\n            Example 2: \"987\" and \"1234567\" -> \"987\"\n\n          For example 2:\n\n            a = \"987\", s = \"1234567\"\n\n            We have a multiset of s: digits from 1 to 7, each one time.\n\n            We start with a='987'\n\n            i0: current_digit=9. We look from 9 down to 10 -> but 9 is included? Actually, we are looking from 9 down to 9 (since current_digit=9, then we look from 9 down to 10? Wait, our loop is from 9 down to current_digit+1? \n\n            Correction: in our code above, the loop is for d in range(9, current_digit, -1). \n\n            But current_digit=9: then the range is from 9 down to 10 (exclusive of 9? Actually, the range function in Python: range(9, 9, -1) produces no numbers. \n\n            So we don't find any candidate for the first digit.\n\n            Then we leave it as '9'. Then the second digit: current_digit=8, we look from 9 down to 9 (since 8+1=9). We check 9: available? We have one 9 in s? No, because s doesn't contain 9. It contains 1 to 7. So no. Then leave as '8'. Then third digit: 7, we look from 9 down to 8: nothing. Leave as '7'.\n\n            Result: \"987\", which matches.\n\n          But wait, why didn't we use the digits 1 to 7? Because they are all less than or equal to the corresponding digits in a? \n\n            For the first digit: we need a digit >9 -> none.\n            For the second digit: we need a digit >8 -> none (since max is 7).\n            For the third digit: we need a digit >7 -> none.\n\n          So we don't use any.\n\n          However, consider:\n\n            a = \"111\", s = \"111\"\n\n            Then we have three 1s.\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> we look from 9 down to 2 -> nothing. So we leave it as 1.\n            i1: current_digit=1 -> nothing.\n            i2: current_digit=1 -> nothing.\n\n            Result: \"111\"\n\n          But wait, we have three 1s. We are allowed to use them. However, we cannot replace a digit with 1 if the current digit is 1 because 1 is not greater than 1. So we don't replace.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, what if:\n\n            a = \"111\", s = \"222\"\n\n            Then we have three 2s.\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> we look from 9 down to 2: the first is 2. Then we replace with 2, and update freq[2] to 2.\n            i1: current_digit=1 -> candidate=2 -> replace with 2, update freq[2] to 1.\n            i2: current_digit=1 -> candidate=2 -> replace with 2, update freq[2] to 0.\n\n            Result: \"222\"\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: what if we have:\n\n            a = \"199\", s = \"2\"\n\n            Then we have one 2.\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> candidate=2 (since 2>1). Then replace the first digit with 2 -> \"299\", and then we have no more digits.\n\n            Then the rest: i1: current_digit=9 -> no digit greater than 9. i2: current_digit=9 -> no.\n\n            Result: \"299\"\n\n          However, what if we don't replace the first digit? Then we can replace the second digit? But the second digit is 9, and 2<9 -> no. Similarly the third. So we must use the 2 on the first digit.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            n = len(a_string)\n            m = len(s_string)\n\n            # Build frequency array for digits 0-9\n            freq = [0]*10\n            for char in s_string:\n                d = int(char)\n                freq[d] += 1\n\n            # Convert a_string to list of characters for mutation\n            res_list = list(a_string)\n\n            # Traverse each digit in a_string\n            for i in range(len(res_list)):\n                current_digit = int(res_list[i])\n                # We are going to look for the largest digit from 9 down to current_digit+1\n                candidate = None\n                # Note: current_digit is from 0 to 9. We consider digits from 9 down to current_digit+1 (inclusive of current_digit+1, exclusive of current_digit)\n                for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        candidate = d\n                        break\n\n                if candidate is not None:\n                    res_list[i] = str(candidate)\n                    freq[candidate] -= 1\n\n            print(''.join(res_list))\n\n          However, note: the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. And the output shouldn't contain leading zeroes.\n\n          Our algorithm does not produce leading zeroes because we are replacing the first digit only if we have a digit greater than the first digit (which is non-zero) and even if we replace with a zero, that would be if the current_digit is negative? But the first digit is at least 1 (since no leading zero). \n\n          But wait: what if the original number is \"0\"? The problem says positive integer a, so no.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"positive integer a\", so the first digit is at least 1.\n\n          However, what if we replace the first digit with 0? Then we get a leading zero. But we only replace if the candidate digit is greater than the current_digit. Since the first digit is at least 1, and we are replacing with a digit from 2 to 9 (if candidate exists) or if candidate is 0 then we wouldn't use it because 0 is less than the first digit (which is at least 1). \n\n          But wait: our algorithm only replaces if the candidate is greater than the current_digit. So if the current_digit is 1, and we have a candidate 0, we don't use it. \n\n          However, what if the current_digit is 0? Then we look for digits from 9 down to 1. Then we use the largest digit available that is greater than 0. But the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, so the first digit is not zero. However, if the number has more than one digit, then there might be zeros in the middle or at the end.\n\n          Example: a = \"10\", s = \"0\"\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> we look for digits from 9 down to 2: none. Then leave as 1.\n            i1: current_digit=0 -> we look for digits from 9 down to 1: none. Then leave as 0.\n\n            Result: \"10\"\n\n          But wait, what if we have:\n\n            a = \"10\", s = \"0\"\n\n            We are allowed to use the 0? But 0 is not greater than 0, so we don't use it.\n\n          Another example: a = \"0\", but the problem says positive integer, so we don't have to consider.\n\n          One more edge: if the entire string is replaced by zeros? But we only replace if the candidate is greater than the current_digit. The current_digit is at least 0, and the candidate must be at least 1 to be greater than 0. So we never replace a digit with 0 if the current_digit is 0? Actually, if the current_digit is 0, then we require a digit greater than 0, so we don't use 0. But if the current_digit is 1, we don't use 0 either.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is safe.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the sequence s can have zeros, but we only use zeros if they are greater than the current_digit. Since zeros are 0, they are only greater than negative digits, which we don't have. So zeros are never used.\n\n          But wait: if the current_digit is -1? No, we are dealing with non-negative digits.\n\n          Therefore, the code:\n\n            a_str = input().strip()\n            s_str = input().strip()\n\n            # Build frequency array for digits 0-9\n            freq = [0]*10\n            for char in s_str:\n                d = int(char)\n                if d < 0 or d > 9:\n                    # The problem states digits, so we assume 0-9.\n                    continue\n                freq[d] += 1\n\n            # Convert a_str to list of characters\n            res_list = list(a_str)\n\n            # Traverse each digit in the number\n            for i in range(len(res_list)):\n                current_digit = int(res_list[i])\n                # We are going to look for the largest digit from 9 down to current_digit+1\n                candidate = None\n                # We'll iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1\n                # Note: current_digit is an integer between 0 and 9.\n                for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        candidate = d\n                        break\n\n                if candidate is not None:\n                    res_list[i] = str(candidate)\n                    freq[candidate] -= 1\n\n            print(''.join(res_list))\n\n          Let me test with provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: \n                a_str = \"1024\"\n                s_str = \"010\"\n\n            Expected: \"1124\"\n\n          Example 2:\n            Input:\n                a_str = \"987\"\n                s_str = \"1234567\"\n\n            Expected: \"987\"\n\n          Example 3:\n            Input:\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"987\"\n\n            Expected: \"987\"\n\n          Example 4:\n            Input:\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"91\"\n\n            Expected: \"923\"\n\n          Example 5:\n            Input:\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"90\"\n\n            Expected: \"955\" ? Wait, no: \n                Original: \"123\"\n                After replacing first digit with 9: \"923\", then the second digit is 2, we don't have a digit greater than 2 (we have 0, which is less) so we leave it. Then third digit: 3, we don't have a digit greater than 3. So result: \"923\"\n\n          But wait, the example above said \"a = '123', s='90'\" -> \"923\", but then I thought we got \"955\", that was a mistake.\n\n          However, wait: the example above was a=\"123\", s=\"90\", and we replaced the first digit with 9, so we get \"923\", but the third digit is 3 and we have a 0, so we don't replace. Correct.\n\n          But wait, what if we have:\n\n            a = \"123\", s = \"0\"\n\n            Then we don't use the 0 because 0<1 and 0<2 and 0<3. So we output \"123\"\n\n          All tests pass.\n\n          However, note: the problem constraints say that the length of a and s can be up to 10^5. \n\n          The inner loop runs at most 9 - current_digit steps. Since current_digit is between 0 and 9, the inner loop runs at most 9 steps (from 9 down to 1). So the total operations is O(n * 9) which is O(9*n) ~ 900000, which is acceptable.\n\n          But wait, we are building a frequency array of size 10, and updating it. The memory is O(1) for the frequency array.\n\n          Therefore, the code is efficient.\n\n          Let me run the provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: \n            a_str = \"1024\", s_str = \"010\"\n\n            freq: \n                Initially: [0]*10\n                Then for s_str \"010\": \n                    '0':0 -> freq[0]=2\n                    '1':1 -> freq[1]=1\n                    '0':0 -> freq[0]=3? Wait, wait: we did two zeros and one one.\n\n            Correction: \n                s_str = \"010\" -> three characters: '0','1','0'\n                So we do:\n                    d=0: freq[0]=1\n                    d=1: freq[1]=1\n                    d=0: freq[0]=2\n\n            Then we process:\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> look from 9 down to 2: nothing. So no replacement.\n            i1: current_digit=0 -> look from 9 down to 1: 9,8,...,1 -> we find 1 (freq[1]=1). Then replace the second digit (which is '0') with '1'. Then update: freq[1]=0.\n\n            Then the string becomes ['1','1','2','4'] -> \"1124\"\n\n          Example 2: \n            a_str=\"987\", s_str=\"1234567\"\n\n            freq: for digits 1 to 7: each 1, others 0.\n\n            i0: current_digit=9",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that to maximize the number, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible digits from the sequence, as these positions have the highest significance in the number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Frequency Array Setup**: We first create a frequency array to count occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the provided sequence. This helps in efficiently checking the availability of digits for replacement.\n2. **Greedy Replacement**: We process each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, we look for the largest digit available in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If found, we replace the current digit with this largest available digit and decrement its count in the frequency array.\n3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks for the largest available digit in constant time (since digits range from 0 to 9) for each position in the number, making the overall complexity O(n), where n is the length of the number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    freq = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        d = int(char)\n        if 0 <= d <= 9:\n            freq[d] += 1\n            \n    res_list = list(a_str)\n    \n    for i in range(len(res_list)):\n        current_digit = int(res_list[i])\n        candidate = None\n        for d_val in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n            if freq[d_val] > 0:\n                candidate = d_val\n                break\n                \n        if candidate is not None:\n            res_list[i] = str(candidate)\n            freq[candidate] -= 1\n            \n    print(''.join(res_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the original number and the sequence of digits from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Array Initialization**: A frequency array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) is initialized to zero. Each digit in the sequence is processed to update the frequency array.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, the code checks for the largest digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If such a digit is found, it replaces the current digit and updates the frequency array.\n4. **Output**: The modified number, after all possible replacements, is printed as a string.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is maximized by leveraging the highest possible digits from the sequence for the most significant positions first, thus optimizing the overall value of the number. The use of a frequency array allows for efficient digit lookup and management during the replacement process.",
