Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burnt candles (which become old) to make more new ones.\n\n Steps:\n   We start by lighting all the new candles we have. Then we burn them and get some old candles.\n\n But note: we can also use the old candles to make more new ones, which then can be burned to give even more old ones.\n\n We can simulate:\n   hours = 0\n   new = a\n   old = 0\n\n   while new > 0:\n        # Burn all the new candles\n        hours += new\n        old += new\n        new = 0   # because we burned all the new ones\n\n        # Now, we can convert old candles into new ones\n        # How many new ones? old // b\n        new = old // b\n        # The leftover old candles (old % b) remain\n        old = old % b\n\n   Then print hours.\n\n However, note: the problem says that when we make a new candle from b old ones, that new candle is available for burning in the next cycle.\n\n But wait, the example: \n     Input: \"4 2\"\n        Hours 1-4: burn 4 new candles -> now we have 4 old candles.\n        Then we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and leftover 0.\n        Then we burn these 2 new candles -> hours 5 and 6 -> total 6 hours so far.\n        Then from the 2 old candles (from the last burn) we cannot make a new one (because 2 < 2? Actually, no: we need b=2, so 2//2=1, and then we have 0 leftover.\n        Then we burn the 1 new candle -> hour 7. Then we have 1 old candle (from that last burn) and we don't have enough for a new one.\n\n        So total hours = 7.\n\n But our simulation above:\n\n        Start: new=4, old=0, hours=0\n        Step1: burn 4 -> hours=4, old=4, then new = 4//2 = 2, old = 4%2=0 -> now new=2, old=0.\n        Step2: burn 2 -> hours=6, old=2, then new = 2//2 = 1, old=0 -> now new=1, old=0.\n        Step3: burn 1 -> hours=7, old=1, then new=1//2=0, old=1 -> then loop ends.\n\n        So we get 7.\n\n However, let's try with the second sample: \"6 3\"\n        Start: new=6, old=0, hours=0\n        Step1: burn 6 -> hours=6, old=6, new = 6//3=2, old=6%3=0 -> new=2, old=0.\n        Step2: burn 2 -> hours=8, old=2, new=2//3=0, old=2 -> loop ends.\n\n        So total hours=8.\n\n This matches.\n\n But note: we are burning the new candles at the beginning of the cycle. However, the problem does not require us to separate the burning and the recycling arbitrarily.\n\n Alternatively, we can also think of it as:\n\n        total = a\n        while total >= b:\n            hours += total // b * 1   # but wait, actually we burn the total new candles and then recycle, but note that the burned ones are the same as the new ones we just burned?\n            Actually, we burn all the new ones, then we get that many old ones, then we convert old ones to new ones.\n\n        However, note that the entire process is:\n\n            Let x0 = a (initial new candles)\n            Then after burning: we get x0 old candles, then we convert floor(x0 / b) to new candles, and the leftover is x0 % b.\n\n            Then we have x1 = floor(x0 / b) new candles to burn next.\n\n            Then we burn x1, so we get x1 old candles, then convert floor(x1 / b) to new, etc.\n\n        So the total hours is the sum of all the new candles we ever had (because each new candle burns for one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for exactly one hour, and after burning, it becomes an old candle. These old candles can be combined to form new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of new candles (a) and no old candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: Each iteration involves burning all available new candles. The number of hours increases by the number of new candles burned.\n3. **Recycling Old Candles**: After burning, the old candles (which are equal to the number of new candles just burned) are collected. These old candles are then converted into new candles at a rate of b old candles per new candle. The remaining old candles (if any) are kept for future recycling.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are not enough old candles to form even one new candle (i.e., the number of old candles is less than b).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring that we account for all possible hours of illumination by leveraging the recycled candles optimally.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    hours = 0\n    old = 0\n    while a > 0:\n        hours += a\n        old += a\n        a = old // b\n        old = old % b\n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of new candles) and `b` (number of old candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `hours` is initialized to zero to keep track of the total burning time. `old` is initialized to zero to accumulate the number of old candles.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles (`a > 0`):\n   - **Burning Phase**: In each iteration, all available new candles (`a`) are burned, adding their count to `hours`.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The burnt candles are added to the `old` count. These old candles are then converted into new candles (`a = old // b`), and the remaining old candles (`old % b`) are stored for future use.\n4. **Output**: Once no more new candles can be formed, the loop exits, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by continuously recycling old candles into new ones, maximizing the total illumination time. The solution handles all edge cases, including when no new candles can be formed immediately, ensuring optimal performance.",
