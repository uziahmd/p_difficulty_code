There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights with constraints.\n However, the restrictions are given as \"tallest house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\", and we have multiple restrictions.\n\n Idea: \n We are to assign a height for each spot (from 0 to h) such that for each restriction i, the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n We note that the profit is the sum of squares of the heights. So we want to set as high as possible without violating the restrictions.\n\n But the restrictions might conflict. We need to satisfy all.\n\n Since the number of spots is small (n<=50) but the state space of heights is (h+1) which is up to 51, and we have m<=50, we cannot iterate over all assignments (51^50) so we must use DP.\n\n However, note that the constraints are about ranges and the maximum allowed in a range. Another idea: use constraint propagation.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what is the maximum height we can assign to each spot? \n\n But the restrictions are overlapping. We can consider:\n\n Let A[1..n] be the heights we choose.\n\n Conditions: For each restriction i: max{A[l_i..r_i]} <= x_i.\n\n Also, for each spot j, A[j] <= h.\n\n The goal is to maximize sum_{j=1}^{n} A[j]^2.\n\n Observation: The function f(a)=a^2 is convex and increasing for a>=0. So we want to set each house as high as possible, but the constraints might force some houses to be lower.\n\n How to enforce the constraints? We have m restrictions. Each restriction is a condition on a contiguous segment.\n\n We can try to use DP that considers the positions and the \"current\" maximum in segments that end at this position? But the restrictions are arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a two-step approach:\n\n Step 1: Precompute the minimum required maximum for each segment? Actually, we know the restrictions: if a restriction says the segment [l, r] must have maximum <= x, then no house in [l, r] can exceed x.\n\n But multiple restrictions might impose different maximums on the same house. For a given house j, the maximum height it can have is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover j.\n\n However, wait: that is not necessarily correct. Consider: \n   Restriction 1: [1,3] must have max <= 5.\n   Restriction 2: [2,4] must have max <= 3.\n\n Then house 2 is covered by both: so its height must be <= min(5,3)=3. Similarly, house 1 is only in restriction1 -> <=5, house3 is in both -> <=3, house4 is only in restriction2 -> <=3.\n\n But is that sufficient? Yes, because if we set each house to the minimum of h and the minimum x_i covering it, then any segment will have maximum <= the minimum x_i in the restrictions covering that segment? \n\n Actually, no: consider if we set each house independently to the minimum x_i from the restrictions that cover it (then capped by h), then a segment might have a house that is set to a value that is the minimum x_i for that house, but the restriction for the segment might require that the entire segment's maximum is <= x_i. But note: if we set each house to at most the minimum x_i for the restrictions that cover it, then the entire segment [l_i, r_i] would have all houses <= (the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover the entire segment?) Not exactly: the house might be constrained by a different restriction that is not the one defining the segment.\n\n However, note: we must satisfy every restriction. For a given restriction i, the entire segment [l_i, r_i] must have max <= x_i. Therefore, each house j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So for house j, the maximum height is the minimum of:\n   h, and the minimum x_i from all restrictions that include j.\n\n Let M(j) = min{ h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i }\n\n Then, if we set house j to M(j), then we satisfy all restrictions? \n\n Why? For any restriction i, the segment [l_i, r_i] has all houses j in [l_i, r_i] with height <= M(j) <= min_{k covering j} x_k. But note: restriction i requires that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. However, if M(j) for j in [l_i, r_i] is defined using the minimum x_i over all restrictions covering j, then we have M(j) <= x_i (because restriction i covers j and so x_i is one of the values considered in M(j)). Therefore, the entire segment [l_i, r_i] will have all houses <= x_i, so the maximum is <= x_i.\n\n However, is this the best we can do? Because we might set a house lower than M(j) to allow other houses to be higher? But note: the profit function is separable and convex. We want to set each house as high as possible. And if we set a house below M(j), then we might be able to set another house higher? But wait, the restrictions are independent per segment. However, setting a house to M(j) is the maximum allowed by the restrictions. Therefore, we cannot set it higher. And if we set it lower, we don't gain anything because the square function is increasing. So why set it lower?\n\n But wait: what if two restrictions overlap and we set one house to a lower value to relax a constraint for the neighboring house? However, note that the constraints are on contiguous segments. Since the square function is strictly convex, we want to set each house as high as possible. And the above assignment sets each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions. Therefore, the total profit is fixed by the assignment: set each house j to M(j).\n\n However, let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n   Compute M(1): min(3, min{ x_i for restrictions covering 1 }) = min(3,1) = 1.\n   M(2): min(3, min{3}) = 3.\n   M(3): min(3, min{2}) = 2.\n\n   Then the assignment is [1,3,2] -> profit 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n   For house1: not covered by any restriction -> M(1)=min(10, min{}) -> but how to handle min{}? We define M(j) = min(h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i). For house1, there are no restrictions, so we take the minimum over an empty set? That would be infinity? Then we cap by h.\n\n   So for house1: M(1)=10.\n\n   For house2: covered by first restriction -> min(10,8)=8.\n   For house3: covered by both -> min(10, min(8,7)) = 7.\n   For house4: covered by second restriction -> min(10,7)=7.\n\n   Then the assignment is [10,8,7,7] -> profit 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n This matches the example.\n\n But wait: what if there is a restriction that does not cover a house? Then that house is only limited by h. And that is correct.\n\n However, is it always optimal to set each house to M(j)? \n\n Consider: The objective is separable and the constraints are separable (each house is constrained by independent conditions). Moreover, the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers. So if we set a house to a value below M(j), we are leaving money on the table. And we cannot set it above M(j) because of the restrictions.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: For each house j (from 1 to n), compute M(j) = min(h, min_{i: l_i<=j<=r_i} x_i)\n\n   But note: the restrictions are given, and we must consider all restrictions that cover j.\n\n   Step 2: The profit is the sum for j=1 to n of (M(j))^2.\n\n However, wait: is that always the maximum? \n\n Let me test with a more complex example:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x2=3\n\n   Then M(1)=min(10, min(5,3)) = 3, M(2)=min(10, min(5,3))=3.\n   Profit = 3^2 + 3^2 = 18.\n\n   Now, is there a way to get more? \n        If we set house1=3, house2=3 -> 9+9=18.\n        If we set house1=4, then violation because restriction2 requires the entire segment [1,2] to have max<=3. So no.\n\n   Another example:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x2=3\n\n   Then M(1)=min(10,5)=5, M(2)=min(10,3)=3 -> profit 25+9=34.\n\n   Now, what if we have two restrictions that don't cover the entire street?\n\n   Example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] x1=5\n        Restriction2: [2,3] x2=3\n\n   Then:\n        M(1)=min(10,5)=5\n        M(2)=min(10,min(5,3))=3\n        M(3)=min(10,3)=3\n\n        Profit = 25+9+9 = 43.\n\n   Check the restrictions:\n        Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(5,3)=5 <=5 -> ok.\n        Restriction2: [2,3] -> max(3,3)=3 <=3 -> ok.\n\n   But wait, could we set house1 to 5, house2 to 3, house3 to 10? No, because house3 is only constrained by the second restriction (which covers [2,3]) and the second restriction says the entire segment [2,3] must be <=3. So house3 must be <=3.\n\n   So the method works.\n\n   However, wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions and we set it to the minimum x_i, but then a segment that includes that house might be forced to be lower than necessary for other parts? \n\n   Actually, the key is that the restriction for a segment [l_i, r_i] requires that the maximum in that segment is <= x_i. The method sets each house j to the minimum of h and the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover j. Then, for any segment [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that segment is at most x_i (because each house j in [l_i, r_i] is set to at most x_i, and x_i is one of the restrictions covering j). \n\n   Therefore, the constraints are satisfied.\n\n   But is it the maximum? Because if we set a house to less than M(j), then we might be able to set a house that is constrained by a different set of restrictions to a higher value? \n\n   Let me consider: \n\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x2=10\n\n        Then M(1)=5, M(2)=10 -> profit 25+100=125.\n\n        Now, what if we set house1 to 4? Then house2 can still be 10. But then profit=16+100=116 which is worse.\n\n        Another example:\n\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x2=10\n\n        Then M(1)=min(10, min(5,10)) = 5, M(2)=min(10,5)=5 -> profit 25+25=50.\n\n        But wait, if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 5, then the first restriction is satisfied (max=5<=5) and the second restriction (on house1) is satisfied (5<=10). \n\n        What if we set house1 to 10? Then the first restriction fails (max(10, house2)>=10>5). \n\n        So the method is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the restrictions are not independent? Consider:\n\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x2=3\n\n        Then M(1)=3, M(2)=3 -> profit 9+9=18.\n\n        Now, can we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 4? \n            Then the first restriction: max(3,4)=4 >5 -> violates restriction1? No, wait: the first restriction says the entire segment must be <=5, and 4<=5 so it is okay. But the second restriction says the entire segment must be <=3, and 4>3 -> violates.\n\n        So we cannot set house2 to 4.\n\n        What if we set house1 to 2 and house2 to 4?\n            Then the first restriction: max(2,4)=4<=5 -> ok.\n            The second restriction: max(2,4)=4>3 -> not ok.\n\n        What if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 3?\n            First restriction: max(4,3)=4<=5 -> ok.\n            Second restriction: max(4,3)=4>3 -> not ok.\n\n        So the only possibility is to set both to <=3. Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   Conclusion: The problem reduces to computing for each house j the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j (if there are none, then we use h). Then set the height of house j to that minimum (capped by h). Then the profit is the sum of squares.\n\n   But wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions, but the minimum x_i is not the one that appears in the set of restrictions that we have? \n\n   We are correctly taking the minimum of the x_i from all restrictions that cover j.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the restrictions are given and we must satisfy all. Our method satisfies all because for each restriction i, every house j in [l_i, r_i] is set to <= x_i (since x_i is one of the values considered for j). Therefore, the entire segment [l_i, r_i] has all houses <= x_i, so the maximum is <= x_i.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Read n, h, m.\n        Initialize an array M of length n (for spots 1 to n) with h (or maybe we start with a big number and then take min with h).\n\n        For each of the m lines:\n            l, r, x = map(int, line.split())\n            Then for each spot j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) we do:\n                M[j] = min(M[j], x)   # But note: initially M[j] is h, so we are effectively setting M[j] to the minimum x_i that covers j, unless we haven't seen any restriction? \n\n        However, wait: if we initialize M with h, then when we see a restriction we update the houses in the segment to the minimum of the current M[j] and x. But if we haven't seen a restriction that covers a house, then M[j] remains h. Then at the end, we set each house to min(M[j], h) -> but that is redundant because we started with h.\n\n        But note: the problem says the maximum height is h. So we can set a house to at most h. The restrictions might allow a lower height. Therefore, we take the minimum between the restriction's x and h.\n\n        However, in our update, we are updating M[j] to the minimum x_i (from the restrictions) and then we must cap by h. But note: we initialized M[j] to h, and then we take min(M[j], x) for each restriction. But if x is greater than h, then we keep h. But the problem says x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't have x_i > h. \n\n        Actually, input says: 0<=x_i<=h.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            For each restriction (l, r, x):\n                for j in range(l-1, r):\n                    M[j] = min(M[j], x)\n\n            Then, since we started with M[j]=h, and x<=h, then after processing, M[j] is the minimum x_i for the restrictions covering j, or h if no restriction.\n\n        Then, the height for house j is M[j] (since M[j] <= h, we don't need to cap again).\n\n        Then, profit = sum(i=0 to n-1) M[i]**2\n\n   But wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions and the minimum x_i is 0? Then we set the house to 0. That's acceptable because the square is 0.\n\n   However, let me check with the example: \n\n        Example: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction: [1,1,0]\n        Then M[0]=min(5,0)=0 -> profit 0.\n\n        Without the restriction, we could set it to 5 (profit 25). But the restriction forces 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if two restrictions on the same house: one allows 5 and one allows 3? Then M[j]=3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the restrictions are not independent? \n\n        Example: \n          n=2, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [1,1] x2=3\n\n          Then for house1: min(10, min(5,3)) = 3\n          For house2: min(10,5)=5\n\n          Then profit = 3^2 + 5^2 = 9+25=34.\n\n          Check restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(3,5)=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,1] -> 3<=3 -> ok.\n\n   But wait, what if we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 5, is there a possibility to set house2 to 6? \n        Then the first restriction: [1,2] would have max(3,6)=6>5 -> fails.\n\n   So the method holds.\n\n   However, wait: what if we set house1 to 2 and house2 to 5?\n        Then the first restriction: max(2,5)=5<=5 -> ok.\n        The second restriction: 2<=3 -> ok.\n        Profit = 4+25=29 <34.\n\n   So we want the maximum for each house.\n\n   But note: the method sets each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions. In this case, house1 is allowed to be 3, so we set it to 3. House2 is allowed to be 5, so we set it to 5.\n\n   But wait: the first restriction says the entire segment [1,2] must be <=5. The second restriction says house1 must be <=3. There's no restriction that prevents house2 from being 5, and indeed setting house1 to 3 and house2 to 5 is valid.\n\n   Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a restriction that is not the tightest one? \n\n        Example: \n          n=2, h=10, m=3\n          Restriction1: [1,2] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [1,1] x2=4\n          Restriction3: [2,2] x3=6\n\n          Then for house1: min(5,4) = 4\n          For house2: min(5,6)=5\n\n          Profit = 16+25=41.\n\n          Check restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(4,5)=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,1] -> 4<=4 -> ok.\n            Restriction3: [2,2] -> 5<=6 -> ok.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But now, consider a scenario where the same house is constrained by two restrictions, one with a very low x_i and one with a high one. The minimum is the low one.\n\n   However, what if the restrictions are given in a way that the minimum x_i is not the limiting factor for the entire segment? \n\n        Example: \n          n=3, h=10, m=3\n          Restriction1: [1,3] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [1,1] x2=3\n          Restriction3: [3,3] x3=4\n\n          Then for house1: min(5,3)=3\n          house2: min(5, ...) -> only restriction1? so 5\n          house3: min(5,4)=4\n\n          Profit = 9+25+16=50.\n\n          Check restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,3] -> max(3,5,4)=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,1] -> 3<=3 -> ok.\n            Restriction3: [3,3] -> 4<=4 -> ok.\n\n   But wait, is house2 allowed to be 5? \n        In the entire segment [1,3]: the maximum is 5, which is allowed by restriction1.\n        But restriction2 and restriction3 don't cover house2, so house2 is only constrained by restriction1 (which allows up to 5). So yes.\n\n   However, note that the entire segment [1,3] must be <=5. We set house1 to 3, house2 to 5, house3 to 4 -> the maximum is 5, which is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the restrictions are overlapping arbitrarily? \n\n   Let me try:\n\n        n=3, h=10, m=4\n        Restriction1: [1,3] x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] x2=4\n        Restriction3: [2,3] x3=6\n        Restriction4: [1,3] x4=3\n\n        Then for house1: min(5,4,3)=3\n        house2: min(5,4,6,3)=3\n        house3: min(5,6,3)=3\n\n        Profit=9+9+9=27.\n\n        Check restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,3] -> max(3,3,3)=3<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,2] -> max(3,3)=3<=4 -> ok.\n            Restriction3: [2,3] -> max(3,3)=3<=6 -> ok.\n            Restriction4: [1,3] -> max(3,3,3)=3<=3 -> ok.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the restrictions are contradictory? \n\n        Example: \n          n=2, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [1,2] x2=3\n\n        Then we set both houses to 3. This satisfies both.\n\n        But what if we have two restrictions that say:\n\n          Restriction1: [1,2] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [1,2] x2=6   -> then we set both to 5 (min(5,6)=5). \n\n        This is also correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        # Initialize M with h for each house\n        M = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            # Update the segment [l-1:r] (0-indexed) to the minimum of current M and x\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < M[j]:\n                    M[j] = x\n\n        # Now, compute the profit\n        profit = 0\n        for height in M:\n            profit += height * height\n\n        print(profit)\n\n   However, wait: what if the same restriction is repeated? We are updating with the minimum x. It doesn't matter if we update with a larger x first and then a smaller one.\n\n   But note: the problem says the restrictions are given and we must satisfy all. The above update is: for each restriction, update the houses in the segment to be at most x. We are doing the min, so if we have two restrictions on the same house with x1 and x2 (x1 < x2), then the house will be set to x1. And if we process x2 first, then the house becomes x2, then we process x1 and it becomes x1. So order does not matter.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two restrictions that are not overlapping? \n\n        Example: \n          n=3, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,1] x1=5\n          Restriction2: [2,2] x2=3\n\n        Then house0: min(10,5)=5\n        house1: min(10,3)=3\n        house2: 10 (no restriction)\n\n        Profit = 25+9+100=134.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if a restriction is repeated? \n\n        Example: two identical restrictions, then we update twice. But the min operation with the same value is idempotent.\n\n   Therefore, the code should work.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says that the restrictions are given, and we must satisfy all. Our method sets the height to the minimum x_i from the restrictions covering the house, and then we use that as the height. \n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that we use the minimal height that satisfies the constraints. It requires that the constraints are satisfied. The minimal height that satisfies the constraints is the minimum x_i from the covering restrictions (and h). But we are free to set the house to any value from 0 to min(h, min_covering_x). \n\n   And we want to maximize the profit. The profit function is a^2, which is increasing and convex. Therefore, the best we can do for a house is to set it to the maximum allowed, i.e., min(h, min_covering_x). \n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if a house is covered by two restrictions, one with x1 and one with x2, and we set it to min(x1,x2). Then the constraints are satisfied (because the house is <= x1 and <= x2). And we cannot set it higher because then one of the restrictions would be violated.\n\n   So the answer is the sum of squares of these minimal allowed values.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example1: ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'] -> output 14.\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        M = [3,3,3]\n        Process restriction1: [1,1,1] -> update index0: min(3,1)=1 -> M[0]=1\n        Process restriction2: [2,2,3] -> update index1: min(3,3)=3 -> M[1]=3\n        Process restriction3: [3,3,2] -> update index2: min(3,2)=2 -> M[2]=2\n        Profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   Example2: ['4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'] -> output 262.\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        M = [10,10,10,10]\n        Process restriction1: [2,3,8] -> update indices1 and 2: min(10,8)=8 -> M[1]=8, M[2]=8\n        Process restriction2: [3,4,7] -> update indices2 and 3: \n            M[2]=min(8,7)=7; M[3]=min(10,7)=7\n        Then M = [10,8,7,7]\n        Profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then we set each house to h, and the profit is n * (h**2).\n\n   Example: n=1, h=5, m=0 -> output 25.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if a restriction has x=0? Then we set the house to 0. \n\n   Example: n=1, h=5, m=1, [1,1,0] -> output 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code as described.\n\n   But note: the problem says the restrictions are given and we must satisfy all. Our method satisfies all.\n\n   However, wait: what if the restrictions are given in a way that the minimum x_i is negative? The problem states 0<=x_i<=h, so no.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: We are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the example input format: the first line contains n, h, m, then m lines.\n\n   We assume that the input is as described.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but in the real problem, we read from stdin.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", we assume standard input.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example1 input string: '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'\n\n   Example2 input string: '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'\n\n   We read the first line, split and convert to integers.\n\n   Then for the next m lines, we do the same.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        M = [h] * n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            # Adjust l, r: the spots are 1-indexed, so we convert to 0-indexed for the list M.\n            start = l-1\n            end = r   # because in Python, range(start, end) goes from start to end-1. But we want to include r-1 (0-indexed) which is the last index of the segment [l, r]. \n            # Actually, the segment [l, r] in 1-indexed corresponds to indices [l-1, r-1] in 0-indexed.\n            for j in range(start, r):   # because r is the 1-indexed end, so we go from start to r-1 (inclusive). But note: the range in the for loop is from start to r (exclusive) so we need to go to r (the 1-indexed) minus one? \n\n            Correction: we want to update from index (l-1) to index (r-1). So:\n\n            for j in range(l-1, r):   # This will go from l-1 to r-1, because the stop index is exclusive.\n\n            But wait: the original code above did:\n\n                for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n            But note: the input r is inclusive. We want to update from l-1 to r-1 (both inclusive). \n\n            Example: l=1, r=3 -> we want to update indices 0,1,2. \n            range(0,3) gives [0,1,2] -> correct.\n\n            So the code is:\n\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n            However, wait: the example input says \"1 1 1\": \n                l=1, r=1 -> then j from 0 to 1 (exclusive) -> j=0. Correct.\n\n            But wait: the example input says \"2 2 3\": \n                l=2, r=2 -> j from 1 to 2 (exclusive) -> j=1. Correct.\n\n            So we are good.\n\n   However, wait: the example input: \"3 3 2\" (third restriction) -> l=3, r=3 -> j from 2 to 3 (exclusive) -> j=2. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x_val < M[j]:\n                    M[j] = x_val\n\n        Then compute the profit.\n\n   But wait: what if the same house is updated multiple times? The inner loop runs for every restriction. Since we are updating M[j] to the minimum x_val, and we process all restrictions, the final M[j] is the minimum of h and the minimum x_val from the restrictions that cover j.\n\n   However, we initialized M[j] to h. Then we update with each restriction. Since the restrictions are processed one by one, and we are updating to the minimum, we are effectively getting the minimum x_val from all restrictions.\n\n   But note: the condition in the if-statement: if x_val < M[j] then update. Initially, M[j] is h, and x_val is <= h, so we update if x_val < h. Then, if we get a smaller x_val later, we update again.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we can optimize by not having the if-statement and simply do:\n\n        M[j] = min(M[j], x_val)\n\n   But the if-statement avoids unnecessary assignment. Since n, m <=50, and the inner loop runs at most 50*50=2500 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   We can also do:\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x_val = int(data[2])\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                M[j] = min(M[j], x_val)\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   But note: if we do min(M[j], x_val) and M[j] is already less than x_val, then we don't change it. The if-statement is equivalent.\n\n   Since performance is not an issue (n, m <=50, and the worst-case total operations is 50*50=2500), we can use either.\n\n   I'll use the min function for clarity.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        M = [h] * n\n        for i in range(m):\n            l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                M[j] = min(M[j], x_val)\n\n        total = 0\n        for height in M:\n            total += height * height\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the input example has two examples, but the problem reads until",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all restrictions that apply to its spot, and the maximum height for any house is capped by the given value \\( h \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights, which encourages setting each house's height as high as possible without violating any restrictions.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive (smallest) value among all restrictions that include that house. This is because any house must comply with the strictest restriction covering it to ensure all constraints are met.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an array `M` where each element is set to the global maximum height \\( h \\).\n   - For each restriction, update the corresponding segment in `M` to the minimum value between the current value and the restriction's height limit. This ensures that each house's height is the smallest maximum allowed by any restriction covering it.\n   - After processing all restrictions, compute the profit by summing the squares of the values in `M`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\( m \\) restrictions and updates up to \\( n \\) elements per restriction. With \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) both up to 50, the total operations are \\( O(m \\times n) \\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    M = [h] * n\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < M[j]:\n                M[j] = x_val\n                \n    total = 0\n    for height in M:\n        total += height * height\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are \\( n \\) (number of spots), \\( h \\) (maximum height), and \\( m \\) (number of restrictions).\n2. **Initialization**: An array `M` is initialized with each element set to \\( h \\), representing the default maximum height for each spot without any restrictions.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the relevant segment in `M` to the minimum value between the current value and the restriction's height limit. This ensures that each house's height is the smallest maximum allowed by any covering restriction.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the values in `M`, which now contain the optimal heights for each house that maximize profit while complying with all restrictions.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging the fact that each house's height is constrained by the most restrictive applicable restriction, allowing us to determine the optimal height directly without complex computations or dynamic programming.",
