The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and note that all previous tasks must be completed.\n\n The key observation:\n Since the ringroad is circular, moving from a house x to house y can be done in two ways? Actually, because it's clockwise only, we have to move in the clockwise direction.\n\n But note: the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house x, the next house is (x % n) + 1? Actually, the houses are numbered 1 to n, and after n comes 1.\n\n However, note that we start at 1. Then we can move to 2, then 3, ... until n, then 1 again.\n\n The problem: we have to do the tasks in the given order. Let the current position be `cur`. For the next task at `a`, we need to move from `cur` to `a` along the ringroad (clockwise). \n\n The distance from `cur` to `a` in a clockwise ringroad of n houses can be calculated as:\n   If a >= cur: then the distance is (a - cur)\n   If a < cur: then the distance is (n - cur + a)   [because we go from cur to n, then wrap to 1 and then to a]\n\n But wait, since the ringroad is circular and we are only allowed to move clockwise, we can also consider:\n\n   distance = (a - cur) % n   -> but this modulus might not work for negative, so let's define:\n\n Actually, we can compute the distance as:\n   d = (a - cur) % n\n   But if (a - cur) is negative, then the modulus will give a positive number that is less than n. However, note that if a < cur, then (a-cur) is negative, and (a-cur) % n gives (a - cur + n) which is the same as our second case.\n\n However, note: we want the direct clockwise distance. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   If we are at cur and want to go to a, the clockwise distance is:\n        d = (a - cur) % n\n        But wait, if a == cur, then d=0. However, if a < cur, then (a-cur) is negative, and (a-cur) % n = n + (a-cur) because modulus with positive n.\n\n Example: n=4, cur=3, a=2 -> (2-3) = -1, (-1)%4 = 3 (which is correct: 3->4->1->2, so 3 steps). But note that 3 steps is the same as (4-3+2)=3.\n\n However, wait: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives output 6.\n\n Let me break down the example:\n\n   Start at 1.\n   First task at 3: \n        From 1 to 3: \n            Option 1: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n            Using formula: (3-1) % 4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> 2 steps.\n\n   Then from 3 to 2:\n        Formula: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 steps (since 3->4->1->2)\n\n   Then from 2 to 3:\n        (3-2)%4 = 1 step.\n\n   Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n But wait, the example says the sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps. However, note that the movement from 3 to 2 is 3 steps: 3->4 (step1), 4->1 (step2), 1->2 (step3). Then from 2->3 is one step (step4) and that adds up to 6.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to break down the steps per move, but the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks.\n\n But note: we start at house 1, then we do the first task at house 3 (distance 2), then second task at house 2 (distance 3), then third task at house 3 (distance 1). Total 6.\n\n However, there is an alternative: sometimes we might break the journey by going around multiple times? But note: the problem states that initially Xenia is at house 1,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in the given order, moving only clockwise. The challenge is to calculate the shortest path between consecutive tasks considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves from her current position to the next task's location along the ringroad. The ringroad is circular with `n` houses, numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order. Moving from house `x` to house `y` can be done either directly if `y >= x` or by going through the end of the ringroad and wrapping around if `y < x`.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each move from the current position `cur` to the next task's position `a`, the distance is calculated as `(a - cur) % n`. If `a` is less than `cur`, this modulus operation effectively computes the distance by wrapping around the ringroad.\n3. **Summing Distances**: The total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, starting from the initial position (house 1). \n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += (a - current)\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by `m` integers representing the tasks' locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` keeps track of the cumulative time taken, starting from 0, and `current` is initialized to 1 (Xenia's starting position).\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task location `a`:\n   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `current`, the distance is simply `a - current`.\n   - If `a` is less than `current`, the distance is `(n - current + a)`, accounting for the circular wrap-around.\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, `current` is updated to `a` for the next iteration.\n5. **Output**: The total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n` and `m`.",
