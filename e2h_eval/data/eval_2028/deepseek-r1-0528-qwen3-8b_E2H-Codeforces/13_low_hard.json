For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes, but we don't know the order. We have to check if they form a major or minor chord.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) for the 12-note chromatic scale.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   # But wait, the problem says the notes are cyclic and we start with C. However, note that in some systems H is B? \n    Actually, the problem states: \"notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n    But wait: the example input includes 'A B H'. Also, the example chord \"C# B F\" is minor.\n\n    Let me map according to the list:\n\n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11\n\n 2. The chord is an unordered set of three notes. We need to check all permutations (orderings) of these three notes.\n\n    Conditions for major: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n        (distance from x to y) = 4 semitones, (distance from y to z) = 3 semitones, and then the distance from x to z must be 7.\n\n    Conditions for minor: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n        (distance from x to y) = 3 semitones, (distance from y to z) = 4 semitones, and then the distance from x to z must be 7.\n\n    Note: The distance is computed as the smallest positive distance along the cycle (which is modulo 12). However, the problem states that the distance from E to C is 8 (if we go from E to F, F to F#, G, G# to A, A to A#, B, C: that's 8 steps). But note: the problem also says the distance from the lowest to the highest is taken by going upward. However, when the notes wrap around, we consider the cyclic nature.\n\n    But wait, the example: \"E to C\": \n        In our mapping: E=4, C=0. If we go from E to C, we can go up: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->A#->B->C -> that's 8 semitones. But if we go downward? The problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we must consider the direction of increasing tone? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n    So the distance from E to C would be considered by taking the path that goes upward from E until we reach C? But that would require wrapping? Actually, the problem states the notes are cyclic and the distance is measured from the lowest to the uppest. However, note that E and C: if we have E (4) and C (0), then the direct upward path from E to C is 8 semitones (because 0 - 4 mod 12 is negative, so we add 12: (0 + 12) - 4 = 8). Alternatively, we can compute the distance from E to C as (0 - 4) % 12, but that gives negative. So we take the minimal positive distance in the circle.\n\n    However, the problem does not say that the distance is the minimal one. It says: \"The distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\".\n\n    So the distance is directional: from lower to higher. But note: the chord definition requires ordering the notes. The ordering must be such that we are moving from lower to higher. But wait, the example \"C# B F\": they reordered to \"B C# F\". Then the distances are from B to C#: 1 step (which is 1 semitone, but wait 1 semitone is 0.5 tone, but the problem counts semitones as the unit? Actually",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number from 0 to 11 based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc., up to H=11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the difference between their mapped values. If the direct difference is negative, we adjust it by adding 12 to account for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Checking Chord Types**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor chord. A major chord requires distances of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, we determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange (neither).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_str = input().split()\n    mapping = {'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6, 'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11}\n    \n    nums = []\n    for note in notes_str:\n        parts = note.split()\n        total = 0\n        for part in parts:\n            if part == 'is':\n                continue\n            if part in mapping:\n                total += mapping[part]\n        nums.append(total)\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d_ab = (b - a) % 12\n        d_bc = (c - b) % 12\n        d_ac = (c - a) % 12\n        \n        if d_ab == 4 and d_bc == 3 and d_ac == 7:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        d_ab_alt = (a - b) % 12\n        d_bc_alt = (b - c) % 12\n        d_ac_alt = (a - c) % 12\n        \n        if d_ab_alt == 3 and d_bc_alt == 4 and d_ac_alt == 7:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as a single line of three space-separated notes. Each note may consist of multiple parts (e.g., \"C#\", \"B\", \"F\").\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note part is mapped to its corresponding numerical value using a predefined dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three mapped values are generated to explore every possible ordering of the notes.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. The distance is computed modulo 12 to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Chord Classification**: The solution checks if any permutation meets the distance criteria for a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord. If both are found, the chord is classified as \"strange\" (though the problem guarantees this won't happen). Otherwise, it prints \"major\" or \"minor\" based on the findings.",
