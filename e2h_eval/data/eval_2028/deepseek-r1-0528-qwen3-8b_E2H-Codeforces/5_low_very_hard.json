Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters). We have to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot) such that the colors are compatible.\n\n Compatibility rules:\n   - Two specific colors: must be the same.\n   - Indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color.\n\n However, note that we cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can break down the problem into two parts:\n    a. Pairs that do not involve question marks (specific boots).\n    b. Pairs that involve at least one question mark.\n\n But note: an indefinite color '?' can match any color, so we have to consider that a '?' might be used to match either a specific color or another '?'.\n\n However, the problem is asking for maximum number of pairs and then to output the pairs.\n\n Important: We cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the constraints are up to 150000, we need an efficient solution.\n\n Let's think:\n\n We can consider two types of boots: specific (non '?') and wildcard (which includes both the '?' in left and right).\n\n But note: the matching condition for two boots (left and right) is:\n   - If left[i] is not '?' and right[j] is not '?', then they must be equal.\n   - If left[i] is '?' or right[j] is '?', then they are compatible.\n\n However, we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n How to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n We can try:\n\n Step 1: Count the total number of non '?' boots and how they can be matched.\n\n However, note that sometimes using a '?' to match a non '?' might be necessary because there is no other way to match that non '?'.\n\n But note: we want maximum pairs. The maximum pairs cannot exceed n (since we have n left and n right).\n\n We can use a greedy matching? But note that the problem also requires to output the pairs.\n\n Alternative idea:\n\n We can split the problem:\n\n   Case 1: Matching without wildcards (only specific boots). Then, we can use a frequency map for the specific boots on left and right.\n\n   However, note: even if we have a '?' we can use it to match any color, so we can postpone the matching of specific boots until we have exhausted the possibility of matching with '?'.\n\n But wait: we want maximum pairs. The maximum pairs is achieved by:\n\n   - First, we can use as many specific boots as possible (without using the '?' as specific) but note: sometimes we can use a specific boot to match a '?'? Actually, the problem says: \n        An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n   So, we can use a specific boot to match a '?' and vice versa.\n\n However, the catch is: we are allowed to use a '?' as a wildcard for any color, but we cannot break the rule that two specific colors must be the same.\n\n So, we can form a pair between two boots if:\n\n   Option A: Both are specific and equal.\n   Option B: At least one is '?'.\n\n But note: we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n We are allowed to assign each boot at most once.\n\n We can think of this as a bipartite graph matching where the left side is the left boots and the right side is the right boots.\n\n Each edge exists if the two boots are compatible.\n\n Then, we want the maximum matching.\n\n However, n can be up to 150000, so we cannot use general bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft–Karp) which are O(n^2) or worse.\n\n But note: the graph is defined by a very regular pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute two arrays: \n        left_colors = list of l_i (each element is either a letter or '?')\n        right_colors = list of r_i\n\n   Step 2: We can count the frequency of each letter in the left and right for non '?' characters.\n\n   Step 3: We can also note that the '?' can match anything.\n\n   Let's define:\n\n        Let L_non = [i for i, c in enumerate(l) if c != '?']   -> indices and color for non '?' left boots.\n        Let R_non = [i for i, c in enumerate(r) if c != '?']   -> indices and color for non '?' right boots.\n\n   Now, for the non '?' boots, we can form pairs only if the colors match. However, we can also use the '?' boots to match the remaining non '?' boots if needed.\n\n   But note: the maximum pairs is the minimum of (number of left boots, number of right boots) but constrained by the matching conditions.\n\n   However, the problem is asking for maximum pairs.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Step ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be identical, while an indefinite color ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching two sets of boots (left and right) based on their colors. The key observation is that '?' can act as a wildcard, matching any color. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs while ensuring no boot is used more than once.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main steps:\n   - **Matching Non-Wildcard Boots**: First, match all non-'?' boots that have the same color. This ensures we use up all possible specific matches before utilizing wildcards.\n   - **Handling Remaining Boots**: For the remaining boots (those not matched yet, which include wildcards and unmatched specific boots), we can pair them arbitrarily since wildcards can match any color.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Counting**: For non-'?' boots, count the frequency of each color in both left and right boots. This helps in matching boots with the same color.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: After matching all possible non-'?' boots, the remaining boots (both '?' and unmatched specific boots) can be paired together in any order since '?' can match any color.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently processes the input by first counting frequencies (O(n)) and then matching pairs (O(n)), resulting in an overall linear time complexity O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 150000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_non = []\n    right_non = []\n    left_wild = []\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] != '?':\n            left_non.append((l_str[i], i))\n        else:\n            left_wild.append(i)\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if r_str[i] != '?':\n            right_non.append((r_str[i], i))\n        else:\n            right_wild.append(i)\n            \n    freq_left = defaultdict(int)\n    freq_right = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for char, idx in left_non:\n        freq_left[char] += 1\n        \n    for char, idx in right_non:\n        freq_right[char] += 1\n        \n    total_pairs = 0\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    result_pairs = []\n    \n    for char in freq_left:\n        if char in freq_right:\n            count_min = min(freq_left[char], freq_right[char])\n            total_pairs += count_min\n            for _ in range(count_min):\n                found_left = None\n                found_right = None\n                for lc in left_non:\n                    if not used_left[lc[1]] and lc[0] == char:\n                        found_left = lc[1]\n                        break\n                for rc in right_non:\n                    if not used_right[rc[1]] and rc[0] == char:\n                        found_right = rc[1]\n                        break\n                if found_left is not None and found_right is not None:\n                    used_left[found_left] = True\n                    used_right[found_right] = True\n                    result_pairs.append((found_left + 1, found_right + 1))\n                    \n    remaining_left = [i+1 for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n    remaining_right = [i+1 for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n    \n    total_remaining = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n    total_pairs += total_remaining\n    \n    for i in range(total_remaining):\n        left_idx = remaining_left[i]\n        right_idx = remaining_right[i]\n        result_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    print(total_pairs)\n    for a, b in result_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots `n`, followed by two strings representing the left and right boots' colors.\n2. **Separating Boots**: The code separates the boots into those with specific colors and those with wildcards ('?').\n3. **Frequency Counting**: It counts the occurrences of each specific color in both left and right boots.\n4. **Matching Specific Boots**: The code matches boots with the same specific color, ensuring no boot is used more than once.\n5. **Handling Wildcards**: The remaining boots (whether they are wildcards or unmatched specific boots) are paired together since wildcards can match any color.\n6. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging frequency counting and greedy matching, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
