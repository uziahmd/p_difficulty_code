The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that we process the tasks in order.\n\n The challenge: Since the ring is circular, moving from house x to house y can be done by going clockwise or counter-clockwise?\n But note: the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So we can only move clockwise.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is one-way clockwise.\n\n Therefore, the movement is only clockwise. This means that from house i, the next house is i+1 (with wrap-around: after n comes 1).\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives output 6.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n   n=4, m=3, tasks = [3, 2, 3]\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1.\n   Then go to 3: \n        From 1 -> 2 -> 3: that's 2 steps (but note: from 1 to 3: clockwise: 1->2->3, so 2 moves).\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        But wait, we can't go counter-clockwise because the road is one-way. However, note that the ring is circular and we can only go forward (clockwise). \n        So from 3, we go 3->4->1->2: that's 3 moves.\n\n   Alternatively, is there a better way? Actually, note the condition: we must complete the tasks in order. So we must do:\n\n        Start at 1, then go to 3 (task1) -> then from 3 to 2 (task2) -> then from 2 to 3 (task3)\n\n   But wait, how do we get from 3 to 2? Since it's clockwise, we have to go: 3->4->1->2 (which is 3 steps). \n\n   Then the total steps would be: \n        1->3: 2 steps (from 1 to 3: 2 moves)\n        3->2: 3 steps (as above)\n        2->3: 1 step\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   Another example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        n=4, m=3, tasks = [2, 3, 3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Then to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n        Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n        Then from 3 to 3: 0 steps.\n\n        Total: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\" and the tasks are given in order.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n   Therefore, the approach:\n\n   We start at house 1. Then we have a sequence of tasks. Since we can only move clockwise, we can compute the distance from the current house to the next task's house by:\n\n        distance = (a_i - current) % n   ??? \n\n   But note: we cannot use modulo because the movement is strictly clockwise and the houses are numbered 1..n. Also, if we are at current and want to go to a_i, we can consider:\n\n        If a_i >= current, then the clockwise distance is (a_i - current)\n        If a_i < current, then the clockwise distance is (n - current + a_i)\n\n   However, note: we start at 1, then we might have multiple tasks. But after completing a task, our current position becomes the task's house.\n\n   We can simulate:\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for each task in the list:\n            if task >= current:\n                steps = task - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + task\n\n            total_time += steps\n            current = task\n\n   Let's test with the first example: [3,2,3] and n=4.\n\n        Start: current=1, task=3 -> 3>=1 -> steps=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n        Then task=2: 2<3 -> steps=4-3+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n        Then task=3: 3>2 -> steps=3-2=1, total_time=6, current=3.\n\n        This gives 6, which is correct.\n\n   Now second example: [2,3,3] and n=4.\n\n        Start: current=1, task=2 -> 2>=1 -> steps=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n        Then task=3: 3>=2 -> steps=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n        Then task=3: steps=0, total_time=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note the constraints: n and m up to 10^5. This simulation is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning that the order is fixed. Our simulation does exactly that.\n\n   However, let me check with an example that requires more than one full circle? \n\n   Example: n=4, tasks = [4, 1, 2]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Task1: 4 -> from 1 to 4: 4-1=3 (if 4>=1 -> yes) -> steps=3, current=4, total_time=3.\n        Task2: 1 -> from 4 to 1: since 1<4 -> steps=4-4+1=1, total_time=4, current=1.\n        Task3: 2 -> from 1 to 2: 2-1=1, total_time=5.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n          1->2->3->4 (3 steps) then 4->1 (1 step) then 1->2 (1 step). Total 5.\n\n        But is there a possibility that we can avoid going all the way around? \n\n        In this case, the problem says we must complete tasks in order. So we must be at 4 first, then at 1, then at 2.\n\n        The movement is forced to be clockwise.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        Read n, m.\n        Read the list of m integers.\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            task = arr[i]\n            if task >= current:\n                steps = task - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + task\n\n            total_time += steps\n            current = task\n\n        Print total_time\n\n   However, note: the example input format might be provided as a string, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as two examples. We are supposed to read from stdin.\n\n   Example input format:\n\n        First line: \"4 3\"\n        Second line: \"3 2 3\"\n\n   We can read:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n        Then n = int(data[0]), m = int(data[1])\n        Then the next m integers: starting from index 2, take m numbers.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the second line contains m integers.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the same house appears consecutively? Then steps=0, which is correct.\n\n   Example: [1,1,1] for n=4: \n        Start at 1.\n        task1: 1>=1 -> steps=0, current=1, total_time=0.\n        task2: 1>=1 -> steps=0, total_time=0.\n        task3: 0.\n\n   So total_time=0.\n\n   This makes sense.\n\n   Let's test with a bigger circle: n=5, tasks=[5,1,2]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        task5: 5>=1 -> steps=4, current=5, total_time=4.\n        task1: 1<5 -> steps=5-5+1=1, total_time=5, current=1.\n        task2: 2>=1 -> steps=1, total_time=6.\n\n        Alternatively: \n            1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps) then 5->1 (1 step) then 1->2 (1 step): total 6.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for task in arr:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += task - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + task\n            current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   But wait: what if the task is 0? The problem says ai between 1 and n, so no zeros.\n\n   However, note: the problem states \"1 ≤ ai ≤ n\", so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the example input was provided as two separate examples. Our program reads two lines.\n\n   However, the problem says: \n        The first line contains two integers n and m.\n        The second line contains m integers.\n\n   So the above code should work.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as two strings: \n        ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n   But in standard input, we will get:\n\n        For the first example: \n            Input: \n                4 3\n                3 2 3\n\n        We read the first line and split to get [4,3] and then the second line and split to get [3,2,3].\n\n   However, the problem says: \"do not use %lld specifier\" but that is for C++. In Python, we use int() and list(map(int, ...)).\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example1: n=4, m=3, arr=[3,2,3] -> output 6.\n        Example2: n=4, m=3, arr=[2,3,3] -> output 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: what if the tasks are not decreasing? For example, if we have a task that is very large and then a task that is small, we do the entire circle.\n\n   Example: n=10, tasks=[10, 1] \n        Start at 1.\n        task10: 10>=1 -> steps=9, current=10, total_time=9.\n        task1: 1<10 -> steps=10-10+1=1, total_time=10.\n\n        Alternatively: \n            From 1 to 10: 1->2->3->...->10: 9 steps.\n            Then from 10 to 1: 10->1: 1 step (because clockwise: 10->1 is one step? Actually, in a ring of 10, the clockwise movement from 10 goes to 1. So yes, one step.\n\n        So 9+1=10.\n\n   But wait, let me clarify: the ringroad has houses 1 to n, and after n comes 1. So from 10 to 1 is indeed one step.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\". So from 10 to 1 is adjacent in the ring? \n\n        Houses: 1,2,...,10, and then 1 is next to 10? Yes, because it's a ring.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example in the problem statement: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n   But wait, the example input in the problem statement is given as two separate examples. Our program must handle one test case per run.\n\n   Since the problem doesn't specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for task in arr:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += task - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + task\n            current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   However, wait: what if the task list is empty? m=0, then we don't enter the loop, and we print 0. That is correct because no tasks to do.\n\n   Let's test with m=0.\n\n   But the constraint: m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n   But the problem says m>=1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, and we are doing a simple for-loop and arithmetic operations. This is O(m) and efficient.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait: there is a possibility of integer overflow? The problem says to use 64-bit integers, but in Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\n   However, note that the total_time might be very large (up to 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is within the range of Python integers and even fits in 32-bit signed integers? Actually, 10^10 is 10 billion, which is about 10^10, which is 10^10/ (10^9) = 10 GB in worst-case scenario for storing an integer? No, integers in Python are stored efficiently, but the value is 10^10, which is 10 billion, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: worst-case scenario for the total_time: \n        Each task might require up to n-1 steps, and we have m tasks, so maximum total_time is m*(n-1) which is 10^10 (since n<=10^5, m<=10^5, so max 10^10). This is acceptable in Python.\n\n   However, in C++ we would use long long (which is 64-bit) but in Python we don't need to worry.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for task in arr:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += task - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + task\n            current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let me run the examples again to be sure.\n\n   Example 1: [3,2,3] for n=4 -> 6\n   Example 2: [2,3,3] for n=4 -> 2\n\n   Example 3: [10,1] for n=10 -> 9+1 = 10.\n\n   Example 4: [1,2,3,4] for n=4 -> \n        Start at 1.\n        1: 0 steps, current=1.\n        2: 1 step, current=2, total=1.\n        3: 1 step, current=3, total=2.\n        4: 1 step, current=4, total=3.\n\n        But wait, from 1 to 2: 1 step, 2 to 3: 1 step, 3 to 4: 1 step. So total 3 steps.\n\n        Alternatively: 1->2->3->4: 3 steps.\n\n        However, the code for [1,2,3,4] with n=4:\n\n            task1: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n            task2: 2>=1 -> 1, total=1, current=2.\n            task3: 3>=2 -> 1, total=2, current=3.\n            task4: 4>=3 -> 1, total=3.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Example 5: [4,3,2,1] for n=4:\n        Start at 1.\n        task4: 4>=1 -> 3, current=4, total=3.\n        task3: 3<4 -> 4-4+3 = 3, total=6, current=3.\n        task2: 2<3 -> 4-3+2=3, total=9, current=2.\n        task1: 1<2 -> 4-2+1=3, total=12.\n\n        Alternatively: \n            1->2->3->4: 3 steps (to do task4)\n            Then from 4 to 3: 4->1->2->3: 3 steps (so far 6)\n            Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2: 3 steps (9)\n            Then from 2 to 1: 2->3->4->1: 3 steps (12)\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. Our calculation for the else branch is: n - current + task.\n\n        Why is that? Because when task < current, we have to go from current to the end (n) and then from 1 to task. The number of steps is (n - current) to go from current to n, and then (task) from 1 to task (but note: from n to 1 is 1 step, then 1 to task is task-1? Wait, no: actually, the entire path is:\n\n        current -> current+1 -> ... -> n -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> task.\n\n        The number of steps from current to n: (n - current)\n        Then from n to 1: 1 step (so total n - current + 1) but wait, then from 1 to task: (task - 1) steps? \n\n        Actually, the entire path is:\n\n            current, current+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., task.\n\n        Number of steps: (n - current) + (task)   [because from 1 to task is task-1+1? Actually, from 1 to task: we pass through task-1 houses? No, the movement from 1 to task: if we count edges, then from 1 to 2 is 1, from 1 to task is (task-1) edges? But wait, we did:\n\n            In the else branch: we said steps = n - current + task.\n\n        Let me check with the example: n=4, current=3, task=2.\n\n            n - current + task = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3.\n\n        How many steps from 3 to 2 in a ring of 4? \n            3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (2nd step), 1->2 (3rd step). So 3 steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the direct clockwise distance from current to task when task < current is:\n\n            (n - current) + task   [because we go from current to the end (n) and then from the beginning (1) to task]\n\n        But note: the entire circle has n houses. The clockwise distance from current to task (when task < current) is: \n            (n - current + task) \n\n        This formula is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road in a clockwise direction. The ring road consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n`, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. Moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves only clockwise on the ring road. The key observation is that the distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions. If the target house is ahead of the current house in the clockwise direction, the distance is simply the difference between the two. However, if the target house is behind (i.e., its number is smaller than the current house), the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from the start (house 1) to the target house.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating through each task in sequence. For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house using the formula:\n   - If the task house is greater than or equal to the current house: `distance = task - current`\n   - Otherwise: `distance = n - current + task`\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for task in arr:\n        if task >= current:\n            steps = task - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + task\n        total_time += steps\n        current = task\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The subsequent values are the tasks themselves.\n2. **Initialization**: `current` is initialized to 1 (starting house), and `total_time` is initialized to 0 (accumulated time).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task, the algorithm checks if the task's house is ahead of or behind the current house. The steps required to reach the task's house are calculated accordingly and added to `total_time`. The `current` house is updated to the task's house after processing.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time taken is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and straightforward arithmetic to determine movement distances.",
