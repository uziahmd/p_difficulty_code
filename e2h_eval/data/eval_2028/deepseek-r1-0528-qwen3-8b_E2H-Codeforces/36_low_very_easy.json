The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000) and we have n+2 towns: 0, 1, ..., n+1.\n We build a tower in each town i (from 1 to n) with probability 1/2, independently.\n\n Conditions for the signal powers:\n   - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n   - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one tower.\n\n Observation:\n\n Let's denote by S the set of built towers (each subset of {1,2,...,n} is equally likely).\n\n We need to assign a positive integer signal power p_i for each built tower at town i.\n\n The condition for a built tower at town i with power p_i is that it covers all towns j such that |j-i| < p_i.\n\n But note: the problem requires that:\n   - Town 0: must not be covered by any tower. This means that if a tower is built at town 1, then its power must be set so that it doesn't reach town 0. Similarly, if a tower is built at town i, then the condition for covering town 0 is that |0 - i| >= p_i. Since p_i>=1, we require that i >= p_i. For example, if a tower is built at town 1, then p_1 must be 1 (because if p_1>=2 then |0-1|=1 < p_1 would cover town0). Similarly, for a tower at town i, the power must be at most i (so that it doesn't reach town0). However, note that the condition for covering town0 is only that the tower at i does not cover 0: |0-i| = i, so we require i >= p_i.\n\n Similarly, for town n+1: the condition is that no tower must cover it. So for a tower at town i, we require that |n+1 - i| >= p_i. Since |n+1-i| = n+1-i, we require p_i <= n+1-i.\n\n Additionally, each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower. Note that a town j can be covered by a tower at i if |i - j| < p_i. Also, note that if j is built (i.e., there is a tower at j) then we can set the power so that the tower at j covers itself? Actually, the problem says \"exactly one\", so we must ensure that each j is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n How can we think?\n\n Another important observation: the problem is symmetric. We can also consider that the entire set of built towers must form a structure that allows partitioning the towns 1 to n into intervals (each covered by one tower) without covering 0 and n+1.\n\n However, note that the example: n=5, built towers at 2,4,5. Then:\n   Tower at 2: set to 2 -> covers [0,3] but wait: the definition is |c-2| < 2, so c in (0,4) -> so towns 1,2,3 are covered (note: town0 is at 0, so |0-2|=2 is not <2 -> safe; town4: |4-2|=2 is not <2 -> not covered by tower2). Then tower4: set to 1 -> covers (3,5) -> so town4 is covered (since |4-4|=0<1) and town5 is not covered because |5-4|=1 is not <1. Similarly, tower5: set to 1 -> covers (4,6) -> so town5 is covered (|5-5|=0<1) and town6 (which is n+1=6) is not covered because |6-5|=1 not <1.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n   Towns 1,2,3 get the signal from the tower in town2, town4 gets from town4, and town5 from town5.\n\n So the conditions for the coverage of a town j are:\n\n   - j must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n   - The tower that covers j must have a power p_i such that |i - j| < p_i.\n\n   - Additionally, the same tower must not cover any other town outside the required segment? Actually, the condition is that the entire segment of coverage might overlap, but the requirement is that each j is covered by exactly one.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire set of built towers is used. We can set the powers arbitrarily (from 1 to n). But note: we cannot use a tower that is built to cover beyond what is needed because of the constraints on covering 0 and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, we can assign signal powers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is recognizing that the problem reduces to counting the number of valid subsets of towns where the towers can be placed such that the conditions are met. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid configurations modulo 998244353.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Towns Coverage**: A tower at position `i` with power `p` covers towns from `i - p + 1` to `i + p - 1`. To ensure towns 0 and n+1 are not covered, the power of a tower at `i` must satisfy `p ≤ i` (to avoid covering town 0) and `p ≤ n + 1 - i` (to avoid covering town n+1).\n   - **Unique Coverage**: Each town `j` (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower. This implies that the coverage segments of the towers must not overlap except at their endpoints, and each segment must cover exactly one town.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - **State Definition**: Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to configure the first `i` towns (from 1 to i) such that all conditions are satisfied up to town `i`.\n   - **Transition**: For each town `i`, if a tower is built, it can cover either just itself or a range from `i - k + 1` to `i + k - 1` for some `k`. The transition involves checking the validity of these ranges without overlapping with previous configurations.\n\n3. **Modulo Handling**:\n   - Since the result can be large, all operations are performed modulo 998244353. The answer is derived by computing the ratio of valid configurations to total configurations (which is `2^n`), using modular arithmetic to handle division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n        \n    inv2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_denom = pow(inv2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    ans = numerator * inv_denom % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - For `n = 1`, the answer is trivially 1 because the single town must have a tower with power 1, covering only itself, leaving towns 0 and 2 uncovered.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:\n   - `dp[i]` is initialized to store the number of valid configurations up to town `i`. The base cases `dp[0] = 1` (no towns considered) and `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to configure the first town) are set.\n\n3. **DP Transition**:\n   - For each subsequent town `i`, the number of valid configurations is the sum of configurations where the current town is either included (and covers itself or a range) or excluded. The transition `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD` effectively checks these two scenarios.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - The total number of configurations is `2^n`, computed as `inv2n`. The modular inverse of `inv2n` is used to compute the probability as `numerator * inv_denom % MOD`, where `numerator` is `dp[n]`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring correctness and optimal performance even for large `n`.",
