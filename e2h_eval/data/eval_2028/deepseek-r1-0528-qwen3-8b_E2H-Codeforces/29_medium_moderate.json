Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with string transformations and then computing the number modulo 10^9+7.\n However, note: the problem is about processing multiple queries that replace each occurrence of a digit d by a string t (which can be empty or contain digits).\n\n Important: The replacements are done in the given order. But note that later queries might affect digits that were inserted by earlier ones.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\", then two queries: first \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n   Then the first query replaces \"222\" to \"000\", then the second query replaces \"0\" to \"7\", so \"000\" becomes \"777\".\n\n However, if we do the replacements naively (by scanning the string and replacing every occurrence of '2' by '0' and then every occurrence of '0' by '7'), we get the correct result.\n\n But note: the problem says the total length of all ti's is up to 10^5, but the initial string s is up to 10^5, and there are up to 10^5 queries.\n\n However, if we try to simulate each query by scanning the entire string for the digit to replace, and then replacing, the cost could be too high because after one replacement the string becomes longer and the next replacement would have to scan an even longer string.\n\n Alternative approach: process the queries in reverse? Or use dynamic programming?\n\n Observation: Each query is independent and the transformation is applied sequentially. We can think of the entire transformation as a function from the original string to the final string.\n\n However, the problem is that a digit in the original string might be replaced by a string that contains digits that are subject to subsequent queries.\n\n We can precompute the effect of all the queries from last to first. But note: the queries are applied in the given order.\n\n Another idea: Since there are only 10 digits (0-9) and the total length of all replacement strings is at most 10^5, we can use dynamic programming for each digit (from '0' to '9') to compute what it becomes at the end.\n\n But wait: the replacements are sequential and may overlap in the sense that a replacement in an earlier query might introduce digits that are replaced by later queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are specified by a digit and a replacement string. The catch: the replacement string might contain any digits, including the same digit that is being replaced (or other digits that will be replaced later).\n\n How to handle:\n\n Idea: Instead of processing the string sequentially (which would be too slow because the string grows), we can precompute for each digit what is its final representation after processing all the queries.\n\n Steps:\n  1. We have 10 digits (0-9). Let f(d) be the final representation of the digit d.\n  2. But note: the queries are applied in order. So, we need to apply the queries from the first to the last.\n\n However, we cannot simply process each query independently because the same digit might appear in multiple queries.\n\n Alternate known technique: This is similar to macro expansion or to applying a series of substitution rules until no more changes? But note: the problem does not require to stop when no change occurs, but to apply the queries in the given order.\n\n But note: the problem says \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\", and then the next query uses the updated string.\n\n However, we can reverse the order of processing the queries? Actually, no, because the first query replaces some digits, and the second query operates on the entire transformed string (which includes the results of the first).\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the replacement is done only on the original digits. It says \"replace all digits di\" in the current string.\n\n So, we must consider that the replacement strings from earlier queries might contain digits that are subject to later queries.\n\n Therefore, we can use a recursive/iterative method for each digit.\n\n However, we have up to 10^5 queries and 10^5 total characters in replacement strings. We cannot simulate the entire string because the string can become very long.\n\n Insight: The problem is asking for the number modulo 1000000007. We don't need the actual string, but the number.\n\n We can use dynamic programming to compute the value contributed by each digit in the final string and the length of the final representation (for shifting).\n\n But note: the operations are sequential and we have to account for the fact that a digit d is replaced by a string t, and then every digit in t is subject to the remaining queries.\n\n We can precompute the transformation for each digit from the last query backwards.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Let's define an array (or dictionary) `trans` for digits 0 to 9, which will store two things for each digit:\n    - The final string that the digit expands to (but we cannot store the entire string because the total length is bounded by 10^5, but we have 10 digits and 10^5 queries, and the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, so we can store the transformation for each digit as a string and update them in reverse order).\n\n However, storing the entire string for each digit might be too heavy because after many queries the string for a digit might become very long.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the transformation for each digit by:\n   - The numeric value it represents (modulo 1000000007)\n   - The length of the string it represents (so we know how to shift the following digits)\n\n But note: the replacements are done in order, and the entire string is built from these expansions.\n\n However, the problem: the expansion of a digit d in the first query is a string, and then that string is subject to the subsequent queries.\n\n We can process the queries from last to first, and for each digit, we keep:\n\n   dp[digit] = (value, length)\n\n where:\n   value: the numeric value of the final string that this digit expands to, modulo 1000000007.\n   length: the total number of digits in the final string.\n\n Then, for a query (d -> t), we want to set the transformation for d to be the concatenation of the transformations of every character in t.\n\n However, we are processing the queries backwards. Initially, after the last query, the transformation for a digit d is just d itself (unless there was a query for d, but we are processing from last to first, so we start from the last query and go backwards).\n\n Steps for reverse processing:\n\n   Let base: for each digit d from '0' to '9', we set:\n        trans[d] = (int(d), 1)\n\n   Then, we process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For a query (d -> t):\n\n        We want to set the transformation for d to be the expansion of t using the current transformations (which include all queries from the last one up to the current one).\n\n        But note: the current transformation for d is being overwritten. However, the current query is for d, so we want to replace d by t, and then t is expanded by the subsequent queries (which we have already processed in reverse order).\n\n        So, we do:\n\n          new_value = 0\n          new_length = 0\n\n          For each char c in t:\n            Let (v, l) = trans[c]   (this is the expansion of c from the subsequent queries)\n            Then, we are going to put this expansion at the end. But note: the expansion for c is a string of l digits, and the value v is the number represented by that string.\n\n            Then, the entire number for t is built as:\n\n                new_value = (new_value * (10 ** l) + v) % MOD\n\n            And new_length += l\n\n        Then set trans[d] = (new_value, new_length)\n\n   However, note: the entire string is built by the concatenation of the expansions of each digit. But we are processing the digits independently.\n\n   Then, after processing all queries, we have for each digit d the tuple (value, length). Then, the initial string s is transformed by replacing each digit d_i by its expansion.\n\n   Then, the entire number is:\n\n        result = 0\n        for each char c in s:\n            (v, l) = trans[c]\n            result = (result * (10 ** l) + v) % MOD\n\n   But wait: is that correct? \n\n        Example: s = \"12\", and suppose we have a query \"1->12\", then the expansion for '1' is the expansion for \"12\", i.e., we break \"12\" into '1' and '2'. But note: we are processing the queries in reverse, and the query \"1->12\" is processed first (in reverse order, meaning we start from the last query and go backwards). Actually, we are processing the queries from last to first.\n\n        However, the example: \n          Input: \"222\", queries: [\"2->0\", \"0->7\"]\n\n        We process queries in reverse order: first the last query \"0->7\", then the first query \"2->0\".\n\n        After processing \"0->7\": \n            For digit '0': \n                t = \"7\"\n                Then, for each char in \"7\": c='7'\n                We haven't processed any query for '7'? Actually, we are processing from last to first, so we start with the base (each digit is itself) and then the last query is \"0->7\". Then we update '0' to be the expansion of \"7\", which is (7,1). Then we process the previous query \"2->0\":\n                For digit '2': t = \"0\"\n                Then, for each char in \"0\": we use trans['0'] which is (7,1)\n                Then, new_value = (0 * (10^1) + 7) = 7, and new_length=1.\n                So now, '2' expands to (7,1)\n\n        Then, the initial string \"222\" becomes three times the expansion of '2', i.e., three times (7,1). Then the number is:\n\n            result = 0\n            for c in \"222\": \n                (7,1) -> \n                result = (0 * 10^1 + 7) = 7\n                then (7 * 10^1 + 7) = 77\n                then (77 * 10^1 + 7) = 777.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   But note: the modulus is 1000000007.\n\n   However, we need to compute 10**l modulo 1000000007? But l can be large (the total length of the expansion of a digit can be very big). But note: the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, and we have 10^5 queries, but the length for a digit might be huge (exponentially growing?) but wait: the total length of all replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the expansion of a digit might be the concatenation of many expansions, so the length might be huge (like 10^5 steps, and each step multiplies the length by the length of the replacement). However, note the constraint: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. But the expansion of a digit might be built from multiple queries, and the length might be the product of the lengths of the replacements? \n\n   Actually, the worst-case growth: if we have a chain of replacements that multiply the length, then the length could be exponential. But note: the problem says the total length of all ti (the replacement strings) is <= 10^5. However, the expansion of a digit might be built from multiple queries, and the length we store for each digit is the total length of the expansion. But the total length of the expansion for a digit might become very large (exceeding 10^5) because of concatenation.\n\n   However, note: the initial total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion of a digit might use digits that have been expanded, and these expansions might be long. But the problem says the total length of the replacement strings (the ti's) is <= 10^5. But the expansion process is defined by the queries, and we are storing the entire expansion for each digit. \n\n   But wait: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the input constraint. However, the expansion of a digit may result in a very long string (if we have many nested replacements). \n\n   However, we are storing the expansion as (value, length). We cannot store the entire string because it might be too long. But we can store the value and the length.\n\n   But the value is modulo 1000000007, and the length is the total number of digits. The length is important for shifting.\n\n   However, the problem: the length might be astronomically large. We cannot store the exact integer for the length if we are going to use it as an exponent for 10. But note: we are only storing the length modulo nothing? Actually, the shifting factor is 10^(length). But the length is the total number of digits, and we are going to use it as an exponent. However, the exponent can be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot compute 10^length mod 1000000007 directly by pow(10, length, 1000000007) because length is too big? Actually, we can use modular exponentiation, but note: the modulus for exponents in modular arithmetic doesn't work the same way as for the base.\n\n   However, we are not raising 10 to the power of length modulo 1000000007. The shifting is: \n\n        result = (result * (10 ** l) + v) % MOD\n\n   But 10**l mod 1000000007 can be computed if we know l, but l might be huge (say, 10^18). But note: we are storing the length for each digit. The length is the total number of digits in the expansion. How big can the length be? \n\n   Example: \n        Query 1: \"1->11\"\n        Query 2: \"1->11\"\n\n        Then the expansion of '1' after two queries: \n            After the last query (query2): \n                t = \"11\", so we break into two '1's. Then we use the transformation from query2 (which we haven't processed yet) but wait: we are processing backwards.\n\n        Let me do the reverse processing for two queries:\n\n            Start from the base: each digit d has (int(d), 1)\n\n            Then process query2 (last query): \"1->11\"\n                For digit '1': \n                    t = \"11\"\n                    Then, for each char in \"11\": \n                        char '1': (v1, l1) = (1,1) from base (since base is before any query, but we are processing backwards: we haven't processed query1, so base is the state after all queries? Actually, we start from the last query and go backwards, so the base is the state after processing all the queries that come after the current one. In our reverse processing, we start from the last query and then move to the first. So initially, the state is the base (each digit is itself). Then we process the last query (query2) and update digit '1'. Then we process query1.\n\n            Processing query2 (last query): \n                trans['1'] becomes the expansion of \"11\": \n                    First char '1': (1,1) -> then value=0*10^1+1 = 1, length=1.\n                    Second char '1': (1,1) -> value=1*10^1+1 = 11, length=2.\n\n            Now, process query1 (first query): \"1->11\"\n                Then update '1' again: \n                    t = \"11\"\n                    Now, use the current state (which has the effect of query2) for '1'\n                    So, for each char in \"11\": \n                        First char '1': (11,2) -> so value=0 * (10^2) + 11 = 11, length=2.\n                        Second char '1': (11,2) -> value=11 * (10^2) + 11 = 1100 + 11 = 1111, length=4.\n\n            Then, the expansion for '1' is (1111,4).\n\n        Now, if we have an initial string \"1\", then the result is 1111.\n\n        But if we have a string \"1\", then the first query replaces '1' with \"11\", then the second query replaces both '1's with \"11\", so we get \"1111\". Correct.\n\n        However, the length for '1' is 4, which is the total number of digits.\n\n        Now, the length can grow exponentially. But note: the constraint is the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is <= 10^5. But the expansion of a single digit might result in a string of length up to ... well, if we have a chain of n queries, and each replacement of a digit d by a string of length L, then the length can be up to L^n in the worst case (if we always replace a digit by a string containing that same digit). However, the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion length is not bounded by 10^5. \n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. However, the expansion of a digit may involve multiple queries and the length can be huge (exponential). We cannot store the exact integer for the length if it is too big (like 10^100000). \n\n        However, we are storing the length as an integer. But the length might be too big to represent as an integer (like having 10^5 digits, then the length is 10^5, which is acceptable, but if we have multiple levels, the length might be 2^(number of queries) * something). \n\n        But note: the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion of a digit is built from the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string. The length is additive in the sense of the lengths of the expansions of each character. \n\n        However, the problem: we are storing the length for each digit, and the length is the total number of digits in the expansion. The length can be very large (like the number of digits in the final string). The issue is: we need to compute 10^(length) mod 1000000007. \n\n        But the modulus operation for exponentiation: we can use pow(base, exponent, modulus) but the exponent (the length) might be too big to represent as an integer. However, we can use Euler's theorem? But note: the modulus is 1000000007, and the base is 10. Euler's theorem requires that base and modulus are coprime. They are, so we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007) for modulus 1000000007? But note: 10 and 1000000007 are coprime? 1000000007 is prime, so yes. Then, we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (because phi(1000000007)=1000000006). \n\n        However, the exponent (the length) is the total number of digits. But wait: the shifting factor is 10^(length) mod 1000000007. We can compute:\n\n            shift = pow(10, length, 1000000007)\n\n        But the length might be too big to represent as an integer? \n\n        Actually, the length is stored as an integer. The maximum length: the initial string is 10^5, and each replacement can increase the length. But the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, and the expansion is built from the replacements. The length for a digit is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in its replacement string. \n\n        However, the length might be huge (exponential in the number of queries) and we cannot store such a huge integer.\n\n        Alternative: we don't store the entire length as an integer, but we store the length modulo (phi(1000000007))? But wait: the shifting factor is 10^(length) mod 1000000007. We can compute 10^(length) mod 1000000007 using modular exponentiation with exponent being length mod (1000000006) (by Euler). But we need the exponent (the length) to be reduced modulo 1000000006. However, the length is used in two places:\n\n          1. In the exponentiation for shifting: we need 10^(length) mod 1000000007.\n          2. When building the value: we do (current_value * (10^length)) + value_of_expansion.\n\n        But wait: the value_of_expansion is stored modulo 1000000007, and the length is the total number of digits, which is necessary to know the exponent for the base 10.\n\n        However, we cannot store the exact length if it is too big. But note: the problem constraints say that the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5. But the expansion length might be huge (like 10^5 * (max expansion factor per query) and we have 10^5 queries). \n\n        But wait: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the raw replacement strings, but the expansion might be much longer. However, the problem does not bound the expansion length.\n\n        We need an alternative: instead of storing the entire length, we store the length modulo (1000000006) for the purpose of exponentiation? \n\n        But note: the shifting factor is 10^(length) mod 1000000007. We can compute that by:\n\n            shift = pow(10, length, 1000000007)\n\n        But if length is huge, we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (Euler's theorem) because 10 and 1000000007 are coprime. Then:\n\n            shift = pow(10, length % 1000000006, 1000000007)\n\n        However, we must note: the formula for modular exponentiation with modulus m and base b requires that the exponent is reduced modulo phi(m) only if b and m are coprime, which they are. But Euler's theorem says:\n\n            b^phi(m) ≡ 1 mod m, so we can write exponent = k * phi(m) + r, then b^exponent ≡ (b^phi(m))^k * b^r ≡ 1^k * b^r ≡ b^r mod m.\n\n        So we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n        Therefore, we can store the length modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of exponentiation. But wait: the length is used only for the exponentiation? Actually, no: the length is also used to determine the shifting factor. However, the shifting factor is determined by the total length, and the total length is the sum of the lengths of the digits in the expansion. \n\n        But note: the length is the total number of digits, and the value is built by:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit d in the string (after expansion):\n                result = (result * 10 + digit_value) % MOD\n\n        However, the above is equivalent to:\n\n            Let the final string be d0 d1 d2 ... d_{k-1} (k digits)\n            Then the number is: d0 * 10^(k-1) + d1 * 10^(k-2) + ... + d_{k-1}\n\n        But in our DP, we are processing the string from left to right and we know the expansion for each digit. We can compute the entire number by:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit c in the original string (which is not expanded yet):\n                Let (v, L) = trans[c]   # v is the value of the expansion (mod MOD), and L is the length (number of digits) of the expansion (we store L_mod = L mod 1000000006 for the exponentiation, but wait: the length is used in the shifting factor, and we use the exponentiation with modulus 1000000007 and exponent reduced by 1000000006)\n\n        However, the value v is computed by the same method (concatenating the expansions). But note: the value v is computed modulo 1000000007, and the shifting factor is 10^L mod 1000000007, but we are storing L as an integer (the exact length) and then reducing it modulo 1000000006 for the exponentiation.\n\n        The problem: the length L might be too big to store as an integer (like having millions of digits). \n\n        We must store the length modulo 1000000006. But wait: the length is the total number of digits, and we are adding the lengths of the expansions. The length is used only for the exponentiation, so we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n        However, caution: the length is used in two ways:\n\n          - In the exponentiation: we need the exponent mod 1000000006.\n          - In the computation of the value for a digit: the value is built by the expansion, and the expansion of a digit d is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string. \n\n        But note: the value of the expansion for a digit d is built by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each char c in t:\n                (v, L) = trans[c]   # but we are storing L mod 1000000006? Then we can use that to compute the exponent for the shifting.\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                value = (value * (10^L) + v) % MOD\n\n        But wait, if we store the length as an integer, we can compute the exponentiation. However, if we store the length modulo 1000000006, then we can compute the exponentiation. But the problem is that the length is the total number of digits, and the shifting factor is 10^(L) mod MOD, and we can compute that by pow(10, L_mod, MOD) because by Euler.\n\n        However, the value of the expansion for a digit d is built by:\n\n            Let t = the replacement string for d.\n\n            Then, the expansion is the concatenation of the expansions of each char in t.\n\n            The value is computed by:\n\n                result = 0\n                for each char c in t:\n                    (v, len_c) = trans[c]   # Here, we are storing the length as an integer? Or as modulo 1000000006?\n                    result = (result * (10^len_c) + v) % MOD\n\n            And the total length is the sum of len_c for all c in t.\n\n        But if we store the length as modulo 1000000006, then we can compute the total length modulo 1000000006 by:\n\n                total_length = (sum of len_c for all c in t) % 1000000006\n\n        However, wait: the length is the total number of digits, and the shifting factor for the entire expansion of d is 10^(total_length) mod MOD. But the value of d's expansion is built by the above computation, and the shifting factor for the entire expansion of d is 10^(total_length) mod MOD.\n\n        But note: the expansion for d is the entire string, and when we use d in a larger context, we shift the current result by total_length digits and then add the value.\n\n        However, the value we compute for d (v) is the entire number represented by the expansion, modulo MOD. And the length (total_length) is the total number of digits, modulo 1000000006.\n\n        Then, when we use d in the initial string, we do:\n\n            result = (result * (10^(total_length)) + v) % MOD\n\n        So we need to compute 10^(total_length) mod MOD, and we can do that with:\n\n            shift = pow(10, total_length_mod, MOD)   # where total_length_mod = total_length % 1000000006\n\n        But wait: the total_length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the characters in t. And we are storing the length for each digit as an integer? Or as modulo 1000000006? \n\n        We have two options:\n\n          Option 1: Store the length as an integer (the exact length). But the length might be too big (exponential in the number of queries) and we cannot store that.\n\n          Option 2: Store the length modulo 1000000006. Then, we can compute the exponentiation. But note: the length is the total number of digits, and we are using it only for the exponentiation (for shifting). However, the value of the expansion (v) is computed by the same method (using the stored lengths modulo 1000000006 for the exponentiation). \n\n        But wait: the computation of the value for d:\n\n            We break t into characters, and for each character c we have (v_c, L_c) where L_c is stored modulo 1000000006.\n\n            Then, to compute the value for d:\n\n                value_d = 0\n                for each c in t:\n                    value_d = (value_d * (10^(L_c)) + v_c) % MOD\n\n            And the total_length_d = (sum of L_c for all c in t) % 1000000006\n\n        Then, we set trans[d] = (value_d, total_length_d)\n\n        However, note: the exponentiation uses L_c (the length of the expansion of c) and we are storing L_c modulo 1000000006. But the exponentiation requires the exponent to be the total number of digits (the length) of the expansion of c. We are storing that total number of digits modulo 1000000006. \n\n        This is valid because 10^(L_c) mod MOD = 10^(L_c mod 1000000006) mod MOD, by Euler's theorem (since 10 and MOD are coprime).\n\n        Therefore, we can store the length for each digit as an integer modulo 1000000006.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let MOD = 1000000007\n          Let PHI = 1000000006   (because MOD is prime, and we use Euler's theorem for base 10)\n\n          Initialize for each digit d from '0' to '9':\n              value[d] = int(d)\n              length[d] = 1   (but then we take modulo PHI for storage? Actually, we store length[d] = 1 % PHI, but 1 is less than PHI, so we store 1)\n\n          Then, read n queries.\n\n          Then, process the queries from last to first (i.e., from the last query to the first query):\n\n            For a query (d, t): \n                new_value = 0\n                new_length = 0   (this will be the total length of the expansion for d, modulo PHI)\n\n                For each char c in t:\n                    Let v = value[c], and L = length[c]   (both stored modulo their respective mods, but note: for value we store modulo MOD, for length modulo PHI)\n\n                    Then, we do:\n\n                    new_value = (new_value * (pow(10, L, MOD)) + v) % MOD\n\n                    And then, we add L to new_length: new_length = (new_length + L) % PHI\n\n                Then, set value[d] = new_value\n                Then, set length[d] = new_length\n\n          Then, after processing all queries, process the initial string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                v = value[c]\n                L = length[c]\n                result = (result * (pow(10, L, MOD)) + v) % MOD\n\n          Print result\n\n        But wait: the above computation for new_value for d uses the current stored value and length for each char in t. And we are updating d's transformation. Since we are processing backwards, the current stored values for the chars in t are the transformations that include all the queries that occur after the current one (because we are processing from last to first).\n\n        Example: the example \"222\", queries: [\"2->0\", \"0->7\"]\n\n        MOD = 1000000007, PHI = 1000000006.\n\n        Initialization: \n            value: for '0'=0, '1'=1, ... '9'=9\n            length: for each digit, 1 (mod PHI)\n\n        Process the last query: \"0->7\"\n            d='0', t=\"7\"\n            For c in \"7\": \n                v = value['7'] = 7\n                L = length['7'] = 1\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 7 = 7\n                new_length = 0 + 1 = 1\n            So, set value['0'] = 7, length['0'] = 1.\n\n        Then process the first query: \"2->0\"\n            d='2', t=\"0\"\n            For c in \"0\":\n                v = value['0'] (which is now 7)\n                L = length['0'] (which is 1)\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 7 = 7\n                new_length = 0 + 1 = 1\n            Set value['2'] = 7, length['2'] = 1.\n\n        Then, the initial string \"222\" is processed:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each '2': \n                result = (0 * (10^1) + 7) = 7\n            then (7 * (10^1) + 7) = 77\n            then (77 * (10^1) + 7) = 777.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\", \n            Expected output: 10031003.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Initial string: \"123123\"\n            Query: \"2->00\"\n\n            We process the query (only one, so last and first is the same).\n\n            d='2', t=\"00\"\n\n            We break t into ['0','0']\n\n            For each '0' (at the time of processing, we haven't processed any query after this one, so we use the base state for '0'):\n\n                value0 = 0, length0 = 1.\n\n            Then, for the first '0':\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n            Then, for the second '0':\n                new_value = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n\n            So, value['2'] = 0, length['2'] = (1+1) % PHI = 2.\n\n            Then, process the initial string \"123123\":\n\n                For '1': (1,1) -> result = 1\n                For '2': (0,2) -> result = (1 * (10^2) + 0) = 100\n                For '3': (3,1) -> result",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The final transformed string is then interpreted as a decimal number, and we need to compute its remainder when divided by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations, especially since the replacements can be nested and the string can become very large.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string with a specified string. The key observation is that each query's effect must be applied in sequence, and subsequent queries can affect digits introduced by previous replacements. Directly processing each query by scanning and replacing in the original string would be inefficient due to the potentially exponential growth of the string length.\n\n2. **Insight**: Instead of processing the string directly for each query, we can reverse-engineer the transformations. For each digit (0-9), we precompute its final value and the length of its expansion after all queries. This allows us to handle the entire transformation in linear time relative to the initial string length, regardless of the number of queries.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to track two values for each digit:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the digit's final expansion modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The total number of digits in the final expansion, modulo 1000000006 (since we use Euler's theorem for efficient exponentiation).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order, and for each query, it processes each character in the replacement string. The total operations are linear with respect to the sum of the lengths of all replacement strings, which is bounded by 10^5. The final processing of the initial string is also linear in its length (up to 10^5). Thus, the overall complexity is O(N + M), where N is the initial string length and M is the total length of all replacement strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nPHI = 1000000006\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries.append(input().strip())\n    \n    value = {}\n    length_mod = {}\n    \n    for digit in map(str, range(10)):\n        value[digit] = int(digit)\n        length_mod[digit] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        parts = queries[i].split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        \n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            if char in value:\n                v_part = value[char]\n                L_part = length_mod[char]\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, L_part, MOD) + v_part) % MOD\n                new_len = (new_len + L_part) % PHI\n            else:\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, 1, MOD) + int(char)) % MOD\n                new_len = (new_len + 1) % PHI\n        \n        value[d] = new_val\n        length_mod[d] = new_len\n    \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        v_char = value[char]\n        L_char = length_mod[char]\n        result = (result * pow(10, L_char, MOD) + v_char) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the initial string and the number of queries. Each query is stored for later processing.\n2. **Base Setup**: For each digit from '0' to '9', we initialize its base value (the digit itself) and length (1 digit).\n3. **Reverse Processing**: We process each query in reverse order. For each query, we compute the new value and length of the digit being replaced by considering its replacement string. The new value is computed by concatenating the values of each character in the replacement string, using modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable. The new length is the sum of the lengths of each character's expansion in the replacement string.\n4. **Final Computation**: After processing all queries, we transform the initial string by replacing each digit with its final value and length. The result is computed by iteratively combining these values, using the stored lengths to determine the appropriate powers of 10 for shifting.\n5. **Output**: The final result, which is the number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially massive growth of the string by leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
