The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) and one of m integers (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open a chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning they must have opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd.\n   If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\n We can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups: \n      even_chests: where a_i % 2 == 0\n      odd_chests: where a_i % 2 == 1\n\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups:\n      even_keys: where b_j % 2 == 0\n      odd_keys: where b_j % 2 == 1\n\n 3. Now, an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n 4. Therefore, we can form two bipartite matchings:\n\n    Matching 1: even_chests with odd_keys\n    Matching 2: odd_chests with even_keys\n\n 5. However, note that the same key cannot be used twice. But the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, so we can independently consider:\n\n    Let x = number of even_chests\n    Let y = number of odd_chests\n\n    Let p = number of even_keys\n    Let q = number of odd_keys\n\n 6. But wait: the matching is not necessarily complete because we have two independent sets? Actually, we can use:\n\n    For even_chests: we need odd_keys. The maximum matching from even_chests to odd_keys is limited by the minimum of (number of even_chests, number of odd_keys) but note: we don't require a complete matching in the bipartite graph? However, we are allowed to use each key only once.\n\n    Actually, the problem reduces to:\n\n        We have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n            Graph1: even_chests (x nodes) connected to odd_keys (q nodes) -> but actually, every even_chest can use any odd_key? Yes, because the condition is purely about parity. So the entire set of even_chests can be matched to any subset of odd_keys of size at most min(x, q).\n\n            Similarly, Graph2: odd_chests (y nodes) connected to even_keys (p nodes) -> maximum matching is min(y, p).\n\n 7. However, wait: are these two independent? The entire set of keys is partitioned into even and odd. And the entire set of chests is partitioned into even and odd. Since the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, the two matchings do not interfere.\n\n 8. Therefore, the total number of chests we can open is:\n\n        min(x, q) + min(y, p)\n\n But let's validate with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n     Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n     Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] \n        even_chests: [14, 6, 2] -> x = 3\n        odd_chests: [9, 11] -> y = 2\n\n     Keys: [8,4,7,20]\n        even_keys: [8,4,20] -> p = 3\n        odd_keys: [7] -> q = 1\n\n     Then, total = min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> which matches.\n\n Example 2:\n     Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n     Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> x=5, y=0\n     Keys: [5] -> odd -> q=1, p=0\n\n     Total = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n     Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n     Chests: [10] -> even -> x=1, y=0\n     Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> p=4, q=0\n\n     Total = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: what if there is a chest with even number and we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that the parities of the chest and key must be different (one even and one odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - **Chests**: Divide them into two groups—those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - **Keys**: Similarly, divide them into even-numbered and odd-numbered keys.\n\n2. **Matching Based on Parity**:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openings**:\n   - For even-numbered chests, the maximum number that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even-numbered chests and the count of odd-numbered keys.\n   - For odd-numbered chests, the maximum number that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd-numbered chests and the count of even-numbered keys.\n   - The total maximum chests Neko can open is the sum of these two minima.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    odd_chests = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chests += 1\n            \n    even_keys = 0\n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n        else:\n            odd_keys += 1\n            \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Chests and Keys by Parity**: The chests and keys are separated into even and odd counts based on their numbers.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa. The result is the sum of the minimum counts from both matchings.\n4. **Output the Result**: The final result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
