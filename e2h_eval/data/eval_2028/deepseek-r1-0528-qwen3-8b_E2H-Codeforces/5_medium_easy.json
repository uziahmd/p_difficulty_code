Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form the maximum number of pairs (one left and one right) such that the colors are compatible.\n\n Conditions for compatibility:\n  - Two specific colors (non '?') must be equal.\n  - An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color.\n\n However, note: we cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have two types of boots: those with fixed colors and those with '?'.\n\n We can think of two kinds of pairs:\n  1. Both boots have fixed colors (and they are the same).\n  2. One or both are '?'.\n\n But note: if we have a '?' on the left and a '?' on the right, they can form a pair.\n\n However, we want the maximum number of pairs.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the total pairs cannot exceed n (since there are n left and n right).\n\n 2. We can first try to match as many fixed-fixed pairs as possible. But note: sometimes using a '?' might be necessary to free up a fixed color that is already used in a different way? Actually, no: because '?' can match any, so we can leave fixed ones for matching fixed ones, and use '?' for matching when fixed ones are not available.\n\n However, the problem is that we have two independent sets (left and right). The idea is:\n\n  - We can form a pair between a left boot and a right boot if:\n      (a) l[i] == r[j] (if both are non '?')\n      (b) or at least one is '?'\n\n But note: the condition says an indefinite color is compatible with any. So if either is '?', then the pair is allowed.\n\n However, we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n  Part 1: Matching fixed colors (without '?') with the same color.\n\n  But note: if we have a fixed color on the left and a fixed color on the right, then they must be the same to form a pair.\n\n  However, what about using a '?' to match a fixed color? That might be necessary if the fixed color appears too few times to use all the '?'? Actually, we are trying to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  Let's consider that we have two strings: `l` and `r`. We can form a bipartite graph where left nodes are indices of `l` and right nodes are indices of `r`, and an edge exists between i and j if:\n      l[i] == r[j] OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?') OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is anything) OR (l[i] is anything and r[j]=='?')\n\n  Actually, the condition is: \n      If l[i] == '?' OR r[j] == '?', then the pair is allowed.\n\n  But wait: the condition is also that if both are fixed then they must be the same. So actually, we can write:\n\n      compatible(i, j) = True if (l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?' or l[i] == r[j])\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"An indefinite color is compatible with any\", so:\n\n      If l[i] is a letter and r[j] is a letter, then they must be the same.\n      If at least one is '?', then it's compatible.\n\n  So we can define:\n      if l[i] != '?' and r[j] != '?':\n          then we require l[i] == r[j]\n      else:\n          True\n\n  But note: we can also have one fixed and the other '?'. That is allowed.\n\n  Now, we wish to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph? However, n can be up to 150000, so we cannot use a general bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft-Karp or DFS based) because the graph is dense (each node on the left is connected to many on the right).\n\n  But note: the graph is defined by two strings. The edges are:\n\n      For each left index i and right index j:\n          if (l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?' or l[i] == r[j]) then edge exists.\n\n  This is a very structured graph.\n\n  However, note: we are only allowed to use each boot once.\n\n  How to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n  We can try to use greedy? But note: sometimes we have a choice. For example, if we have multiple '?'s, we might use them to cover multiple possibilities.\n\n  Another idea: separate the boots into two sets: fixed boots and '?' boots.\n\n  Let:\n      L_fixed = [i for i, color in enumerate(l) if color != '?']\n      R_fixed = [j for j, color in enumerate(r) if r[j] != '?']\n\n  And then we have the '?' boots.\n\n  Step 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots.\n\n      We can create a frequency map for the fixed colors in the left and the fixed colors in the right.\n\n      However, note: the fixed boots are at specific positions. We cannot just assign arbitrarily because the same color might appear multiple times and we have to respect the one-to-one matching.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          Count the fixed colors in left and right and then for each color c, the number of pairs we can form from fixed boots is min(count_left[c], count_right[c]). But wait: we cannot use the same boot twice, and we are considering fixed boots only. However, the positions matter because we are going to output the indices.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to use any fixed boots that are of the same color, but we cannot use a fixed boot in two pairs.\n\n      However, we can do:\n\n          We want to match as many fixed boots as possible. Then, the remaining boots (which include the unmatched fixed boots and all the '?' boots) can be matched arbitrarily (because a '?' matches everything). \n\n      But wait: the '?' boots are also available. Actually, we can use the '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots (if any) and then the rest of the '?' boots can be matched together.\n\n      However, the problem is: we wish to maximize the total pairs. The total pairs cannot exceed n (which is the number of boots per leg). The maximum pairs is the minimum of the total boots (n) but we have two legs.\n\n      Actually, the maximum pairs is n (if we can form n pairs). But note: we have n left and n right.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          1. We can form pairs from fixed boots that are the same. But we can also use '?' to match fixed boots (if a fixed boot is left unmatched, then we can match it with a '?' from either side, provided we haven't used that '?' already). Similarly, we can use a '?' from the left to match a fixed boot on the right.\n\n      However, we can use a two-step process:\n\n          Step A: Match fixed boots with fixed boots (same color). But we must do this without interfering with the '?' boots. \n\n          Step B: Then, use the '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots (if any) and then match the remaining '?' boots among themselves.\n\n      But note: we might get more pairs if we reserve some '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots, and then the rest of the '?' boots can be matched arbitrarily. However, the matching of fixed boots and fixed boots is independent and must be done first? Actually, we can interleave: but the goal is maximum pairs.\n\n      Actually, we can consider:\n\n          Total pairs = min(n, number of fixed matches + min(remaining_left_fixed + remaining_right_fixed, number_of_question_marks))\n\n      But wait, the graph is bipartite and the edges are defined by the condition. We can use a greedy matching for fixed boots and then use the '?' boots to cover the rest.\n\n      However, note: the condition for fixed boots is strict: same color. So we can use a graph for fixed boots: but we have two sets: the left fixed and right fixed. We can build a bipartite graph for the fixed boots: only edges when the color is the same.\n\n      Then, we can compute the maximum matching for fixed boots. But note: the graph for fixed boots is defined by: for each color c, we have a complete bipartite graph between left fixed boots with color c and right fixed boots with color c. And note: we cannot use a fixed boot twice.\n\n      Then, after matching as many fixed boots as possible, we have:\n\n          Let M = number of fixed boots pairs.\n\n          Then, we have n - M left boots and n - M right boots left (including fixed and '?').\n\n          Now, the remaining graph: every node (both left and right) that is a fixed boot (that wasn't matched) and every node that is a '?' can form an edge. So the remaining graph is a complete bipartite graph between the remaining left nodes and the remaining right nodes? \n\n          Actually, no: because the condition for remaining fixed boots (if any) is: they are fixed and must be matched with a '?' (because we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors, and we already matched the same color fixed boots). But note: the remaining fixed boots are of specific colors, and they can only be matched with a '?' (because the other fixed boots of the same color were already matched, and the other fixed boots of different colors are not allowed). \n\n          However, wait: the condition for fixed boots is that they must be matched with a fixed boot of the same color. So if we have a fixed boot left, then the only possibility to match it is with a '?' (from the opposite side). Similarly, if we have a '?' on one side, it can match any remaining node (fixed or '?').\n\n      So the remaining problem is: we have a bipartite graph with two sets (left_remaining and right_remaining). The edges are:\n\n          For a left node i (which is either fixed or '?'):\n              if it is fixed, then it can only connect to the right nodes that are '?' (because the fixed boots of the same color have been matched, and other fixed boots of different colors are not allowed).\n              if it is '?', then it can connect to any right node.\n\n          Similarly for the right node j.\n\n      But note: the condition is symmetric: the entire graph for the remaining part is:\n\n          Edge exists if:\n              (left_node is '?' OR right_node is '?' OR (left_node is fixed and right_node is fixed and left_node==right_node)) \n\n          However, the fixed boots of the same color have already been matched, so in the remaining set, the fixed boots are of colors that do not have enough right counterparts? Actually, no: we did the matching for fixed boots by color. So for each color, we matched as many as the minimum of left and right. Then, for a fixed color c, the remaining left fixed boots of color c can only be matched with '?' on the right, and vice versa.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note that the remaining graph is actually a complete bipartite graph for the '?' nodes, and the fixed boots (the unmatched ones) can only be matched with the '?' nodes.\n\n      But wait: can two fixed boots (of different colors) be matched? No. So the remaining graph is:\n\n          Left nodes: \n            Type F: fixed boots (with a specific color) that were not matched in the fixed matching.\n            Type Q: '?' boots.\n\n          Right nodes:\n            Type F: fixed boots (with a specific color) that were not matched in the fixed matching.\n            Type Q: '?' boots.\n\n          And edges:\n\n            - Between Type F (left) and Type Q (right): allowed (because the right is '?').\n            - Between Type F (left) and Type F (right): not allowed (unless they are the same color, but we already matched same colors, and if they are different then no, and same color would have been matched already).\n            - Between Type F (left) and Type F (right): not allowed (if the color is different) and if the same color, then we should have matched them already? Actually, we did the fixed matching by color, so if there are same color fixed boots left, that means we matched as many as possible (min(left_count, right_count) for each color). Therefore, the remaining fixed boots are of colors that either have no counterpart (so the other side doesn't have that color) or the counts are not exhausted, but note: we did the matching by color independently. Actually, for a fixed color c, we matched min(left_c, right_c). Then, left_c' = left_c - min(left_c, right_c) and right_c' = right_c - min(left_c, right_c). These leftover fixed boots cannot be matched with fixed boots (because for color c, the other side doesn't have enough, and for other colors, the condition requires same color). So they must be matched with '?'.\n\n            - Between Type Q (left) and Type F (right): allowed (because the left is '?').\n            - Between Type Q (left) and Type Q (right): allowed.\n\n      Therefore, the remaining graph is:\n\n          We have:\n            Let L_fixed_remaining = list of indices for fixed left boots that were not matched.\n            Let R_fixed_remaining = list of indices for fixed right boots that were not matched.\n\n            Let L_question = list of indices for '?' in left that were not matched (if any) -> note: initially, the '?' boots are not used in the fixed matching, so they are all remaining.\n            Let R_question = list of indices for '?' in right that were not matched.\n\n          Then, we can form:\n\n            Step 1: Match as many fixed boots (remaining) with '?' boots (on the opposite side) as possible.\n\n            Step 2: Then, match the remaining '?' boots (both sides) arbitrarily (each '?' can be matched with any '?'? Actually, the condition allows it). But note: we have two sets of '?' boots (left and right). The matching between the remaining '?' boots is a complete bipartite graph.\n\n          However, note: we have two independent ways to match:\n\n            We have a bipartite graph with two types of edges:\n\n              (a) Between L_fixed_remaining and R_question: these are edges (because L_fixed_remaining is fixed and R_question is '?') -> allowed.\n              (b) Between L_question and R_fixed_remaining: allowed.\n              (c) Between L_question and R_question: allowed.\n\n          But note: the fixed boots (remaining) can also be matched with the '?' boots on their own side? No: because the condition for a fixed boot (say color 'a') and a '?' on the same side? Actually, no: the left boot must be matched with the right boot. So the fixed boot on the left must be matched with a right boot (which must be '?' or fixed of the same color, but same color fixed boots are gone). So only with '?' on the right.\n\n          Similarly, a fixed boot on the right must be matched with a '?' on the left.\n\n      How to maximize the matching in the remaining graph?\n\n          The remaining graph is a bipartite graph with:\n\n            Left nodes: L_fixed_remaining âˆª L_question\n            Right nodes: R_fixed_remaining âˆª R_question\n\n          And edges:\n\n            From L_fixed_remaining to R_question (all edges)\n            From L_question to R_fixed_remaining (all edges)\n            From L_question to R_question (all edges)\n\n          Note: there are no edges from L_fixed_remaining to R_fixed_remaining (unless we consider same color, but we already matched same colors so the remaining fixed boots have no same color counterpart? Actually, no: we matched by color, so if a fixed boot of color 'a' is left on the left, then the right side must have no fixed boot of color 'a' left (because we matched all we could). So the remaining fixed boots on the left are of colors that are not present in the right (or insufficiently present). Therefore, the fixed boots on the left can only be matched with '?' on the right, and similarly for the right.\n\n          Now, we can model the remaining graph as:\n\n            We have two sets: the fixed boots (L_fixed_remaining and R_fixed_remaining) and the '?' boots (L_question and R_question).\n\n            We can use a flow or matching? But note: the graph is large (n up to 150000). We cannot use standard algorithms for general bipartite matching because the graph is dense.\n\n          However, note: the structure is very regular.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Step 1: Match L_fixed_remaining with R_question (as long as we have R_question available). Similarly, match R_fixed_remaining with L_question.\n\n            Then, the remaining '?' boots (both sides) form a complete bipartite graph. Then, the maximum matching in a complete bipartite graph of two sets (say, a complete graph between set A and set B) is min(|A|, |B|). But note: we can use a greedy matching for the fixed boots with the '?' boots, and then the remaining '?' boots can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n          But wait: we can also use the '?' boots to match the fixed boots on the opposite side, and then the remaining '?' boots can be matched together. However, the matching of fixed boots with '?' boots is constrained by the number of '?' boots on the opposite side.\n\n          Actually, we can combine:\n\n            Let x = |L_fixed_remaining|\n            Let y = |R_fixed_remaining|\n            Let a = |L_question|\n            Let b = |R_question|\n\n          Then, the maximum pairs we can form from the remaining graph is:\n\n            First, we can use up to min(x, b) from L_fixed_remaining and R_question.\n            Then, we can use up to min(y, a) from R_fixed_remaining and L_question.\n\n            Then, the remaining '?' boots (after using some to match the fixed boots) are:\n\n                Remaining L_question = a - min(y, a)   [but note: we are using L_question to match R_fixed_remaining, so we use min(y, a) from L_question to match R_fixed_remaining]\n\n            Then, the remaining R_question = b - min(x, b)\n\n            Then, we can match the remaining L_question and R_question arbitrarily, which is min( (a - min(y, a)), (b - min(x, b)) )?\n\n          However, wait: we can use the same '?' boot for matching fixed boots? Yes, but note: we have two separate uses:\n\n            - We use some of the R_question to match L_fixed_remaining (up to min(x, b)).\n            - We use some of the L_question to match R_fixed_remaining (up to min(y, a)).\n\n          Then, the remaining '?' boots are:\n\n            L_question_remaining = a - min(y, a)\n            R_question_remaining = b - min(x, b)\n\n          Then, we can match the remaining L_question_remaining and R_question_remaining arbitrarily (each left '?' can be matched with any right '?' that hasn't been used). The maximum matching for the complete bipartite graph between L_question_remaining and R_question_remaining is min(L_question_remaining, R_question_remaining).\n\n          Therefore, the total pairs from the remaining graph is:\n\n            pairs_remaining = min(x, b) + min(y, a) + min(L_question_remaining, R_question_remaining)\n\n          But note: we must subtract the fixed matching we already did (M) and then the remaining pairs (pairs_remaining) is added. However, the problem asks for the maximum total pairs.\n\n      However, wait: we are forming two independent sets. The fixed matching (step A) gives M. Then the remaining graph gives pairs_remaining. Then the total pairs is M + pairs_remaining.\n\n      But note: the entire set of left boots and right boots are being used in the fixed matching and the remaining matching. However, we must ensure that we don't double count.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute M (the matching for fixed boots) by color.\n\n        Step 2: Identify the remaining fixed boots and the remaining '?' boots.\n\n        Step 3: Use the remaining '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots (on the opposite side) as much as possible.\n\n        Step 4: Then, use the leftover '?' boots to form pairs.\n\n      However, note: the problem does not require us to output the matching for fixed boots separately, but we must output the pairs (the indices). And the pairs must be distinct.\n\n      Implementation:\n\n        We need to output the pairs. So we have to record the indices.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Step 1: For fixed boots, we want to match as many as possible. We can do:\n\n            Build a dictionary for left fixed boots: mapping color -> list of indices (for left) that are fixed and not '?'.\n            Similarly for right.\n\n            Then, for each color c, we take min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) and then we need to choose which ones to match. But note: we have to output the pairs, so we need to remember the indices.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Create two dictionaries for left and right: \n                    left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n                    right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\n                For i, color in enumerate(l):\n                    if color != '?':\n                        left_dict[color].append(i+1)   # because the problem indices are 1-indexed? The input uses 1-indexed indices? Actually, the example: \n                            Input: \n                                10\n                                codeforces\n                                dodivthree\n                            Output: \n                                5\n                                7 8\n                                4 9\n                                2 2\n                                9 10\n                                3 1\n\n                Wait, the example output uses indices starting at 1 and 1. The problem says: the j-th line should contain the index a_j (left boot index) and index b_j (right boot index). The boots are numbered from 1 to n for left and 1 to n for right? Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th character stands for the i-th left boot\", so the indices are from 1 to n.\n\n                So we store the indices as 1-indexed.\n\n            Then, we can iterate over the colors and for each color c, we take the smallest min(left_dict[c], right_dict[c]) indices from left and right? Actually, we don't care about the order as long as we don't use the same index twice. But note: we must output the pairs arbitrarily (any optimal answer).\n\n            However, we are going to use the fixed matching first, and then the '?' matching.\n\n            We can:\n\n                M = 0\n                fixed_left_indices = []   # we'll mark which fixed left boots are used in fixed matching\n                fixed_right_indices = []\n\n                for color in set(left_dict.keys()) | set(right_dict.keys()):\n                    left_list = left_dict.get(color, [])\n                    right_list = right_dict.get(color, [])\n                    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                    # We take the first k from left_list and right_list? Actually, we need to assign arbitrarily. But we want to remember which indices we use.\n\n                    # But note: the same index may appear in multiple colors? No, because each left boot has one color.\n\n                    # We can sort the lists? We don't know if the indices are sorted. Actually, we collected the indices in order of appearance.\n\n                    # We can use a pointer for each color? Or simply take the first k from each list.\n\n                    # But note: we are going to use the remaining fixed boots in step 3. So we need to know which fixed boots are left.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    For each color, we take the first min(left_dict[color], right_dict[color]) pairs from the two lists (we can sort the lists to take the smallest indices? Actually, we don't care about the order as long as we output distinct indices. But the problem does not specify an order.\n\n                However, we must avoid using the same index twice.\n\n            Steps for fixed matching:\n\n                We can use a matching algorithm for each color? But note: the fixed boots of the same color form a complete bipartite graph. We can use a simple greedy: for each color, match the first min(left_dict[color], right_dict[color]) left boots of that color with the first min(left_dict[color], right_dict[color]) right boots of that color.\n\n                But wait: we don't require the smallest indices necessarily. However, we want to reserve the larger indices for the '?' matching? Actually, no: because in the '?' matching, we don't care which fixed boot is matched with which '?'. So we can use any.\n\n            But note: the problem does not specify which pairs to output. So we can output any.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: we are going to remove the fixed boots that are matched from the fixed sets, and then use the remaining fixed boots (which we have stored) to see if they can be matched with '?'.\n\n            So:\n\n                For each color c:\n                    left_list = sorted(left_dict[c])   # but we don't need to sort, we can use the list as is?\n                    right_list = sorted(right_dict[c])\n                    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                    Then, we take the first k from left_list and the first k from right_list? Actually, we can take any k. But if we take the first k, we are using the smallest indices. Then, the remaining fixed boots (the ones not chosen) will be the rest. But note: we don't know if the smallest indices are going to be used in the '?' matching? It doesn't matter.\n\n            However, we must avoid using the same index twice. Since we are storing the indices, we can mark them as used.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                We create two arrays: used_left and used_right, initially all False.\n\n                Then, for each color c:\n\n                    left_list = [index for index in left_dict[c] if not used_left[index-1]]   # but we don't know which indices are used in fixed matching for other colors? Actually, we are processing by color, so we can use the same index in different colors? No, because each index is one boot.\n\n                But wait: we are processing by color, and the same index appears only once (because each left boot has one color). So we can simply:\n\n                    For each color c, we take the list of left indices for c and the list of right indices for c.\n\n                    Then, we match the smallest min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) indices from left_list with the same from right_list? Actually, we can use any matching. We don't care which one is matched with which, as long as we record the pair.\n\n                Then, we mark those left indices and right indices as used.\n\n            But wait: the problem requires the pairs to be output. We have to output the pairs in the fixed matching.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                fixed_matches = []   # list of tuples (left_index, right_index)\n\n                for color in set(left_dict.keys()) | set(right_dict.keys()):\n                    left_list = left_dict.get(color, [])\n                    right_list = right_dict.get(color, [])\n                    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                    # We can sort the left_list and right_list to get the smallest indices? Actually, we don't care about the order of the pairs, but we must output the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n                    # But note: the problem output example does not specify an order. We can output the pairs in any order.\n\n                    # However, we must use distinct indices.\n\n                    # We can simply take the first k from left_list and the first k from right_list (if we don't sort, then the order of collection might be arbitrary). But the problem does not specify.\n\n                    # Actually, we don't even need to sort. We can use the first k elements (the ones that appeared first in our collection). But our collection is in increasing index order? Not necessarily.\n\n                    # Example: \n                    #   l = \"abac\" -> then left_dict['a'] = [0,2] (if 0-indexed) -> then we take the first k= min(2, ...) but we don't know the order.\n\n                    # But note: the problem does not require a particular order. We can output the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n                    # However, the problem example output uses indices that are not sorted. But we must output the pairs with the left boot index and the right boot index.\n\n                    # Let's do: \n                    left_list.sort()\n                    right_list.sort()\n                    for i in range(k):\n                        # match left_list[i] and right_list[i]\n                        fixed_matches.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n                    And then mark these indices as used.\n\n                But wait: we cannot mark by the value of the index because the same index might appear in different colors? No, because each boot has one color.\n\n            However, we must avoid using the same boot twice. We are storing the indices. So we can mark the left indices and right indices as used.\n\n            We can have:\n\n                used_left = [False]*(n+1)   # 1-indexed: index from 1 to n\n                used_right = [False]*(n+1)\n\n                Then, for each color, we take the left_list and right_list, and then for i in range(k):\n                    left_index = left_list[i]\n                    right_index = right_list[i]\n                    fixed_matches.append( (left_index, right_index) )\n                    used_left[left_index] = True\n                    used_right[right_index] = True\n\n            Then, the remaining fixed boots are the ones that are not used.\n\n            Then, we can extract:\n\n                L_fixed_remaining = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if not used_left[i] and l[i-1]!='?']\n                R_fixed_remaining = [j for j in range(1, n+1) if not used_right[j] and r[j-1]!='?']\n\n            But wait: we have to be careful: the fixed boots that are not used are the ones that are fixed and not matched.\n\n            Then, the '?' boots:\n\n                L_question = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if not used_left[i] and l[i-1]=='?']\n                R_question = [j for j in range(1, n+1) if not used_right[j] and r[j-1]=='?']\n\n            Then, we can form:\n\n                Step 3: Match the remaining fixed boots (from left) with the '?' boots (from right). How many? min(len(L_fixed_remaining), len(R_question))\n\n                Similarly, match the remaining fixed boots (from right) with the '?' boots (from left): min(len(R_fixed_remaining), len(L_question))\n\n            Then, the remaining '?' boots:\n\n                L_question_remaining = [i for i in L_question if i not in ...?] \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                We have two sets of indices for the '?' boots (L_question and R_question). Then:\n\n                Let x = len(L_fixed_remaining)\n                Let y = len(R_fixed_remaining)\n                Let a = len(L_question)\n                Let b = len(R_question)\n\n                Then, we can form:\n\n                  pairs_from_fixed_to_question = min(x, b) + min(y, a)\n\n                Then, we use:\n\n                  We use min(x, b) of R_question (for matching with L_fixed_remaining) and min(y, a) of L_question (for matching with R_fixed_remaining).\n\n                Then, the remaining '?' boots:\n\n                  L_question_remaining = L_question minus the ones used (min(y, a) of them) -> actually, we use min(y, a) from L_question (the ones that are '?' on the left) to match R_fixed_remaining.\n\n                  Similarly, R_question_remaining = R_question minus the ones used (min(x, b) of them)\n\n                Then, we can form min(|L_question_remaining|, |R_question_remaining|) pairs from the remaining '?' boots.\n\n            But wait: we have to record the actual pairs. So we need to know which indices to use.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Step 1: Fixed matching (by color) -> we record the pairs.\n\n                Step 2: For the remaining fixed boots (L_fixed_remaining and R_fixed_remaining) and the '?' boots (L_question and R_question):\n\n                    We want to form:\n\n                      Type 1: (L_fixed_remaining element, R_question element) -> we can use any of the R_question for any of the L_fixed_remaining, as long as we don't use the same R_question twice.\n\n                    Similarly for Type 2.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    For Type 1: \n                        Let A = L_fixed_remaining (list of indices for left fixed remaining)\n                        Let B = R_question (list of indices for right '?')\n\n                        We want to form min(|A|, |B|) pairs. We can take the first min(|A|,|B|) from A and the first min(|A|,|B|) from B (sorted arbitrarily). But note: we don't care about the order.\n\n                    Similarly for Type 2.\n\n                Then, for the remaining '?' boots (both sides), we can form min(|A'|, |B'|) pairs, where A' = the remaining L_question (after Type 2) and B' = the remaining R_question (after Type 1).\n\n            However, we must output the pairs. We need to know the exact indices.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Step 1: Fixed matching: we have a list of fixed_matches.\n\n                Step 2: Mark used_left and used_right.\n\n                Step 3: Separate the remaining indices.\n\n                Step 4: For the remaining fixed boots (left) and the remaining '?' boots (right): we can arbitrarily match the smallest min(|A|,|B|) indices from A with the smallest min(|A|,|B|) indices from B.\n\n                But note: the problem does not specify the order.\n\n            However, we must output the pairs in the order of the pairs? The problem says: print k (the total pairs) and then k lines, each containing a pair (left index, right index).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) such that their colors match either by being the same specific color or by one or both being an indefinite color ('?'). The solution involves efficiently matching boots while ensuring no boot is used more than once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on color compatibility. A pair is compatible if both boots have the same color or at least one boot has an indefinite color ('?'). The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution can be broken down into two main parts:\n   - **Fixed Color Matching**: First, match boots with specific colors (non '?') that are the same. This is done by grouping boots by their colors and matching them in pairs.\n   - **Indefinite Color Matching**: After matching as many fixed color boots as possible, use the remaining '?' boots to match any leftover fixed color boots or form pairs among themselves.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Fixed Color Matching**: For each color, count the number of left and right boots. Match the minimum of these counts for each color.\n   - **Indefinite Color Matching**: Use the remaining '?' boots to match any unmatched fixed color boots. Then, pair the leftover '?' boots among themselves.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once for fixed color matching and once for indefinite color matching, resulting in an O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n â‰¤ 150,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char != '?':\n            left_dict[char].append(i+1)\n            \n    for j, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char != '?':\n            right_dict[char].append(j+1)\n            \n    used_left = [False] * (n+1)\n    used_right = [False] * (n+1)\n    fixed_matches = []\n    \n    for char in set(left_dict.keys()) | set(right_dict.keys()):\n        left_list = left_dict[char]\n        right_list = right_dict[char]\n        k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        left_list.sort()\n        right_list.sort()\n        for idx in range(k):\n            left_idx = left_list[idx]\n            right_idx = right_list[idx]\n            fixed_matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n            \n    remaining_pairs = []\n    \n    L_fixed_remaining = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            L_fixed_remaining.append(i)\n            \n    R_fixed_remaining = []\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n        if not used_right[j]:\n            R_fixed_remaining.append(j)\n            \n    L_question_remaining = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not used_left[i] and l_str[i-1] == '?':\n            L_question_remaining.append(i)\n            \n    R_question_remaining = []\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n        if not used_right[j] and r_str[j-1] == '?':\n            R_question_remaining.append(j)\n            \n    part1 = min(len(L_fixed_remaining), len(R_question_remaining))\n    part2 = min(len(R_fixed_remaining), len(L_question_remaining))\n    part3 = min(len(L_question_remaining) - part2, len(R_question_remaining) - part1)\n    \n    for i in range(part1):\n        left_idx = L_fixed_remaining[i]\n        right_idx = R_question_remaining[i]\n        remaining_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        \n    for i in range(part2):\n        left_idx = L_question_remaining[i]\n        right_idx = R_fixed_remaining[i]\n        remaining_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        \n    for i in range(part3):\n        left_idx = L_question_remaining[part2 + i]\n        right_idx = R_question_remaining[part1 + i]\n        remaining_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        \n    total_pairs = fixed_matches + remaining_pairs\n    total_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    print(len(total_pairs))\n    for a, b in total_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Fixed Color Matching**: Boots with specific colors (non '?') are grouped by color. For each color, the minimum of left and right boots is matched, and these indices are marked as used.\n3. **Remaining Boots Handling**: After fixed color matching, any remaining boots (either fixed or '?') are processed. Fixed color boots are matched with '?' boots from the opposite side. Leftover '?' boots are paired among themselves.\n4. **Output**: The total pairs (fixed and remaining) are printed, sorted by left and right indices for clarity.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible boot pairs while ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.",
