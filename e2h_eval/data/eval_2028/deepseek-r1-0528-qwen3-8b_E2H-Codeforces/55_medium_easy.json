    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means:\n - '0' can be moved freely to the left (because we can swap 0 and 1, and then 1 and 2? Actually note: \n   However, note that we cannot swap 0 and 2. So the relative order of 0's and 2's is fixed unless there is a 1 in between.\n\nBut note: \n  We can only swap '0' with '1' and '1' with '2'. Therefore, we cannot directly swap a '0' with a '2'. However, we can use the '1's as intermediaries.\n\nObservation:\n  The operations allow us to rearrange the string arbitrarily as long as the relative order of the three types is constrained by the possibility of moving through the other type.\n\nActually, we can break down the problem:\n\n  Since we can move 0's arbitrarily to the left (by swapping with 1's) and 2's arbitrarily to the right (by swapping with 1's), but the 1's can be used to \"bridge\" the movement of 0's and 2's.\n\nHowever, note that we cannot change the relative order of two zeros, two ones, or two twos? Let's check:\n\n  Consider two zeros: they cannot be swapped because there's no operation that swaps two zeros. Similarly for two ones or two twos.\n\nBut wait, what about having zeros separated by ones? \n\n  Example: \"010\" -> we can swap the first two: \"100\", so the zeros can pass through each other? Actually, no: the zeros themselves cannot be swapped, but note that when we have two zeros and some ones in between, the zeros can \"bubble\" through the ones. Similarly, the ones can bubble through the zeros and the twos, and the twos can bubble through the ones.\n\nBut what about zeros and twos? Without a one, we cannot swap a zero and a two. So the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed? Not exactly: if there is a one between a zero and a two, then we can use the one to swap the zero and the one, then the one and the two, effectively moving the zero past the two. But wait, the operation allows swapping 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So:\n\n  Example: \"012\" -> \n      Step1: swap 0 and 1 -> \"102\"\n      Step2: swap 0 (now at position1) and 2 (at position2): not allowed, because we can't swap 0 and 2.\n  Alternatively, from \"012\": \n      We cannot swap 0 and 2 directly. But note: after swapping the 0 and 1, we get \"102\", then we can swap the 1 (which is now at the beginning) with nothing? Actually, we can then swap the 0 and the 2? No, because the operation for swapping 0 and 1 requires adjacent 0 and 1, and swapping 1 and 2 requires adjacent 1 and 2.\n\nWait, in \"102\": we have a '1' and a '2' adjacent? Yes, so we can swap them: \"102\" -> \"012\" again? That doesn't help.\n\nBut consider: \"012\" -> swap the 1 and 2 first? We cannot because the adjacent pair is \"1\" and \"2\", so we can swap them: \"021\". Then we can swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed.\n\nSo actually, we cannot move a zero past a two if there's no one to help? But wait, what if we have multiple ones?\n\nExample: \"001122\"\n\nWe want to know if we can rearrange the entire string arbitrarily. Actually, we cannot change the relative order of the zeros, the ones, and the twos arbitrarily. However, we can interleave them under the constraints:\n\n  - A '0' can only move to the left until it hits another '0' (because zeros cannot cross) or until it leaves the left side of all non-zeros?\n  - Similarly, a '2' can only move to the right until it hits another '2' or the right end.\n\nBut note: the ones can move both left and right (because they can swap with zeros and twos). \n\nActually, we can think of the problem as: we have three independent sequences (for '0','1','2') that must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, but we are allowed to interleave them arbitrarily provided that:\n\n  - The zeros can only pass through ones (from the right side of the zero to the left, and vice versa? Actually, the zero can move left through ones, and the one can move left through zeros. Similarly, the one can move right through zeros and left through zeros? Actually, the swaps are bidirectional.\n\nBut the key is: we cannot swap zeros and twos directly. Therefore, the relative order between zeros and twos is fixed unless there are ones that can be used to \"break\" the barrier. However, note:\n\n  In fact, the entire set of zeros and twos must remain in their original relative order, because:\n\n    - To move a zero to the right of a two, we would need to swap them, which is not allowed. And we cannot use ones to swap a zero and a two in one step, but we can use ones to help the zero go around the two? \n\nBut wait: consider the example \"02\". We cannot swap them. So the relative order of the zero and the two must remain the same.\n\nSimilarly, consider \"20\": we cannot swap them. So the relative order of the two and the zero must remain the same.\n\nTherefore, we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos. However, we can change the relative order of zeros and ones, and ones and twos.\n\nBut note: the relative order of zeros and ones can be changed arbitrarily (because zeros can move left through ones, and ones can move right through zeros). Similarly, the relative order of ones and twos can be changed arbitrarily.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n  We have three independent sets (the positions of zeros, ones, and twos) that must appear in the final string in the same relative order as in the original string. However, we can interleave these sets arbitrarily as long as:\n\n    - The zeros and ones can be arbitrarily interleaved (so the zeros can be placed arbitrarily relative to the ones, except that the zeros must appear in increasing order of their original indices, and similarly the ones must appear in increasing order of their original indices).\n\n    - Similarly, the ones and twos can be arbitrarily interleaved.\n\n    - But the zeros and twos cannot be arbitrarily interleaved: the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as in the original string.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: we must output a string that has:\n\n  - All the zeros and ones interleaved arbitrarily (to get the minimum lexicographical string, we want as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then ones, then twos? But wait: we cannot put a two before a zero if originally the zero came before the two? Actually, no: the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved.\n\nWait, let me clarify: \n\n  The condition is: the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as in the original string. Similarly, the relative order of zeros and ones can be arbitrary (but the zeros must appear in the order they were originally, and the ones too) and the relative order of ones and twos can be arbitrary.\n\nBut note: the entire set of zeros, ones, and twos must appear in the same relative order as in the original string? Actually, no: the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same, and the relative order of zeros and ones can be arbitrary, and the relative order of ones and twos can be arbitrary.\n\nHowever, the entire set of zeros, ones, and twos must appear in the same relative order as in the original string? Actually, no: the operations do not allow swapping two different types arbitrarily. The zeros and ones can be arbitrarily rearranged relative to each other, and the ones and twos can be arbitrarily rearranged relative to each other, but zeros and twos cannot be rearranged relative to each other.\n\nSo, the zeros must appear in the string in the order of their original indices, and the twos must appear in the order of their original indices, and the ones can be placed arbitrarily with respect to zeros and twos, but the zeros and twos must maintain their original relative order.\n\nWait, that is not entirely true. Actually, the zeros and ones can be arbitrarily rearranged (relative to each other) because they can swap. Similarly, the ones and twos can be arbitrarily rearranged. But the zeros and twos cannot swap directly. However, if there is an intermediary one, then a zero and a two can \"pass\" each other via the one? Let me try:\n\n  Original: \"012\" -> we saw we cannot swap 0 and 2. Now, what if we have more ones?\n\n  Example: \"0112\" \n      We can do:\n          Swap the last two ones: not allowed (same character) -> no.\n          We can move the zeros to the left and the twos to the right arbitrarily, but the zeros and twos must preserve their relative order.\n\n      But note: the original string has a zero and then a two. In the desired minimum lexicographical string, we want zeros at the front, then ones, then twos. However, we cannot put the two before the zero because that would reverse the relative order of the zero and two.\n\n      But wait: in the original string, the zero comes first and then the two. So in the final string, the zero must come before the two? \n\n      However, we can put the two anywhere as long as the zero is before it? Actually, no: the relative order of the zero and two must be the same as in the original. Since the zero is originally before the two, the zero must remain before the two.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot put the two before the zero.\n\n      Similarly, if we have a two and then a zero, we cannot put the zero before the two.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n  - The zeros must appear in the original order (i.e., if there are two zeros, the first zero in the original string must appear before the second zero in the original string in the final string).\n  - The twos must appear in the original order.\n\nBut the ones can be placed arbitrarily.\n\nNow, how to solve:\n\n  We know that the zeros and twos must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, and the ones can be inserted arbitrarily.\n\n  We can use a greedy approach:\n\n  We want the lexicographically smallest string. The lexicographical order is defined by:\n\n      '0' < '1' < '2'\n\n  Therefore, we want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then ones, then twos. However, we cannot break the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n  But note: we can insert ones arbitrarily. So the idea is:\n\n  We can separate the string into zeros and non-zeros (where non-zeros are either ones or twos). However, the non-zeros must preserve the relative order of the zeros and the twos.\n\n  Actually, we can think of the problem as: we have three independent chains (zeros, ones, twos) and we are allowed to merge them arbitrarily, but the zeros chain and the twos chain must be merged without changing their relative order, and the ones chain can be inserted arbitrarily.\n\n  However, note: the ones can also be interleaved with the zeros and twos arbitrarily, but the zeros and twos must maintain their relative order.\n\n  We can break the problem into:\n\n  Step 1: Extract the positions of zeros, ones, and twos.\n\n  Then, we can consider that the final string must contain:\n\n      All zeros in the order of their original occurrence, but we can insert ones and twos arbitrarily in between, but note: the twos must also appear in their original relative order.\n\n  However, we can also insert zeros and twos arbitrarily in the ones? Actually, no: the zeros must appear in the original order, and the twos must appear in the original order.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  We know that we can independently arrange the zeros and the ones arbitrarily (so we can put all zeros first, then all ones) and independently arrange the ones and the twos arbitrarily (so we can put all ones first, then all twos). But we cannot break the zeros and twos relative order.\n\n  But note: the zeros and ones can be arranged arbitrarily, and the ones and twos arbitrarily, so the zeros and twos can be arranged arbitrarily via the ones? Actually, no: the zeros and twos cannot be swapped directly, but we can use the ones to help. However, we just concluded that the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved.\n\n  Therefore, the entire process is constrained by:\n\n      The zeros must appear in the original order (from left to right, the zeros that appeared first must be first in the final string).\n      The twos must appear in the original order.\n\n  And the ones can be placed arbitrarily.\n\n  Now, how to interleave the zeros, ones, and twos?\n\n  We want the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n  Lexicographical order: '0' is smallest, then '1', then '2'.\n\n  We want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning. But we cannot break the relative order of zeros and twos. However, note that if we put a zero, then we cannot put a two that originally appeared before that zero? Actually, no: the two that originally appeared before the zero must appear before the zero in the final string? Wait, no: the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed. So if a zero appears and then a two in the original string, then in the final string the zero must appear before the two. Similarly, if a two appears and then a zero, the two must appear before the zero.\n\n  Therefore, we can break the string into two parts: the zeros and the non-zeros (non-zeros being ones and twos). But note: the non-zeros must have the property that the zeros and twos within the non-zeros part must be in the original relative order.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      We know that the zeros and twos must appear in the same order as in the original string. So we can form a list of the zeros and twos, preserving their order, and then insert the ones arbitrarily.\n\n  However, we can also consider: we are allowed to arrange the ones arbitrarily with respect to zeros and twos, so we can put all the ones at the beginning, then zeros, then twos? But wait, that might break the relative order of zeros and twos? \n\n  Example: Original string: \"102\"\n\n  According to the above: the relative order of zeros and twos must be maintained. In \"102\", we have a zero and a two. The zero comes before the two, so in the final string the zero must come before the two. Also, the one can be placed arbitrarily. \n\n  What is the lexicographically smallest string we can get?\n\n      Possibilities: \n        Option1: \"012\" -> but wait, we cannot swap the 0 and 1 because that operation is allowed and then the 1 and 2? Actually, we can do:\n\n          \"102\" -> swap the first two (1 and 0) -> \"012\", then we cannot swap the 1 and 2 because they are adjacent and we can swap 1 and 2 -> \"021\".\n\n        But wait, is \"012\" lexicographically smaller than \"021\"? \n          Compare: \n            \"012\": first character '0'\n            \"021\": first character '0'\n            Then second: '1' vs '2' -> so \"012\" is smaller.\n\n        How did we get \"012\"? We swapped the first two (allowed) and then we cannot do anything else because we don't want to swap the middle and last? Actually, we can also stop at \"012\". \n\n        But note: we can also swap the middle and last: \"012\" -> swap the '1' and '2' (adjacent and of type 1 and 2) to get \"021\", which is larger.\n\n        So we don't have to do that swap.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal string is \"012\".\n\n        However, note: the original string was \"102\". The relative order of zeros and twos: the zero was originally at index1 and the two at index2, so the zero must come before the two. In \"012\", the zero is at index0 and the two at index2 -> that's okay. \n\n        But wait, is it allowed to have a zero at the beginning? In the original string, the one was at the beginning. We moved the zero to the front by swapping the 1 and 0. Then we left the ones and twos as they were.\n\n        Now, consider: we are allowed to move zeros arbitrarily to the left (by swapping with ones). Similarly, we can move ones arbitrarily to the right (by swapping with zeros and with twos). And we can move twos arbitrarily to the right (by swapping with ones).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal lexicographical string is obtained by:\n\n          - Putting all zeros at the beginning (if we can, by moving them left through ones) but we must not break the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n        However, note: we cannot move a zero to the left of a two that originally was to the left of it? Actually, the two that originally was to the left of the zero must stay to the left of the zero. But if we move the zero to the very front, then we are putting the zero before any two that originally was to the left of it, which is allowed because the two that was originally to the left of the zero must be moved to the right? \n\n        Let me reexamine: the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as in the original. That means:\n\n          If in the original string we had a two then a zero (like \"20\"), then in the final string the two must come before the zero.\n\n          But if we have a zero then a two (like \"02\"), then the zero must come before the two.\n\n        So in \"102\", the zero is originally after the one and before the two. We can move the zero to the front (since there's a one to its left, we can swap the one and zero) and that does not break the condition because the two is still after the zero.\n\n        Similarly, if we have \"210\", then the two is first, then one, then zero. The relative order of zeros and twos: the zero is after the two. So in the final string, the two must be before the zero. We can move the one and zero arbitrarily, but we cannot put the zero before the two.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          We want to produce a string that is the lexicographically smallest, and satisfies:\n\n            The zeros must appear in the original order (so the i-th zero in the original string must appear before the j-th zero for i<j)\n            The twos must appear in the original order.\n\n          And the ones can be placed arbitrarily.\n\n        How to construct?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let A = list of zeros (with their original indices, but we don't care about the indices beyond the order) and B = list of twos (same).\n\n          Then, we can consider that the zeros and twos must appear in the order of increasing index (i.e., the order they appear in the original string). \n\n          But note: the original string might have zeros and twos interleaved with ones.\n\n          We can think of the entire string as having three types. We are going to output a string that is the lexicographically smallest, and we know:\n\n            We can put zeros at the beginning, then ones, then twos, but wait: what if we have a two that originally was before a zero? Then we cannot put the zero before the two.\n\n          Actually, we must merge the zeros and twos (in their original order) and then insert the ones arbitrarily. But the ones can be inserted arbitrarily, so we can put all the ones at the beginning? \n\n          However, consider: we want the lexicographically smallest. The smallest character is '0'. Then '1', then '2'. \n\n          We want to output as many zeros as possible at the beginning. But we cannot output a zero that originally appeared after a two? Because then the two that originally appeared before the zero would have to appear after the zero, which is not allowed.\n\n          Actually, we cannot break the relative order of zeros and twos. So the zeros and twos must appear in the same order as in the original string. \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            We will traverse the original string and whenever we see a zero, we output it (because zeros are the smallest). But wait, we can also delay outputting zeros? \n\n          Another idea:\n\n            We can use a two-pointer or a state machine for zeros and twos, and then insert the ones arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We are allowed to rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily (so we can put all zeros first and then ones) and the ones and twos arbitrarily (so we can put all ones first and then twos). But the zeros and twos must be in the original relative order.\n\n          However, note: we can also mix zeros and twos arbitrarily as long as the relative order is preserved, but the goal is lexicographical minimum.\n\n          The lexicographical minimum is achieved by:\n\n            First, output as many zeros as possible (without breaking the condition). Then as many ones as possible, then twos.\n\n          But wait, we cannot break the condition: the zeros must be in the original order and the twos must be in the original order.\n\n          How about:\n\n            We split the string into zeros and non-zeros (non-zeros are ones and twos). Then, we can independently arrange the non-zeros? But the non-zeros must preserve the relative order of the zeros and the twos.\n\n          Actually, we can consider: \n\n            The entire set of characters is divided into three independent chains (zeros, ones, twos) but the zeros and twos chains are linked by the condition that their relative order must be the same as in the original.\n\n          This problem is similar to merging three sorted lists, but with the constraint that the zeros and twos must be merged in a fixed relative order.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let Z = list of indices (or just the characters) of zeros in order.\n            Let O = list of indices of ones in order.\n            Let T = list of indices of twos in order.\n\n          We want to merge these three lists with the following:\n\n            The zeros must appear in the order of Z.\n            The twos must appear in the order of T.\n            The ones can appear arbitrarily.\n\n          But the condition is that the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as in the original. This condition is automatically satisfied if we take the zeros and twos from the original string in the order they appear and then interleave with ones arbitrarily.\n\n          However, note: the original string has zeros, ones, and twos. The relative order of zeros and twos is defined by the original string: meaning, if a zero appears before a two in the original, then in the merged string the zero must appear before the two. Similarly, if a two appears before a zero, then the two must appear before the zero.\n\n          So we must merge Z and T such that the order of Z and T is the same as in the original string. Then, we can insert the ones arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: the original string gives the order of zeros and twos. So we can create an array that is the original string and then extract the zeros and twos in order, and then we know the relative positions of zeros and twos.\n\n          Actually, we can simply:\n\n            Create an array that will hold the final string.\n\n            We are going to use two pointers for zeros and twos, and then we'll insert the ones arbitrarily. But we want the lexicographically smallest.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            Since we can put zeros and ones arbitrarily (without breaking the condition for zeros and twos), we can put all zeros at the beginning and then all ones and then all twos? \n\n          However, that might break the condition for zeros and twos if the original string has a two that appeared before a zero. For example, if the original string is \"20\", then we cannot put the zero before the two. So we cannot put all zeros at the beginning.\n\n          Therefore, we must merge the zeros and twos according to their original relative order, and then insert the ones arbitrarily.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let i = 0 for zeros, j = 0 for twos, k = 0 for ones.\n\n            But we don't know the relative order of zeros and twos. We can precompute:\n\n                Let X = the sequence of zeros and twos in the original string, preserving the order, and mark which is zero and which is two.\n\n            Then, we can merge the zeros and twos (which are already in the correct relative order) and then insert the ones arbitrarily.\n\n          However, we want the lexicographically smallest string. We can choose to output a one only when we have no zeros or twos that are forced to be output.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We are going to output the string by processing the original string's zeros and twos in the correct relative order, but we can insert ones at any point.\n\n          But note: the ones can be placed arbitrarily, so we can put all ones at the beginning? \n\n          Example: \"102\"\n\n            Original: ['1','0','2']\n            Zeros: ['0'] (at index1)\n            Twos: ['2'] (at index2)\n            Ones: ['1'] (at index0)\n\n            Condition: the zero must be before the two.\n\n            Possibilities:\n\n              We can output the one first, then the zero, then the two: \"102\" -> but wait, we can also output the zero first? \n\n            How to output the zero first? We can swap the one and the zero (adjacent swap of '1' and '0') to get \"012\". Then we cannot swap the one and the two? Actually, we can swap the one and two (if they become adjacent) but that would give \"021\", which is larger.\n\n            So the minimal is \"012\".\n\n            But note: we are allowed to move the one to the right? Actually, we can also move the one to the right by swapping with the two? \n\n            Steps for \"102\":\n\n              Original: \"102\"\n              Swap the first two (0 and 1): \"012\" -> now we have a zero at the front.\n\n            So we can put the zero at the front, then the one, then the two.\n\n            Now, consider \"201\":\n\n              Original: \"201\"\n              Zeros: ['0'] (index1)\n              Twos: ['2'] (index0)\n              Ones: ['1'] (index2)\n\n              Condition: the two must be before the zero.\n\n              We cannot put the zero before the two.\n\n              What is the minimal?\n\n              Possibilities:\n\n                We can swap the two and the one? (adjacent swap for 2 and 1) -> \"210\"\n                Then swap the one and the zero? (adjacent swap for 1 and 0) -> \"201\" -> but wait, we cannot swap 1 and 0? Actually, we can swap 1 and 0, so from \"210\" we can swap the last two: \"201\" -> same.\n\n                But from \"201\", we can also swap the first two (2 and 0) -> not allowed.\n\n                So we cannot move the zero to the front.\n\n                The only moves we can do:\n\n                  Swap the two and the one (if they are adjacent) -> \"201\" becomes \"210\" (if we swap the two and the one? Actually, the two is at index0 and the one at index2, so they are not adjacent. So we cannot swap them directly.\n\n                Actually, the two and the one are not adjacent. So we cannot swap them. Therefore, the string \"201\" is fixed.\n\n                But wait, we can swap the zero and the one? They are adjacent: \"201\": the zero and the one are adjacent? Actually, no: the string is \"201\", so adjacent pairs are (2,0) and (0,1). The pair (0,1) is allowed (swap 0 and 1) -> so we can swap the zero and the one: \"210\". Then we can swap the two and the one? Now the two and the one are adjacent: \"210\" -> swap the two and the one (adjacent 2 and 1) -> \"120\".\n\n                Then from \"120\", we can swap the one and the zero? (adjacent 1 and 0) -> \"102\", but wait, we already saw that \"102\" can be rearranged to \"012\", so that is even better? \n\n                But note: we are allowed to do any number of moves. So from \"201\", we can:\n\n                  Step1: swap the zero and the one -> \"210\"\n                  Step2: swap the two and the one -> \"120\"\n                  Step3: swap the one and the zero -> \"102\"\n                  Step4: swap the one and the zero again? -> \"012\"\n\n                So we can get \"012\".\n\n                However, wait: the condition says the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. In the original string \"201\", the two comes first and then the zero. In \"012\", the zero is first and then the two, which reverses the relative order.\n\n                This is a contradiction.\n\n          Let me check the problem statement: the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. \n\n          In the original string \"201\", the two is at index0 and the zero at index1. The two comes before the zero. In the final string \"012\", the zero is at index0 and the two at index2: the zero is before the two. This breaks the condition.\n\n          But wait, how did we get from \"201\" to \"012\"? \n\n          Steps:\n\n            \"201\" -> swap the '0' and '1' (because they are adjacent and 0 and 1): becomes \"210\"\n            \"210\" -> swap the '2' and '1' (because they are adjacent and 1 and 2): becomes \"120\"\n            \"120\" -> swap the '1' and '0' (because they are adjacent and 1 and 0): becomes \"102\"\n            \"102\" -> swap the '0' and '1' (because they are adjacent and 0 and 1): becomes \"012\"\n\n          But wait, the condition says: we cannot swap 0 and 2. However, in \"102\", we swapped the '0' and '1' (allowed) and then the '1' and '2' (allowed). \n\n          However, the problem states: we can swap adjacent '0' and '1' OR '1' and '2'. We never swapped a '0' and '2' directly.\n\n          But the condition about the relative order of zeros and twos: \n\n            In the original string \"201\", the two is at index0 and the zero at index1. In the final string \"012\", the zero is at index0 and the two at index2. \n\n          The condition: the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as in the original string. \n\n          What does that mean? It means that if a zero originally was after a two, then in the final string the zero must be after the two. In \"012\", the zero is before the two, which is the opposite of the original.\n\n          So why is \"012\" allowed? \n\n          Let me re-read the problem: \"You can swap any two adjacent (consecutive) characters '0' and '1' (i.e. replace \"01\" with \"10\" or vice versa) or any two adjacent (consecutive) characters '1' and '2' (i.e. replace \"12\" with \"21\" or vice versa).\"\n\n          And the example: \"010210\" -> \"001210\", etc.\n\n          The key: the problem does not say that the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. It says we cannot swap 0 and 2. \n\n          But note: the example operations do not include swapping 0 and 2. \n\n          However, the problem says: you can use these swaps arbitrary number of times. \n\n          Does that imply that we can achieve any permutation that respects the following?\n\n          Actually, we can use the ones as intermediaries to move zeros and twos past each other, but the catch is: the relative order of zeros and twos cannot change because to move a zero past a two, we must use a one, and the sequence of swaps might be:\n\n            ... a zero, then a one, then a two ...\n\n            We can swap the zero and one: so the one moves right and the zero moves left.\n            Then swap the one and two: so the two moves left and the one moves right.\n\n            Net effect: the zero and two have swapped places, and the one is back in the middle.\n\n          But wait, that is exactly what happened in the example above: \n\n            \"012\" -> swap0-1 -> \"102\", then swap1-2 -> \"012\" again? That didn't move the zero and two.\n\n          Let me try with \"012\" and see if I can get \"201\":\n\n            \"012\" -> swap0-1 -> \"102\"\n            \"102\" -> swap1-2 -> \"120\"\n            \"120\" -> swap0-1 -> \"102\" -> cycle.\n\n          But wait, from \"102\", can I swap the 0 and 2? No. \n\n          Now, what if I have two ones? \n\n          Example: \"0112\"\n\n          Original: \"0112\"\n\n          We want to move the two to the front? \n\n          Steps:\n\n            \"0112\": \n              We can swap the last two (1 and 2): \"0121\"\n              Then swap the third and fourth (2 and 1): \"0112\" -> no change.\n\n          Alternatively:\n\n            \"0112\": \n              We can move the two to the left by swapping with ones.\n\n            Swap the two and the last one: \"0121\"\n            Then swap the two and the next one: \"0211\"\n            Then swap the two and the zero? -> not allowed.\n\n          So we cannot get a two before a zero if there's a zero originally before the two? \n\n          Actually, the problem allows swapping 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. This means we can model the string as a graph where:\n\n            Each '0' can be connected to each '1' (adjacent or not? no, only adjacent swaps) and each '1' to each '2'.\n\n          But note: the swaps are adjacent. So we can only swap adjacent elements.\n\n          However, by repeated swaps, we can move a '0' arbitrarily to the left by swapping with ones, and a '2' arbitrarily to the right by swapping with ones. \n\n          But can we move a '0' to the right? Only if there is a '1' to its right? Actually, no: we can move a '0' to the right by swapping with a '1' that is to its left? No, because we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, and to move a 0 to the right, we would need to swap it with a '1' to its right, but then the '1' moves to the left. \n\n          Actually, the movement of a zero is only to the left (because we swap 0 and 1: the 0 moves left and the 1 moves right). Similarly, a two can only move to the right (swap with a 1 to its left: then the two moves right and the 1 moves left). \n\n          But wait, swapping 0 and 1: \n            \"a0b1c\" -> if we swap the 0 and 1, we get \"a1b0c\". So the zero moved one to the right and the one moved one to the left.\n\n          Similarly, swapping 1 and 2: \n            \"a1b2c\" -> \"a2b1c\": the two moved one to the left and the one moved one to the right.\n\n          So zeros can move right by swapping with ones to their right, and twos can move left by swapping with ones to their left.\n\n          And ones can move left by swapping with zeros or twos, and move right by swapping with zeros or twos.\n\n          Therefore, the movement is not limited to left for zeros and right for twos. \n\n          This changes everything.\n\n          Now, the relative order of zeros and twos can be changed by moving them through ones.\n\n          Example \"201\": \n\n            We can move the zero",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on '0's and '1's or '1's and '2's. The key observation here is that while '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, they can be moved past each other through intermediate '1's. This allows us to rearrange the string such that all '0's come first, followed by '1's, and then '2's, provided that the relative order of '0's and '2's remains unchanged as per their original positions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming a ternary string into its lexicographically smallest form using only adjacent swaps between '0' and '1' or between '1' and '2'. The challenge is to ensure that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the final string matches their original order, while leveraging '1's to facilitate the movement of '0's and '2's past each other.\n2. **Insight**: The lexicographically smallest string will have all '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string. This means that any '0' originally appearing before a '2' must stay before it in the result, and vice versa.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Separating the original string into three lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's.\n   - Merging these lists while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's and inserting '1's wherever they appear in the original string.\n   - The merged string is constructed by interleaving '0's and '2's in their original order and placing '1's wherever they occurred in the original string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    merged_zeros_twos = []\n    i_z = 0\n    i_t = 0\n    n_z = len(zeros)\n    n_t = len(twos)\n    \n    while i_z < n_z and i_t < n_t:\n        if zeros[i_z] < twos[i_t]:\n            merged_zeros_twos.append(zeros[i_z])\n            i_z += 1\n        else:\n            merged_zeros_twos.append(twos[i_t])\n            i_t += 1\n            \n    while i_z < n_z:\n        merged_zeros_twos.append(zeros[i_z])\n        i_z += 1\n        \n    while i_t < n_t:\n        merged_zeros_twos.append(twos[i_t])\n        i_t += 1\n        \n    result = []\n    i_o = 0\n    for part in merged_zeros_twos:\n        result.append(part)\n        if i_o < len(ones):\n            result.append(ones[i_o])\n            i_o += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and processed to separate '0's, '1's, and '2's into three distinct lists.\n2. **Merging '0's and '2's**: The '0's and '2's are merged while preserving their original relative order. This is done by comparing elements from both lists and appending the smaller one (based on character value) to the result list. If one list is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are appended.\n3. **Inserting '1's**: After merging '0's and '2's, '1's are inserted at their original positions in the merged list. This ensures that '1's appear in their original order but are interleaved appropriately with '0's and '2's.\n4. **Output**: The final merged and interleaved string is printed, which is the lexicographically smallest possible string under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps to position '0's and '2's correctly while integrating '1's seamlessly, resulting in the desired lexicographically smallest string.",
