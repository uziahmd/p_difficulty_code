He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one string which is either an integer or 'R' (for Roman). But note: the second part may be an integer OR the letter 'R'. However, the input format says: the first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25) but then says \"Only b may be replaced by an R\". So actually, the first token is always an integer a (base), and the second token can be either an integer b (the base) or the letter 'R' (meaning we output in Roman numerals).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split it into two parts.\n 2. The first part is the base `a` (integer). The second part is either an integer `b` or the string 'R'.\n\n 3. Then read the next line which is the number `c` in base `a`. The representation of `c` might have leading zeros, but the length is at most 1000.\n\n 4. We need to convert `c` from base `a` to base `b` (if `b` is given as an integer) or to Roman numerals (if `b` is 'R').\n\n However, note the guarantee: \n   - If we have Roman numerals, the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n   - In any other case (i.e., when `b` is an integer base) the number (after converting from base `a`) won't be greater than 10^1510? Actually, note: the input number in base `a` has length at most 1000, so we cannot convert to base 10 by direct conversion if the base is large and the number is huge (because the number might be astronomically large). Therefore, we must use a smarter way.\n\n But note: the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is <= 300010, so we can convert to base 10 (or even directly to Roman) only for those cases. However, the input number is given in base `a` (which can be up to 25) and the string length is up to 1000. The value of the number in base `a` can be huge (like base 25 with 1000 digits) which is too big for standard integers.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the base `a` is at most 25, we can convert the given string (which is in base `a`) to a number in base 10 (using int(c, base=a)) but wait: the base `a` can be up to 25 and the string can have digits beyond 9. The problem says the number may contain leading zeros, but the base `a` is between 2 and 25.\n\n However, note: the input number `c` is non-negative and the base `a` is at least 2. The representation in base `a` uses digits from '0' to the digit representing `a-1`. But the problem also says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n But wait: the input is given as a string. How are the digits represented? The example: \n   Input: '12 13\\nA' -> base 12, so A represents 10.\n\n However, the problem states: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\"\n\n So we have to parse the string. The digits in base `a` can be:\n   - Digits from '0' to '9' and then from 'A' to the letter representing (a-1). But note: if a<=10, then digits are from '0' to str(a-1). If a>10, then we use digits 0-9 and then letters starting from 'A' (for 10) up to the (a-1)th digit.\n\n But note: the example input: '2 2\\n1111001' -> base2, and the number is 1111001 (binary). Also, '16 R\\n5' -> base16, and the number is 5 (which is just '5').\n\n However, there's a catch: the input number is given in base `a`, so we can convert it to base 10 (as an integer) only if the base `a` is small enough and the number isn't too long. But the length is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another or to Roman numerals. The solution involves handling two main cases: converting between two integer bases and converting from an integer base to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Input Handling**: The first line of input contains two values: the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which can be either an integer or 'R' (for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n   - **Conversion to Base 10**: The number `c` in base `a` is first converted to a base 10 integer. This is done by processing each digit of the string representation of `c`, where digits beyond '9' are represented by letters (e.g., 'A' for 10).\n   - **Roman Numerals Conversion**: If the target base `b` is 'R', the base 10 integer is converted to Roman numerals following specific rules (e.g., using subtractive notation for numbers like 4 (IV) and 9 (IX)).\n   - **Base Conversion**: If the target base `b` is an integer, the base 10 integer is converted to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. Special cases include handling base 1 (though the problem constraints ensure `b` is at least 2) and ensuring no leading zeros in the output.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Base Conversion**: For converting between integer bases, standard algorithms are used: repeated division for target bases and direct parsing for base 10 conversion.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: A mapping from integers to Roman numeral symbols is used, with special handling for subtractive combinations (e.g., 4 as IV, 9 as IX).\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The conversion from base `a` to base 10 is linear in the length of the input string. The conversion to Roman numerals or another base is also linear relative to the magnitude of the number, but since the input size is limited (up to 1000 digits), it remains efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a_str = data[0]\n    b_str = data[1] if len(data) > 1 else 'R'\n    \n    num_str = input().strip()\n    \n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    base_b = b_str\n    \n    def convert_to_base_10(s, base):\n        value = 0\n        length = len(s)\n        for i, char in enumerate(s):\n            if char.isdigit():\n                digit_val = int(char)\n            else:\n                digit_val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n            if digit_val >= base:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid digit for base\")\n                \n            power = length - i - 1\n            value += digit_val * (base ** power)\n        return value\n\n    try:\n        num = convert_to_base_10(num_str, base_a)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n        return\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        def to_roman(n):\n            val = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]\n            sy = [\"M\", \"CM\", \"D\", \"CD\", \"L\", \"XL\", \"X\", \"IX\", \"V\", \"IV\", \"I\"]\n            roman_num = ''\n            for i in range(len(val)):\n                count = n // val[i]\n                if count:\n                    roman_num += sy[i] * count\n                    n -= val[i] * count\n            return roman_num\n        \n        print(to_roman(num))\n    else:\n        base_b_int = int(base_b)\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, base_b_int)\n                digits.append(str(r) if r < 10 else chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n            result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The program reads the source base `a`, target base `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n- **Base Conversion**: The number `c` is converted from base `a` to base 10 by processing each digit, accounting for letters (A-Z) representing values 10 and above.\n- **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to symbols, handling subtractive combinations appropriately.\n- **Integer Base Conversion**: For other target bases, the base 10 number is converted by repeated division, with remainders collected and mapped to digits (including letters for values 10 and above). The result is reversed to form the correct sequence of digits.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified cases, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
