Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees on n vertices.\n\n Conditions for a good tree:\n  - Each edge weight is either 1 or -1.\n  - For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights on the path from i to (say) the root (or more precisely, for each vertex i, the product along the edges incident to i? Actually, note: the condition says \"for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint\" â€” but wait, a vertex can have multiple edges. However, in a tree, the condition might be interpreted differently.\n\nBut note: the problem states: \"for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint\" is -1.\n\nHowever, consider: an edge has two endpoints. So for vertex i, we take all edges incident to i and multiply their weights. Then that product must be -1.\n\nBut note: in a tree, the entire graph is connected and acyclic. Also, the product condition is defined for every vertex.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nIn the example: n=2. The only tree has one edge between 1 and 2. Then for vertex 1: the product is the weight of that edge; for vertex 2: the same weight. So condition requires that the weight must be -1 (because (-1)*(-1) is not the condition? Wait, no: for vertex 1, the product is just the weight of the edge (since there's one edge). Similarly for vertex 2. Then the condition requires both the product for vertex 1 and for vertex 2 to be -1. So the edge must be -1. Then d(1,2) = -1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint\" for each vertex i. So for n=2, there are two conditions: at vertex 1, the product is the edge weight (say w), and at vertex 2, the product is the same edge weight w. Then we require w = -1 and w = -1. So indeed the edge must be -1.\n\nHowever, consider n=3. Let the tree be with edges (1-2) and (2-3). Then:\n  For vertex 1: product = w1 (edge 1-2)\n  For vertex 2: product = w1 * w2 (edges 1-2 and 2-3)\n  For vertex 3: product = w2\n\nConditions: \n  w1 = -1\n  w1 * w2 = -1  => (-1)*w2 = -1 => w2 = 1\n  w2 = 1 -> which is consistent.\n\nBut wait, the condition for vertex 3 is w2 = 1, which is okay. And for vertex 1: w1=-1, for vertex 2: (-1)*1 = -1. So that works.\n\nBut note: the condition for vertex 3 is the product of edges having 3 as an endpoint, which is only the edge (2-3). So yes, we get w2 must be -1? But wait, we just said w2 must be 1 from the condition at vertex 2. Contradiction.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition: \"for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint\". \n\nFor vertex 3: the edges having 3 as an endpoint are only the edge (2-3). So the product is w2. Condition requires w2 = -1.\n\nBut then from vertex 2: w1 * w2 = -1, so if w2=-1 then w1 must be 1. Then condition for vertex 1: w1=1, but we require w1=-1. So that fails.\n\nAlternatively, what if we have two edges: one from 1-2 with weight 1 and one from 2-3 with weight -1?\nThen:\n  Vertex 1: product = 1 -> should be -1 -> fails.\n\nSo how can we satisfy for n=3?\n\nWe must have:\n  For vertex 1: w1 = -1.\n  For vertex 2: w1 * w2 = -1.\n  For vertex 3: w2 = -1.\n\nBut then from vertex 1: w1 = -1, from vertex 3: w2 = -1, then from vertex 2: (-1)*(-1)=1, which is not -1. Contradiction.\n\nWait, let me try a different labeling: perhaps the condition is applied to the entire path from the vertex to a fixed root? But the problem does not specify a root.\n\nAlternatively, note: the problem says \"each edge is either 1 or -1\", and the condition is for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1.\n\nBut then, for n=3, there is no solution? However, the example input includes n=2, and the example output for n=2 is 998244352 (which is -1 mod 998244353). Then for n=3, what is the answer? The example input doesn't include n=3, but the example input includes n=1,2,4,10,43434.\n\nWait, the example input format is: \n  ['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\nBut the example output is:\n  ['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\nSo the first test case is n=2, the second is n=1, the third is n=4, then n=10, then n=43434.\n\nNow, for n=1: \n  There are no edges. Then the product condition for the single vertex: there are no edges, so the product is 1 (by definition of empty product). But the condition requires the product to be -1. Therefore, no good tree exists for n=1? Then the answer should be 0.\n\nBut the example input n=1 is provided and the output is 0.\n\nSo for n=1: 0.\n\nFor n=2: we have one edge, and the condition requires the edge weight to be -1 (since both vertices would see the same edge). Then d(1,2) = -1, which modulo 998244353 is 998244352.\n\nFor n=3: we saw that the conditions are contradictory? But wait, the example input does not have n=3, so maybe we don't need to worry about n=3? However, the problem says n>=1 and up to 500000.\n\nBut wait, there's an example for n=4. Let's analyze n=4.\n\nThe example says: \n  There are 16 distinct good trees. The value of d(1,4) is:\n    -2 for 2 trees\n    -1 for 8 trees\n    0 for 4 trees\n    1 for 2 trees\n\nTotal sum = 2*(-2) + 8*(-1) + 4*0 + 2*1 = -4 -8 + 2 = -10.\n\nBut note: the total number of good trees for n=4 is 16.\n\nHow do we count the good trees?\n\nCondition: For each vertex i, the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\nThis is a system of equations. Since the graph is a tree, the degrees of the vertices are determined by the structure (a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges). \n\nBut note: the product condition is multiplicative. We can think of this as: we assign a sign (1 or -1) to each edge. Then for each vertex i, the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\nThis is equivalent to: for each vertex i, the number of edges incident to i with weight -1 must be odd.\n\nBut note: the entire graph must be a tree. Moreover, the signs must satisfy the system of linear equations (over GF(2)): for each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the edges incident to it (if we map 1->0 and -1->1) must be 1 (since odd number of -1).\n\nHowever, note: the system of equations has n equations (one per vertex) and n-1 variables (edges). In general, the system may be over-constrained, but note that the product of the equations (if we consider the multiplicative system) must satisfy consistency.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the product of all vertex conditions is the square of the product of all edges (each edge appears exactly twice, once for each endpoint). So the product of the vertex conditions is (product_{edges} w(e))^2. But we require each vertex condition to be -1, so the product of all vertex conditions is (-1)^n.\n\nOn the other hand, the product of all vertex conditions is (product_{e} w(e))^2. Therefore, we must have (product_{e} w(e))^2 â‰¡ (-1)^n (mod ?) but actually, since we are in integers, we have an equation in the integers. However, note: the product of the vertex conditions is (product_{e} w(e))^{2} because each edge appears in two vertices.\n\nBut also, the system of equations (in GF2) for the signs is:\n\n  Let x_i (for i-th edge) be 0 or 1 (where 1 means -1, 0 means 1). Then for each vertex i, the sum (mod2) of the x_j for edges j incident to i is 1.\n\nThis is a linear system over GF(2). The number of solutions is 2^{k} where k is the dimension of the solution space. The system has n equations and n-1 variables. The sum of all equations: each edge appears in two equations. So the sum of all equations is 0 (mod2). Therefore, the system has rank n-1 if the graph is connected? Actually, the graph is a tree (connected with n-1 edges). The incidence matrix of a tree has rank n-1 (over reals) but over GF(2) the rank is also n-1? \n\nActually, the system of equations for the tree is consistent if and only if the all-ones vector is in the column space? But note: the condition for the system is that the sum of the equations is 0 (each edge counted twice, so 0 mod2). The right-hand side is a vector of ones. The sum of the equations is the sum of all ones, which is n (mod2). Therefore, the system is consistent only if n is even? Because the sum of the equations must be 0 (mod2) and the left-hand side (the incidence matrix times any vector) will always be 0 for the sum (since each edge appears twice). But the right-hand side is a vector of ones, so the sum of the right-hand side is n. Then the system is consistent only if n is even?\n\nWait, for n=2: the system has two equations and one variable. Equation for vertex1: x = 1, equation for vertex2: x = 1. Then the system is consistent: x=1. Then the condition is that the edge is -1. So n=2 (even) is consistent.\n\nFor n=3: three equations and two variables. The equations are:\n  x1 = 1 (from vertex1)\n  x1 + x2 = 1 (from vertex2)\n  x2 = 1 (from vertex3)\n\nThen from vertex1: x1=1, then vertex2: 1+x2=1 => x2=0, then vertex3: x2=1 -> contradiction. So n=3 is inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the system of equations (in GF2) has a solution only if n is even? \n\nBut wait, the example n=4 (even) is consistent and the example n=1 (odd) has no solution, n=2 (even) has solution, n=3 (odd) no solution.\n\nTherefore, we can only form good trees if n is even. Otherwise, there are 0.\n\nBut the example input includes n=4 (even) and n=10 (even) and n=2 (even). And n=1 and n=43434 (even) but wait, 43434 is even.\n\nWait, 43434 is even, but 1 is odd. Then for odd n>=3, there are no good trees? \n\nBut wait, what about n=1? n=1: no edges. Then the product for the single vertex is the empty product, which is 1. Condition requires 1 = -1 -> false. So no solution.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: no solution.\n\nBut note: the example input has n=1,2,4,10,43434. So n=1 is odd and we output 0, n=2 even, n=4 even, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n  If n is odd, then the answer is 0 (unless n=1, but n=1 is odd and we already know 0).\n  If n is even, then we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nBut wait, the example n=4: we have 16 good trees. How many good trees are there for n even?\n\nTotal number of trees on n labeled vertices is n^(n-2) (Cayley's formula). Then, for a fixed tree, the system of equations (over GF2) for the signs (each edge is either 1 or -1) has a solution space of dimension 0 (if n is odd, no solution) or 1 (if n is even)? Actually, the system has n equations and n-1 variables, and the solution space (if consistent) has dimension 1? Because the homogeneous system (all ones on the RHS) has the same nullity? \n\nActually, the system is consistent when n is even. Then the solution space is an affine space of dimension 1? Or is it a coset of a linear space of dimension 1? \n\nWait, the system has n equations and n-1 variables. The rank of the system is n-1 (because the graph is connected and the system is the incidence matrix). Then the solution space has dimension (number of variables) - (rank) = (n-1) - (n-1) = 0? Then there is exactly one solution.\n\nBut wait, for n=2: one variable, one equation (actually two equations, but they are the same). The system is:\n  x = 1\n  x = 1\n\nThen there is one solution: x=1.\n\nBut for n=4: we have 3 variables (edges) and 4 equations. The system is consistent, and the rank is 3 (since the graph is connected). Then the solution space has dimension 3-3=0? Then there is exactly one solution per tree.\n\nBut the example says for n=4, there are 16 distinct good trees. However, note: the problem does not fix the tree structure. We are considering all trees (labeled) and then for each tree we assign the signs according to the system.\n\nBut wait, the system depends on the tree. Actually, the system is built from the tree: the edges are the variables, and the equations are for each vertex.\n\nBut note: the condition is on the entire tree. The system is defined for a fixed tree. Then for a fixed tree, if n is even, the system has a unique solution (so the signs are completely determined). Then the number of good trees is the number of trees (labeled) that are consistent with the system? Actually, no: the system is defined for a fixed tree and then we assign the signs (edge weights) according to the solution. But note: the problem counts distinct trees (with labeled vertices) and the edges are part of the tree. So the total number of good trees is the number of trees (n^(n-2)) multiplied by the number of sign assignments that satisfy the system (which is 1 if n is even, 0 if n is odd). But wait, that would give n^(n-2) for even n, and 0 for odd n.\n\nBut for n=2: number of trees is 2^(0)=1, and then 1 solution, so total 1 good tree. Matches.\n\nFor n=4: the number of trees is 4^2 = 16. Then the total number of good trees is 16. This matches the example: \"There are 16 distinct good trees\".\n\nSo the total number of good trees is:\n   if n is odd: 0\n   if n is even: n^(n-2)\n\nBut wait, the example n=4: 4^(2)=16, and n=2: 2^0=1.\n\nHowever, note: the problem states: \"There are n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}\" distinct edge-weighted trees. But that is without the product condition. Now, we are imposing the product condition (each vertex condition is -1). So the condition reduces the set.\n\nBut our reasoning above says that for a fixed tree (structure), the system of equations (over GF2) has a unique solution if n is even, and no solution if n is odd. Therefore, the total number of good trees is:\n   (number of trees) * (number of solutions per tree) = n^(n-2) * (1 if n even else 0)\n\nBut wait, the example n=4: 16 trees and 1 solution per tree -> 16 good trees.\n\nBut note: the example says: \"There are 16 distinct good trees\". So that matches.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"There are n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} distinct edge-weighted trees\", but then we are imposing an additional condition. So the good trees are a subset.\n\nNow, we must compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nNote: d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSince the edge weights are assigned by the system, and the system has a unique solution for even n, then for each tree (structure) there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights (if n is even). \n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  Answer = (if n is odd) 0, else (sum_{T: tree on n labeled vertices} [d(1,n) under the unique assignment])\n\nBut how to compute the sum over all trees?\n\nWe can use linearity of summation? But note: the assignment of edge weights depends on the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, we can use generating functions or known results about sums over trees.\n\nBut note: the condition is local (vertex conditions) and the assignment is unique. However, the value d(1,n) is the sum of the edges along the path from 1 to n.\n\nLet the tree T. Then the path from 1 to n is fixed (since the tree is labeled and the path is unique). Let the edges on the path be e1, e2, ..., e_k (k=n-1 for a chain, but in general the length is the distance). But note: the tree is arbitrary.\n\nWe can use the concept of PrÃ¼fer codes. There is a bijection between trees and sequences of length n-2 (each element from 1 to n). \n\nBut note: the condition on the product at each vertex imposes a relation on the edges. However, we have a unique assignment for the edges.\n\nBut observe: the product condition at each vertex i: the product of the edges incident to i is -1. This is independent of the tree structure? Actually, no: the system depends on the degree of the vertex and the connections.\n\nBut note: the assignment of signs is forced by the system. However, we can think of the following:\n\nEach edge is included in two equations. We can solve the system by assigning a potential to each vertex and then the edge weight being the ratio of the potentials? \n\nAlternatively, consider: we have a system of equations: for each vertex i, the product of the incident edges is -1. This is equivalent to: for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights around i is -1.\n\nBut note: the entire tree must satisfy the multiplicative consistency (the product of all vertex conditions is the square of the product of the edge weights). And we have shown that consistency requires n even.\n\nNow, we want to compute, for each edge, the probability (or the fraction) that it is +1 or -1, but then we have to account for the entire system.\n\nBut wait, the system is linear in GF2. We can assign to each edge a variable (0 or 1). Then the condition for vertex i is the sum (mod2) of the edges incident to i is 1.\n\nThen, the solution is unique (for even n). So we can express the value of each edge in terms of the others, but we have freedom to choose one variable arbitrarily? Actually, we can fix one edge arbitrarily and then solve the rest. But the uniqueness implies that the entire system is determined.\n\nBut note: the value of d(1,n) is the sum (in integers) of the edges on the path from 1 to n. But the edges are assigned Â±1. And the assignment is forced by the system.\n\nHowever, we cannot easily separate the contributions of the edges because the system couples all edges.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSince the assignment is unique for each tree, we can consider the contribution of each edge to d(1,n). But note: the edge only contributes to d(1,n) if it lies on the path from 1 to n. Otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nBut the condition on the edge being on the path from 1 to n depends on the tree structure.\n\nWe can use the linearity by edges:\n\nLet F(T) = d(1,n) for the tree T with the unique sign assignment.\n\nThen the total sum is: Sum_{T} F(T) = Sum_{T} [ sum_{e in path(1,n)} w_e ]\n\n= Sum_{e} [ number of trees T such that e is on the path from 1 to n ] * w_e (in the unique assignment)\n\nBut note: the sign of edge e is determined by the system (and depends on the entire tree T). Therefore, we cannot factor the edge independently.\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n  Answer = Sum_{T} [ (sum_{e in path(1,n) in T} w_e) ]\n\nBut note: the system of equations for the signs is defined by the entire tree T.\n\nAnother idea: use generating functions and the fact that the assignment is linear. Or use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut note: the condition on the entire tree is that the product at each vertex is -1. This is a global condition.\n\nWe can use the following: \n\n  Let A be the set of all trees (without sign conditions). Then the sum over T of d(1,n) for the arbitrary assignment (without conditions) is known? But then we have to restrict to the good trees.\n\nBut note: the good trees are those for which the system holds (n even) and then the assignment is forced.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the system is a linear system and the assignment is linear in the variables. Then the value d(1,n) is a linear combination of the edge variables (each edge variable is 0 or 1, and the edge weight is (-1)^(x_e)). But then the entire assignment is linear? \n\nWait, the edge weight is (-1)^(x_e) and the system is defined by the linear equations (mod2) in x_e. Then the value d(1,n) is the sum_{e in P} (-1)^(x_e) for the path P from 1 to n.\n\nBut note: the system gives values for x_e (0 or 1) for each edge. Then we can write:\n\n  d(1,n) = sum_{e in P} (-1)^(x_e)\n\nBut the x_e are determined by the system. However, the system is linear and we can express each x_e in terms of the others.\n\nBut note: the system is consistent and has full rank (n-1). Then the solution is unique. Therefore, the entire assignment is fixed by the system.\n\nNow, we can consider the entire set of trees and the system. But the system depends on the tree.\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n  S = Sum_{T} [ d(1,n)_T ]\n\nwhere T runs over all trees (labeled) on n vertices, and for each T we have the unique assignment of signs (edge weights) that satisfies the vertex conditions (if n is even, otherwise 0).\n\nBut note: the system of equations for T is:\n\n  For each vertex i, the sum (mod2) of the edges incident to i is 1.\n\nAnd the edges are the n-1 edges of T.\n\nNow, we can write:\n\n  Let M_T be the incidence matrix of T (over GF2). Then the solution is given by a vector x (in GF2^{n-1}) such that M_T * x = b, where b is the all-ones vector (mod2). Then the solution is unique (if the system is consistent) and we can express x as a function of T.\n\nBut note: the system is consistent if and only if n is even.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum over T of d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} (-1)^(x_e)?\n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nAnother idea: use the concept of electric networks. The condition is that the product of the edge weights (which are Â±1) around each vertex is -1. This is similar to Kirchhoff's current law in a circuit with unit currents? \n\nBut note: the product condition at a vertex is equivalent to: the net flow (if we think of the edge weights as conductances or something) ... \n\nWait, there is a known result: the assignment of Â±1 to edges such that the product at each vertex is -1 is equivalent to orienting the edges and then assigning +1 to forward edges and -1 to backward edges? \n\nBut note: the product condition at a vertex i is: the product of the incident edges is -1. This is equivalent to: the number of edges incident to i with weight -1 is odd.\n\nWe can think of this as: assign to each edge a direction, and then set the weight to be the sign of the direction (say, +1 for one direction and -1 for the opposite). But then the condition becomes: at each vertex, the net flow (counting outgoing edges as positive and incoming as negative) must be odd? \n\nBut wait, if we assign directions arbitrarily, then the product condition is automatically satisfied? Not exactly: the product condition is independent of the direction. However, note: if we assign directions, then the edge weight is the direction. Then the product condition is: the product of the directions (as Â±1) is -1. But if we assign directions arbitrarily, then the product condition is not automatically satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: \n\n  Consider a spanning tree and then use the fundamental cycle basis? \n\nBut note: we are working with a tree, so no cycles.\n\nWait, we can use the following: \n\n  The system of equations is linear and the solution is unique. Therefore, the assignment of the edge weights (Â±1) is determined by the system. We can assign a reference edge arbitrarily (say, set one edge to -1) and then the rest are determined. But the condition is global.\n\nBut note: the value of d(1,n) is the product (in a multiplicative sense) but then summed? Actually, d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path.\n\nHowever, the edge weights are determined by the system. \n\nLet me try to find a recurrence or generating function.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: n up to 500000. We need an efficient solution.\n\nWe can use generating functions and the PrÃ¼fer code.\n\nPrÃ¼fer code: a sequence of n-2 numbers from 1 to n. Each tree corresponds to a PrÃ¼fer code.\n\nBut the system depends on the tree structure. \n\nHowever, note: the system is defined by the adjacency of the tree. \n\nAnother idea: \n\n  We know that the system has a unique solution for even n. Then the assignment is completely determined by the tree. \n\n  We can express the solution in terms of the tree Laplacian or something.\n\nBut note: the system is:\n\n  Let A be the adjacency matrix (with edge variables) but we are in GF2. Actually, we can define a linear system using the incidence matrix.\n\n  Let M be the incidence matrix (each row is a vertex, each column is an edge). Then the condition is M*x = 1 (mod2).\n\n  Then x = M^{-1} * 1.\n\nBut M is the incidence matrix of a tree, which has rank n-1. Then M^{-1} is the Moore-Penrose inverse? But we are in GF2.\n\nNow, the edge e is represented by a column in M. Then the j-th component of M^{-1}*1 (for the j-th edge) is the value of x_j.\n\nBut how to compute the sum over all trees T of [sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} (-1)^{x_j}]?\n\nThis seems very abstract.\n\nAlternative approach: \n\n  We can use the fact that the system is linear and the assignment is linear in the choice of one free variable. But wait, the system is consistent and has full rank, so there is no free variable? Then the solution is uniquely determined by the system.\n\nBut note: the system has n equations and n-1 variables, so one equation is redundant. We can choose one edge arbitrarily? Actually, no: the system is consistent and the solution is unique.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the system has n equations and n-1 variables, and the graph is connected (so the incidence matrix has rank n-1). Then the system has a unique solution if the right-hand side is in the column space. And we know that the right-hand side is in the column space if and only if n is even.\n\nBut then, for even n, the solution is unique.\n\nNow, we can write the solution as:\n\n  x = M^{\\top} (M M^{\\top})^{-1} b   (this is the pseudo-inverse formula) but note: M is the incidence matrix (size n x (n-1)) and M M^{\\top} is the Laplacian matrix (with integer entries, not GF2). \n\nBut we are in GF2, so we need to work in GF2.\n\nBut note: the system is defined over GF2, so we can use the GF2 inverse.\n\nHowever, we need to compute the assignment for each tree. \n\nBut note: the total number of trees is n^(n-2) which is huge (n up to 500000). We cannot iterate over trees.\n\nWe need to use combinatorial identities.\n\nLet me reframe the problem:\n\n  We have a complete graph on n vertices. We consider all spanning trees. For each spanning tree, we have a system of equations (over GF2) that assigns to each edge a value (0 or 1) such that for each vertex, the sum of the incident edges (mod2) is 1.\n\n  Then the edge weight is (-1) raised to the assigned value.\n\n  And we want the sum over all spanning trees T of the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n.\n\nNow, we can use the following:\n\n  Let F(n) = Sum_{T} [ d(1,n)_T ]\n\n  = Sum_{T} [ sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} (-1)^{x_e} ]\n\n  = Sum_{e} [ Sum_{T: containing e and e is on the path from 1 to n in T} (-1)^{x_e} ]\n\nBut note: the edge e is fixed. The condition that e is on the path from 1 to n in T means that the unique path from 1 to n in T must use e. This happens if and only if the removal of e disconnects the tree into two components, one containing 1 and the other containing n.\n\nBut note: in a tree, the path from 1 to n is unique and uses e if and only if e lies on that path.\n\nNow, for a fixed edge e (connecting vertices u and v), the number of trees T that contain e and for which e is on the path from 1 to n is the number of trees that have e and in which 1 and n are in different connected components after removing e.\n\nThis is a standard result: the number of spanning trees that contain a particular edge e and for which the path from 1 to n goes through e is (number of spanning trees of the graph with edge e fixed) but actually, we can use the following:\n\n  Fix an edge e = (u, v). Then the spanning trees that contain e and have 1 and n in different sides of e are: \n\n      Let A be the set of vertices including 1 and excluding n, and B the set of vertices including n and excluding 1, such that u in A and v in B (or vice versa). Then the number of spanning trees that contain e and have the property is the product of the complete graphs on A and B (with the edge e connecting them) and then the number is (|A|^(|A|-1) * |B|^(|B|-1))? Actually, no: the standard Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem for complete graphs.\n\nActually, for a complete graph, the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge e is (n-2)^(n-2) (by Cayley's formula: fix an edge, then the remaining n-2 vertices form a tree with (n-2)^(n-3) trees, but then we have to connect the two parts? \n\nWait, the number of spanning trees containing a particular edge e is: \n  (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) ??? \n\nActually, no. The total number of spanning trees is n^(n-2). The number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge e: \n\n  We can contract the edge e, then the graph has n-1 vertices and the number of spanning trees is (n-1)^(n-3). Then by the multinomial coefficients, but actually, the standard result is: the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge is (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) / (n-1) ??? \n\nWait, there is a well-known result: the number of spanning trees of K_n that contain a particular edge is (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) / (n-1) ? \n\nActually, by the Matrix-Tree theorem, the number of spanning trees containing a particular edge e is: \n   (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1)   ??? \n\nBut wait, the total number is n^(n-2). The proportion of spanning trees containing a fixed edge is (n-2)^(n-2) / n^(n-2) * (number of edges) * something? \n\nStandard result: the number of spanning trees containing a particular edge e is (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) / (n-1) ? \n\nActually, we can think: to form a spanning tree containing e, we can first remove the edge e and then consider the two components (of sizes k and n-k). But then we have to connect these two components. Actually, the standard result is: \n\n  The number of spanning trees of K_n that contain a particular edge e is: \n      (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1)   [???]\n\nBut wait, I recall: the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge e is (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) / (n-1) is not right.\n\nActually, the number of spanning trees of K_n is n^(n-2). The number of spanning trees containing a particular edge e is: (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) ? \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) is larger than n^(n-2) for n>2.\n\nCorrect result: \n\n  The number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge e is (n-2)^(n-2) * (n-1) / (n-1) ??? \n\nWait, there is a better way: \n\n  Total spanning trees: n^(n-2)\n\n  The probability that a fixed edge is included in a random spanning tree is (n-1)/n^(n-2) * something? \n\nActually, by symmetry, the expected number of edges in a spanning tree is (n-1) (since there are n-1 edges). And there are n*(n-1)/2 edges, so the probability that a fixed edge is included is 2*(n-1)/n^(n-2) * (n-2)^(n-2) ? \n\nBut we know the total number of spanning trees is n^(n-2). The number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge e is: \n\n   (number of ways to choose a spanning tree on the graph K_n with edge e fixed) = (n-2)^(n-3) * (n-1) ? \n\nWait, no. Actually, after fixing an edge e, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances between vertices 1 and n (denoted as \\(d(1, n)\\)) over all good trees. A good tree is defined as an edge-weighted tree where each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Good Tree Conditions**: The tree must satisfy two conditions: each edge weight is either 1 or -1, and for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n   - **Key Insight**: For the product condition to hold for all vertices, the number of vertices \\(n\\) must be even. If \\(n\\) is odd, no such tree exists, and the answer is 0.\n   - **Even \\(n\\) Handling**: For even \\(n\\), the system of equations derived from the product conditions has a unique solution.

For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).\n   - **Distance Calculation**: The distance \\(d(1, n)\\) for a tree is the sum of the weights of the edges along the unique path from vertex 1 to vertex \\(n\\). The challenge is to efficiently compute the sum of \\(d(1, n)\\) over all good trees.\n\n3. **Optimization**:\n   - **PrÃ¼fer Code Insight**: Using PrÃ¼fer codes, we can generate all labeled trees.
