The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are counting the red spots (losses) for both players over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2·10^9, we cannot simulate each round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are repeated cyclically.\n\n Let:\n   m = len(A)\n   k = len(B)\n\n In round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses A[i % m] and Polycarpus uses B[i % k].\n\n We need to count the number of rounds where:\n   - Nikephoros loses: \n        A[i % m] is 'R' and B[i % k] is 'S'\n        OR A[i % m] is 'S' and B[i % k] is 'P'\n        OR A[i % m] is 'P' and B[i % k] is 'R'\n\n   - Polycarpus loses similarly.\n\n However, note: when they choose the same item, it's a draw (no red spot). So the losses are only when one beats the other.\n\n But note: if we have two cycles, we can break the entire sequence of n rounds into complete cycles of length LCM(m, k) but that might be too large (m, k up to 1000, so LCM could be up to 10^6, which is acceptable for n up to 2e9? Actually, we cannot iterate over 2e9 rounds. We need to use frequency counts and then use modulo arithmetic.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Let total_rounds = n.\n\n We can break the rounds by considering the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let L = LCM(m, k). Then in the first L rounds, the pattern of pairs (A[i % m], B[i % k]) repeats.\n\n But note: the two sequences cycle independently, so the pair (i % m, i % k) will repeat every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the LCM of m and k. Since m,k <= 1000, we can do that by:\n        LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)\n\n 2. Then, we can simulate one cycle of length L (which is at most 1000*1000 // gcd, so maximum 10^6, which is acceptable) and count the number of losses for each player in one cycle.\n\n 3. Then, let:\n        cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n 4. Then, the total losses for each player would be:\n        losses_Nikephoros = cycles * count_Nik_loss_in_cycle + additional losses from the first 'remainder' rounds (for Nik)\n        losses_Polycarpus = cycles * count_Pol_loss_in_cycle + additional losses from the first 'remainder' rounds (for Pol)\n\n 5. But wait: in one cycle, the same pattern of pairs appears, but note: the cycle has length L, and in that cycle, we have exactly m*k/LCM(m,k) = GCD(m,k) full repetitions of the pattern? Actually, no: the cycle of length L is the minimal period for the pairs (i mod m, i mod k). \n\n However, we don't need to worry about the repetitions within the cycle because we are just going to simulate the first L rounds and then multiply by the number of cycles.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n\n   Step 2: Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n   Step 3: Compute L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k). We can compute GCD using Euclid's algorithm.\n\n   Step 4: Simulate the first L rounds (if L is 0, but m,k>=1 so L>=1) and count:\n        For i in range(0, L):\n            a_index = i % m\n            b_index = i % k\n            a_char = A[a_index]\n            b_char = B[b_index]\n\n            Check if this round gives a loss for Nikephoros or Polycarpus.\n\n        We'll have two arrays (or two variables) for the counts in one cycle.\n\n   Step 5: Then, we break n into cycles and remainder.\n\n   However, note: we must be cautious because the cycle of length L is the fundamental period for the two sequences together.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also simulate without computing LCM by iterating over the indices modulo m and k separately, but using the LCM method is standard.\n\n   Step 6: Then, for the remaining 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1), we simulate again (this time from 0 to remainder-1) and add the losses.\n\n   But note: n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the losses without simulating each round individually, especially since the number of rounds can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the pattern of outcomes repeats every `L` rounds, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to simulate only one cycle of `L` rounds and then multiply the results by the number of full cycles, then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Compute LCM**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round in one cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) for both players.\n   - **Count Losses**: Multiply the losses from one cycle by the number of full cycles. For the remaining rounds, simulate them directly to count additional losses.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences. The simulation of one cycle is O(L), where `L` is the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible since the sequences are up to 1000 characters long.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    L = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    count_Nik_loss_cycle = 0\n    count_Pol_loss_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if (a_char, b_char) == ('R', 'S'):\n            count_Nik_loss_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('S', 'P'):\n            count_Nik_loss_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('P', 'R'):\n            count_Nik_loss_cycle += 1\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) == ('S', 'R'):\n            count_Pol_loss_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('R', 'P'):\n            count_Pol_loss_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('P', 'S'):\n            count_Pol_loss_cycle += 1\n            \n    cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    total_Nik_loss = cycles * count_Nik_loss_cycle\n    total_Pol_loss = cycles * count_Pol_loss_cycle\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if (a_char, b_char) == ('R', 'S'):\n            total_Nik_loss += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('S', 'P'):\n            total_Nik_loss += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('P', 'R'):\n            total_Nik_loss += 1\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) == ('S', 'R'):\n            total_Pol_loss += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('R', 'P'):\n            total_Pol_loss += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) == ('P', 'S'):\n            total_Pol_loss += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{total_Nik_loss} {total_Pol_loss}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length `L`.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one cycle, the code checks if the current move from `A` beats the move from `B` (indicating a loss for Polycarpus) or vice versa (indicating a loss for Nikephoros).\n4. **Loss Calculation**: The total losses for both players are calculated by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles and then adding the losses from any remaining rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance.",
