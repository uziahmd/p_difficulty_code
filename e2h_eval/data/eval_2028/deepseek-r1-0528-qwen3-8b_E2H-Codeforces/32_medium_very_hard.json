    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the current min or max (or both) if that element was the unique min or max.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` of size n, and let:\n   min_val = min(a)\n   max_val = max(a)\n\n After removing an element, the new instability will be:\n   If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max: then the min and max remain the same -> instability remains (max_val - min_val).\n   But note: there might be multiple min or max. So we cannot simply assume that.\n\n Actually, we have two types of removals:\n 1. Removing an occurrence of the minimum value (if there are duplicates, we might remove one of them and leave others)\n 2. Removing an occurrence of the maximum value.\n\n However, note that sometimes we might remove an element that is neither the global min nor the global max, but then the min and max remain unchanged.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal is:\n   Option 1: Remove an element that is the min (but there are duplicates for min). Then the new min becomes the next smallest value? Actually, no: if there are multiple mins, then even after removing one min, the min remains the same until we remove all occurrences of the min.\n\n Actually, let's sort the array and consider the possibilities.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Sort the array. Then the instability of the entire array is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n Now, if we remove one element, we can consider removing an element at index i (0-indexed) from the sorted array.\n\n Then the new array is:\n   [a[0], a[1], ..., a[i-1], a[i+1], ..., a[-1]]\n\n The new min is:\n   If i==0, then the new min is a[1] (if n>1, otherwise undefined but n>=2)\n   Otherwise, the min remains a[0] (because we didn't remove the smallest element? Not necessarily: if we remove the smallest element and there are duplicates, then we need to look at the next smallest)\n\n Similarly, the new max is:\n   If i==n-1, then the new max is a[n-2]\n   Otherwise, the max remains a[n-1]\n\n However, note: what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max? Then min and max remain the same.\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`.\n Possibilities:\n\n 1. Remove an element that is not the first or last element? Then the min and max remain the same.\n\n 2. Remove an element that is the first element (min): Then the new min becomes b[1] (if exists) and the max remains b[-1]. So the instability becomes b[-1] - b[1].\n 3. Remove an element that is the last element (max): Then the new max becomes b[-2] and the min remains b[0]. So the instability becomes b[-2] - b[0].\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is the first element but there are multiple first elements? Then the new min would still be the same as before? Actually, no: because we removed one occurrence, so the new min is the next smallest distinct value? \n\n Actually, if we have multiple minimums, then removing one minimum doesn't change the min. Similarly for maximum.\n\n Therefore, we must consider:\n\n The instability after removing an element at index i (in sorted array) is:\n\n   If the element is not the unique minimum and not the unique maximum, then the min and max don't change, so instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]).\n\n But wait: if we remove an element that is the minimum but there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change. Similarly for maximum.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We want to minimize the instability.\n\n How do we compute?\n\n Idea: \n   We can consider two cases: \n     Case 1: Removing an element that is the minimum (so the new min is either the same min (if there are duplicates) or the next smallest value (if we remove the last occurrence of the min)).\n     Case 2: Removing an element that is the maximum.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to keep the min and max the same. We are allowed to remove any one element.\n\n However, note: the goal is to minimize the instability.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n Then, the instability if we remove the element at position i is:\n   new_min = \n        if i == 0: then the new min is b[1] (if n>1) OR if n==2 then the array becomes one element -> then instability 0? But n>=2, and we remove one, so n-1>=1, and if n==2 then one element: then max-min=0.\n        else: the min remains b[0] (unless we are removing the last occurrence of b[0]? Actually, if there are multiple b[0] then even if we remove one, the min is still b[0] until we remove all. But note: we are only removing one element.\n\n Similarly for max.\n\n Actually, we can think: the instability of the array without the element at index i is:\n\n   new_min = \n        if i==0: then the next smallest is b[1] (if n>1) but wait, if we remove an element that is the min, then the new min is the smallest remaining. Since the array is sorted, the smallest remaining is b[1] (if we remove the first element, and if there are duplicates, then the first element is duplicated, but we remove one, so the smallest is still b[0] for the remaining? Actually no: if we remove one occurrence of b[0], then the remaining array has at least one b[0] (unless we remove the last occurrence). \n\n Correction: We are removing one element. So if we remove an element that is the first element (b[0]), then the new min is:\n   if there is another element equal to b[0] (i.e., if the first element is repeated) then the new min is still b[0] (because we have other elements with value b[0]).\n   Otherwise, if we remove the only occurrence of b[0], then the new min is b[1].\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we cannot simply use the next element in the sorted array without knowing the frequency.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: what are the candidate removals that can reduce the instability?\n\n The instability is determined by the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n We know that the overall instability of the array is (b[-1]-b[0]). Removing an element might help in reducing the gap by removing an extreme value.\n\n However, note: the instability can be reduced only if we remove an extreme value (min or max) and then the gap is determined by the next set of extremes.\n\n Actually, the minimal instability we can get is by considering:\n\n   candidate1: remove the first element (min) -> then the instability becomes (b[-1] - (b[1] if we removed the last occurrence of min?)) -> but we don't know if we removed the last occurrence.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove an extreme. However, if we remove a non-extreme, the instability remains the same as the original. So the best we can do is to try removing an extreme and see if we can get a lower instability.\n\n However, wait: maybe removing a non-extreme might not help? Only extremes can help.\n\n Actually, let's compare:\n\n Original instability: I0 = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same -> instability remains I0.\n\n If we remove an element that is the min (and there are duplicates for min) then the min remains the same -> instability remains I0.\n If we remove an element that is the min (and it's the only min) then the min becomes b[1] -> instability becomes (b[-1] - b[1])\n\n Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max (and it's the only max) then the instability becomes (b[-2] - b[0])\n If we remove an element that is the max (and there are duplicates for max) then the max remains the same -> instability remains I0.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum of:\n   (b[-1] - b[1])   [if we remove the min and it was the only min, then we get this]\n   (b[-2] - b[0])   [if we remove the max and it was the only max, then we get this]\n   and also consider: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max but the array has duplicates? Then the instability remains I0.\n\n But note: there is a possibility that removing an element that is not an extreme might actually be forced to be considered if the array has duplicates? Actually, no: because if we remove a duplicate min, the instability doesn't change, so it's same as original.\n\n However, note: the original instability is I0. We are trying to minimize. So we want to take the minimum between I0 (by removing a non-extreme or duplicate extreme) and the two values above (when we remove the only extreme).\n\n But wait: we are allowed to remove any one element. We can consider:\n\n   candidate_instability = min(\n        # Removing the first element (min) and it's the only min? Then instability = b[-1]-b[1]\n        # But if there are multiple mins, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so instability remains I0.\n\n        # Similarly for max.\n\n   However, we don't know the frequency. Instead, we can consider:\n\n   What are the candidate instabilities?\n\n   candidate1: remove the first element (if it is the only min) then candidate = b[-1] - b[1]\n   candidate2: remove the last element (if it is the only max) then candidate = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n   But also, if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then the instability remains I0.\n\n   Similarly for max.\n\n   However, note: we can also remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the instability remains I0.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n      I0   (removing a non-min and non-max, or a duplicate min or duplicate max)\n      candidate1: b[-1] - b[1]   (if we remove the first element and the first element is the only occurrence of the min? But wait, what if the first element is repeated? Then we have to check: if the first element is repeated, then removing one of them doesn't change the min. So we must check the condition: when we remove the first element, the new min is the next distinct value only if the first element is the only occurrence. Similarly for the last.\n\n   But note: we are not limited to removing the first or last element. We can remove any element. However, the extremes (min and max) are the critical ones.\n\n   Actually, the key observation is: the only removals that can lead to a lower instability than the original are those that remove one of the two extremes and they are the only occurrence of that extreme.\n\n   Why? Because if we remove an extreme and there are duplicates, the instability remains the same. And if we remove a non-extreme, the instability remains the same.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability is:\n\n        min( I0, candidate1, candidate2 )\n\n   But wait: what if the array has multiple mins and multiple maxes? Then both candidate1 and candidate2 are I0, so the answer is I0.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can choose to remove an element that is not an extreme and get I0, which might be the minimal.\n\n   But also, sometimes candidate1 and candidate2 might be lower than I0.\n\n   Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] (sorted: [1,3,3,7])\n        I0 = 6\n        candidate1: remove the only 1 -> then the array becomes [3,3,7] -> instability = 7-3 = 4\n        candidate2: remove the only 7 -> then the array becomes [1,3,3] -> instability = 3-1 = 2\n\n        So the minimal instability is min(6,4,2) = 2.\n\n   Example: [1,2,3,4,5] (sorted: [1,2,3,4,5])\n        I0 = 4\n        candidate1: remove 1 -> instability = 5-2 = 3\n        candidate2: remove 5 -> instability = 4-1 = 3\n        Then the minimal is min(4,3,3)=3.\n\n   Example: [1,1,1,1,2] (sorted: [1,1,1,1,2])\n        I0 = 1\n        candidate1: remove one 1 -> the min remains 1, so instability remains 1 (since the array becomes [1,1,1,2] -> max=2, min=1 -> 1)\n        candidate2: remove 2 -> the max becomes 1, so instability = 1-1 = 0.\n\n        Then minimal is 0.\n\n   Example: [1,1,2,2] (sorted: [1,1,2,2])\n        I0 = 1\n        candidate1: remove a 1 -> the min remains 1 (because there's still a 1) -> instability = 2-1 = 1\n        candidate2: remove a 2 -> the max remains 2 (because there's still a 2) -> instability = 2-1 = 1\n        Then minimal is 1.\n\n   Example: [1,100000] (n=2)\n        I0 = 99999\n        candidate1: remove 1 -> instability = 100000 - 100000 = 0? Actually, the array becomes [100000] -> min=100000, max=100000 -> 0.\n        candidate2: remove 100000 -> same.\n\n        Then minimal is 0.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and the array a.\n   Step 2: Sort the array.\n   Step 3: Let I0 = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n   Step 4: Consider two candidates:\n\n        candidate1 = None\n        candidate2 = None\n\n        How to handle duplicates? We need to check the frequency of the first element and the last element.\n\n        For candidate1 (removing the first element): \n            The new min is:\n                if the first element appears only once: then the new min is b[1] (if n>1, and if n==2 then the array has one element left, so the new min and max are the same, then instability 0)\n                if the first element appears more than once: then the min remains b[0] and the max remains b[-1] (unless we also remove the last element, but we are removing one) -> then the instability remains I0.\n\n            Actually, we don't need to know the frequency? We can simulate:\n\n            When we remove the first element, the new array is b[1:].\n\n            Then the new min is b[1] (if the array has at least two elements, which it does because n>=2 and we are removing one, so n-1>=1, but if n==2 then the new array has one element: then min and max are the same, so instability 0).\n\n            But note: the new array's min is the smallest element in b[1:], which is b[1] (if the array has more than one element) and if the array has one element, then min and max are that element.\n\n            Similarly, candidate2: remove the last element, the new array is b[:-1], then the new max is b[-2] (if the array has at least two elements, which it does because n>=2 and we remove one, so n-1>=1, and if n==2 then the array becomes [b[0]] -> instability 0).\n\n        However, note: the instability of the entire array is I0, but when we remove an element, the min and max change independently.\n\n        But wait, we don't need to consider the entire array's min and max separately for candidate1 and candidate2? Actually, we can compute:\n\n            candidate1_instability = (b[-1] - b[1]) if n > 2 else 0   # but wait, if n==2, then after removing the first element, the array has one element -> instability 0.\n\n            However, what if we have n==2? Then the array is [x,y] (sorted). \n                Removing x: instability = y - y = 0.\n                Removing y: instability = x - x = 0.\n\n            But wait, if we remove the first element (x), then the array is [y] -> instability 0.\n            Similarly, removing the last element (y) -> [x] -> 0.\n\n            But also, if n>2, then removing the first element: the array becomes [b[1], ... , b[-1]]. The min is b[1] and the max is b[-1] -> instability = b[-1]-b[1].\n\n            Similarly, removing the last element: the array becomes [b[0], ... , b[-2]] -> instability = b[-2]-b[0].\n\n        However, is that always true? \n\n            Example: [1,2,3] (n=3)\n                Remove first: [2,3] -> instability 1 (3-2=1)\n                Remove last: [1,2] -> instability 1 (2-1=1)\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] (n=3)\n                Remove first: [1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n                Remove last: [1,1] -> min=1, max=1 -> instability 0.\n\n            So for candidate2 (removing the last element) in [1,1,2]: \n                The array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n            But note: the last element is 2, and we remove it. The new max is the previous second last, which is 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate1 = (b[-1] - b[1]) if n > 2 else 0   [But wait, what if the array has duplicates at the beginning? Actually, the above formula for candidate1 does not account for duplicates at the beginning?]\n\n            Let me clarify: \n\n            When we remove the first element, the new min is the minimum of the remaining array. In the sorted array, the remaining array starts at b[1]. So the new min is b[1] (even if there are duplicates of the first element, because we are removing one occurrence, and the next element is the next distinct value or same as the first? Actually, if there are duplicates, then b[1] is still the same as b[0] (if we have duplicates). \n\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> remove the first element (which is 1) -> the array is [1,2]. The min is 1 (which is b[1] in the original array). So the instability is 2-1 = 1.\n\n            But wait, the original array's b[1] is 1, so the formula b[-1]-b[1] gives 2-1=1.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> remove first: [2,3] -> instability 1, which is 3-2 = 1, but using our formula: b[-1]=3, b[1]=2 -> 3-2=1.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1,2] -> remove first: [1,1,2] -> instability 1, which is 2-1=1. Our formula: b[-1]=2, b[1]=1 -> 2-1=1.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2,2] -> remove first: [1,2,2] -> instability 1, which is 2-1=1. Our formula: b[-1]=2, b[1]=1 -> 2-1=1.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2] -> remove first: [2,2] -> instability 0. Our formula: b[-1]=2, b[1]=2 -> 2-2=0.\n\n            So the formula for candidate1 is: b[-1] - b[1] (if n>1, but note: if n==2, then we have two elements, and after removing the first, the array has one element, so we cannot use b[1] because the index would be out of bounds). \n\n            We must handle n==2 separately.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            Removing an element at index i (0-indexed) from sorted array b:\n\n                If we remove the first element (i=0):\n                    The new min is b[1] (if n>1) and the new max is b[-1] (if n>1). But if n==2, then the new array has one element, so the min and max are that element, so instability 0.\n\n                Similarly, for the last element (i=n-1):\n                    The new max is b[-2] (if n>1) and the min is b[0]. Again, if n==2, then the new array has one element, so instability 0.\n\n            However, we are considering two candidates: removing the first element and removing the last element.\n\n            But note: the problem says we can remove any one element. However, the best improvement can only come from removing an extreme (min or max). Why? Because if we remove a non-extreme, the min and max remain the same. And if we remove an extreme but there is a duplicate, the min or max remains the same. So the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n                candidate1 = (if we remove the first element) then the instability is (b[-1] - (b[1] if n>1 else ???)) but wait, if n==2, then after removing the first, the array has one element -> 0.\n\n            Actually, we can generalize:\n\n            candidate1_instability = \n                if n == 2: 0\n                else: b[-1] - b[1]   [because the new min is b[1] and the max remains b[-1]]\n\n            candidate2_instability = \n                if n == 2: 0\n                else: b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            But wait, what if we remove the first element and the array has duplicates at the beginning? Then the new min is still the same as the old min? Actually no: the new min is the next element, which might be the same as the old min if there are duplicates.\n\n            However, our formula for candidate1_instability is b[-1]-b[1]. This works even if there are duplicates because b[1] is the next element (which might be the same as b[0] if duplicates). \n\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> candidate1_instability = 2-1 = 1, which is correct.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> candidate1_instability = 3-2 = 1, correct.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1,2] -> candidate1_instability = 2-1 = 1, correct.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2] -> candidate1_instability = 2-2 = 0, correct.\n\n            Similarly, candidate2_instability = b[-2]-b[0] (if n>2) and if n==2 then 0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> candidate2_instability = 2-1=1, correct.\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> candidate2_instability = 1-1=0, correct.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,4] -> candidate2_instability = 3-1=2, correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability remains I0.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n                candidate1_instability, candidate2_instability, and I0 (the original) ?\n\n            However, note: removing an element that is not an extreme doesn't change the instability, so we don't get a reduction. But if we remove an extreme that is duplicated, the instability remains I0. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1_instability, candidate2_instability, and I0.\n\n            But wait: I0 is the original instability, and if we remove a non-extreme or a duplicate extreme, we get I0. So we don't need to consider I0 separately because candidate1_instability and candidate2_instability might be larger than I0? Actually, no: sometimes removing an extreme might lead to a larger instability? \n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> I0=2, candidate1_instability=1, candidate2_instability=1 -> so the minimal is 1, which is less than I0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> I0=1, candidate1_instability=1, candidate2_instability=0 -> so the minimal is 0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,4] -> I0=3, candidate1_instability=3 (b[-1]-b[1]=4-2=2) -> wait, 4-2=2, and candidate2_instability=3-1=2, so the minimal is 2, which is less than I0=3.\n\n            Actually, note: \n                candidate1_instability = b[-1]-b[1] = 4-2=2\n                candidate2_instability = b[-2]-b[0] = 3-1=2\n                I0 = 3\n\n            But wait, is that the only candidates? What if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability remains 3. So the minimal is 2.\n\n            However, what if we remove the second element (which is 2) from [1,2,3,4]? Then the array is [1,3,4] -> instability=4-1=3, same as I0.\n\n            So the minimal is min(I0, candidate1_instability, candidate2_instability) = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to remove any element. The above two candidates (removing the first and the last) are the only ones that can potentially reduce the instability. Removing an element in the middle doesn't help.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                candidate1_instability = (b[-1] - b[1]) if n > 2 else 0\n                candidate2_instability = (b[-2] - b[0]) if n > 2 else 0\n\n            But wait, for n==2, we set both to 0.\n\n            However, note: the problem states that n>=2.\n\n            Then the answer is:\n\n                ans = min(I0, candidate1_instability, candidate2_instability)\n\n            But wait: what if n==2? Then I0 = b[-1]-b[0] (which is the same as the difference between the two numbers). Then candidate1_instability and candidate2_instability are both 0, so the answer is 0.\n\n            Example: [1,100000] -> I0=99999, candidate1_instability=0, candidate2_instability=0 -> ans=0, correct.\n\n            Example: [1,3,3,7] (n=4) -> I0=6, candidate1_instability=7-3=4, candidate2_instability=3-1=2 -> ans=min(6,4,2)=2, correct.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,4] (n=4) -> I0=3, candidate1_instability=4-2=2, candidate2_instability=3-1=2 -> ans=2.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] (n=3) -> I0=1, candidate1_instability=2-1=1, candidate2_instability=1-1=0 -> ans=0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] (n=3) -> I0=2, candidate1_instability=3-2=1, candidate2_instability=2-1=1 -> ans=1.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1,1,2] (n=5) -> I0=1, candidate1_instability=2-1=1, candidate2_instability=1-1=0 -> ans=0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4) -> I0=1, candidate1_instability=2-1=1, candidate2_instability=2-1=1 -> ans=1.\n\n            It seems to work.\n\n            However, wait: what if we have an array with more than two distinct values, but the removal of an element in the middle might sometimes lead to a lower instability? \n\n            Example: [1,2,100,200] (n=4)\n                I0 = 199\n                candidate1_instability = 200-2 = 198\n                candidate2_instability = 100-1 = 99\n\n                So the answer is 99.\n\n            But is 99 the minimal? \n                Removing the last element (200): [1,2,100] -> instability=100-1=99.\n\n                What if we remove the third element (100)? Then the array is [1,2,200] -> instability=200-1=199, same as I0.\n\n                What if we remove the second element (2)? Then the array is [1,100,200] -> instability=199.\n\n            So indeed, the minimal is 99.\n\n            Another example: [1,4,5,10] (n=4)\n                I0=9\n                candidate1_instability = 10-4=6\n                candidate2_instability = 5-1=4\n                So the answer is 4.\n\n            But wait, is there a way to get lower than 4? \n                Removing the last element (10): [1,4,5] -> max=5, min=1 -> 4, so yes.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n            Steps:\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              arr.sort()\n              I0 = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n\n              if n == 2:\n                  print(0)\n              else:\n                  candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n                  candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n                  ans = min(I0, candidate1, candidate2)\n                  print(ans)\n\n            However, wait: what if n==1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't need to worry.\n\n            But wait: the above code for n==2 prints 0, and for n>2 uses the two candidates.\n\n            However, note: the above formula for candidate1 and candidate2 when n==2 would access arr[-1] and arr[1] which are valid because for n==2, arr[1] is the last element and arr[-2] is the first element? Actually, in Python, for a list of 2 elements, arr[1] is the second element (index 1) and arr[-1] is the last (index 1) and arr[-2] is the first (index 0). But we are handling n==2 separately.\n\n            But wait, what if n==1? The problem says n>=2, so we don't need to handle.\n\n            However, let's test with n=3: [1,2,3] -> \n                candidate1 = 3-2=1, candidate2=2-1=1, I0=2 -> min(2,1,1)=1 -> correct.\n\n            But wait: what if the array has duplicates and we remove an element that is not the first or last? The above code does not consider that. But note: the problem allows removing any one element. However, the minimal instability is achieved by removing either the first or the last (if they are unique) or by removing a non-extreme (which leaves the instability as I0). And we are taking the minimum between I0 and the two candidate removals (which might be better than I0).\n\n            But wait: what if the array is [1,2,2,3] (n=4)?\n                I0 = 3-1=2\n                candidate1 = 3-2=1\n                candidate2 = 2-1=1\n                Then the answer is 1.\n\n            How is that achieved?\n                Removing the first element (1): [2,2,3] -> instability=3-2=1.\n                Removing the last element (3): [1,2,2] -> instability=2-1=1.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, note: the above formula for candidate1 and candidate2 is based on removing the first and last element. But what if the array has multiple distinct values and we can remove an element that is not the first or last and get a lower instability? \n\n            Example: [1,2,100,200] (n=4) -> we already saw that removing the last element gives 4, which is the minimal.\n\n            But wait, what if we remove the element 2? Then the array is [1,100,200] -> instability=199, which is worse.\n\n            So the minimal instability is achieved by removing either the first or the last element.\n\n            Why? Because the min and max are the extremes. Removing an extreme (if it is the only one) will bring the min or max closer, and that's the only way to reduce the instability.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            arr.sort()\n            if n == 2:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]   # remove the first element\n                candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]    # remove the last element\n                original_instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n                print(min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2))\n\n            But wait, the example [1,1,1,1,2] (n=5) -> \n                candidate1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n                candidate2 = 1 - 1 = 0\n                original_instability = 2-1=1\n                min(1,1,0)=0 -> correct.\n\n            However, what if we have an array with negative numbers? The problem states: \"elements of the array a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5)\", so all positive. So we don't have to worry about negatives.\n\n            But wait: the problem says the array elements are at least 1, so positive.\n\n            However, let me re-check the constraints: \"1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5\", so positive.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Note: We must read from stdin and output the answer.\n\n            But wait, why did we get 0 for n==2? Because the array has two elements, and removing one leaves one element, so instability 0.\n\n            However, note: the above code for n==2 is handled separately. But what if n==1? The problem says n>=2, so we don't need to handle.\n\n            Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: Input \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n                n=4, arr=[1,3,3,7]\n                candidate1 = 7-3=4\n                candidate2 = 3-1=2\n                original_instability=6\n                min(6,4,2)=2 -> Output 2, correct.\n\n            Example 2: Input \"2\\n1 100000\"\n                n=2 -> Output 0, correct.\n\n            However, wait: the example input format is given as two lines. The first line is \"4\" and the second is \"1 3 3 7\", and the second example is \"2\" and then \"1 100000\".\n\n            But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n                ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n            This means two test cases? Or one test case? Actually, the problem says:\n\n                The first line of the input contains one integer n.\n\n                The second line of the input contains n integers.\n\n            So it's one test case per run.\n\n            But the example input is provided as two separate strings. That might be for two examples. However, the problem is competitive programming and the input is one test case.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal instability can only be achieved by either removing the first element (smallest) or the last element (largest) from the sorted array. Removing any other element will not change the min and max values, thus leaving the instability unchanged. \n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements. The instability after removing the first element (if it's unique) is calculated as the difference between the last element and the second smallest element. Similarly, removing the last element (if it's unique) results in the instability being the difference between the second largest element and the first element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.\n   - **Candidate Calculation**: Compute three candidate instabilities:\n     - The original instability (max - min).\n     - The instability after removing the first element (if the array size is greater than 2, otherwise 0).\n     - The instability after removing the last element (if the array size is greater than 2, otherwise 0).\n   - **Result Determination**: The minimal value among these three candidates is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    arr.sort()\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n        candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n        original_instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n        ans = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Special Case Handling**: If the array size is 2, removing any element leaves a single-element array with instability 0.\n4. **Candidate Calculation**: For arrays larger than 2 elements:\n   - **candidate1** is the instability after removing the first element (smallest), calculated as the difference between the last element and the second smallest element.\n   - **candidate2** is the instability after removing the last element (largest), calculated as the difference between the second largest element and the first element.\n   - **original_instability** is the initial instability of the entire array.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal value among the three candidates is printed as the result, ensuring the optimal solution is found efficiently.",
