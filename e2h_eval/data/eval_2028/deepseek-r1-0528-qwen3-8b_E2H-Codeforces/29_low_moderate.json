Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with a problem that requires processing up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 characters.\n The challenge: We have to replace every occurrence of a digit (from '0' to '9') with a string (which can be empty) in a sequence of queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order, but if we do naive replacement (like replacing all '2' in \"123123\" with \"00\", then the next query replaces '3' with \"\"), we might end up with a very long string (the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, but the replacements can cascade).\n\n But wait: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, if we do replacements one by one, the string length might blow up (because after replacing a digit with a string, that string might contain digits that are subject to further replacement). However, note that the queries are given and they are to be performed in the given order.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\", then two queries: \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n   First query: replace every '2' with '0', so string becomes \"000\".\n   Second query: replace every '0' with '7', so string becomes \"777\".\n\n But note: the problem says Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries in the order which they need to be performed.\n\n However, if we try to do naive repeated scanning, the string might become too long. For example, if we have a string of 10^5 digits, and each replacement for a digit d expands it to a string of length L, then the length could grow exponentially in the worst-case.\n\n But note the constraint: the sum of the lengths of all ti (the replacement strings) is at most 10^5. This does not directly bound the expansion because one digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n However, observe: the queries are given in order. But we cannot simulate each query by scanning the entire string (which might be too long after some replacements) because the total length of the string might become huge (exponential growth).\n\n Alternative approach: We need to process the queries from last to first? Actually, note that the problem is asking for the final number modulo 1000000007.\n\n Insight: Instead of building the huge string, we can compute the result by processing the transformations in reverse? Or we can use dynamic programming to track the value and the length of the string after processing all the queries?\n\n However, note: the problem is that the same digit might be expanded to different things in different queries, and the expansion in one query depends on the expansion in the subsequent queries.\n\n Example: \n   Query1: \"2->00\"\n   Query2: \"0->1\"\n\n Then when processing the first query, we replace 2 by 00, and then the second query will replace each 0 in that 00 by 1, so 2 becomes \"11\". \n\n Therefore, the effect of a query depends on the later queries.\n\n So we must process the queries in the given order? But if we do, the string might become too long.\n\n Alternate idea: We can use a system of transformations that we apply from the last query backwards, updating the meaning of each digit.\n\n Let's denote by f_i(d) the string that the digit d is transformed to after processing all queries from i to n (i.e., the remaining queries). Then the transformation for the entire set of queries is the composition: f_1(d) = f_2( ... f_n(d) ... )\n\n However, the problem: the queries are sequential, so the first query is applied first, then the second, etc.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let F be the transformation that includes all queries. Then we want to compute the number represented by F(s).\n\n How to compute without building the whole string?\n\n We can represent the transformation as a function that maps a digit to a string (which is then transformed by the subsequent queries). But note: the total length of replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the intermediate strings can be huge.\n\n But note: the constraint says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. However, the same digit might be expanded multiple times (because the replacement string may contain digits). However, the key is that the queries are only for digits 0-9, and the initial string is digits.\n\n We can precompute for each digit, what is the final string after processing all queries? Then we can use dynamic programming or iterative propagation.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. We have up to 10 queries that change the meaning of the 10 digits. The catch: a query for a digit d is defined",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string. The challenge lies in efficiently handling these transformations without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to exponential growth in length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order (which could lead to exponentially large strings), we reverse the order of queries. This allows us to handle each digit's transformation by considering only the subsequent queries, thus optimizing the process.\n2. **Dynamic Digit Mapping**: For each digit (0-9), maintain a mapping that represents its final form after all relevant transformations. Initially, each digit maps to itself. As we process each query from last to first, we update the mappings for digits that are replaced or appear in the replacement strings.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the resulting number can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). This includes computing the numeric value of the transformed string and keeping track of the string's length for positional calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        queries.append(line)\n        \n    mapping = {str(i): str(i) for i in range(10)}\n    mapping_order = {}\n    for i, q in enumerate(queries):\n        d_char, t_str = q.split('->')\n        d_char = d_char.strip()\n        t_str = t_str.strip()\n        mapping_order[d_char] = i\n        \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        q = queries[i]\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        if d_char not in mapping_order or mapping_order[d_char] != i:\n            continue\n            \n        orig_d = d_char\n        new_str = ''\n        for char in t_str:\n            if char in mapping:\n                new_str += mapping[char]\n            else:\n                new_str += char\n                \n        mapping[orig_d] = new_str\n        \n    total_val = 0\n    power = 1\n    for char in s:\n        if char in mapping:\n            expanded = mapping[char]\n        else:\n            expanded = char\n            \n        num = int(expanded) % MOD\n        total_val = (total_val * power + num) % MOD\n        power = (power * pow(10, len(expanded), MOD)) % MOD\n        \n    print(total_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read. Each query is stored in a list.\n2. **Initial Mapping Setup**: A dictionary `mapping` is initialized where each digit (0-9) maps to itself. This will be updated as queries are processed.\n3. **Query Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit to be replaced and its replacement string are extracted. The replacement string is then processed by recursively applying any further transformations (handled by the `mapping` dictionary).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The transformed string is constructed by processing each character in the original string. For each character, if it exists in the `mapping`, its expanded form is used; otherwise, the character itself is used. The numeric value of the entire transformed string is computed using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure correctness.\n5. **Output**: The final result, the numeric value of the transformed string modulo 1000000007, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations by leveraging dynamic updates to digit mappings and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
