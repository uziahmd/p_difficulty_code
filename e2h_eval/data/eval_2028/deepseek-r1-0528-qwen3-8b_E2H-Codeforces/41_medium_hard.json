There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights with constraints.\n However, the restrictions are given as intervals and require that the maximum height in a given interval is at most x_i.\n\n Idea:\n We note that the profit is the sum of squares of the heights. Since the square function is convex, we might be tempted to use greedy or linear programming, but the constraints are small (n, m <=50) and the heights are integers from 0 to h (h<=50). \n\n But note: there are m restrictions, and each restriction gives an upper bound on the maximum height in an interval. The overall height in any spot must also not exceed h.\n\n We can consider building a system that enforces all the restrictions. One idea is to use state space reduction: \n However, the problem is similar to \"maximize sum of squares under linear constraints\" with integer variables.\n\n Alternatively, we can use constraint propagation and then solve by iterating over possible assignments? But 51^50 is too big.\n\n Another idea: use dynamic programming with state being the current position and the active constraints that are tight? But the constraints are overlapping and define maximums for entire intervals.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the restrictions are independent and the function is separable. But the constraints are not independent.\n\n Insight: Each house's height is constrained by multiple restrictions (if it falls in multiple intervals). The goal is to set each house to a value as high as possible (to maximize the square) without violating any restriction.\n\n However, note: if we set a house too high, it might break a restriction that covers that house. Therefore, for each house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of:\n   - h (global maximum)\n   - the upper bounds from all restrictions that cover house i.\n\n Then, we can set the height of house i to the minimum value (call it a_i) and then we get profit = sum(a_i^2). But wait, is that correct?\n\n Example 1: \n   Houses: [1,1] -> a_1 = min(h, 1) = 1\n           [2,2] -> a_2 = min(3, 3) = 3\n           [3,3] -> a_3 = min(3, 2) = 2\n   Then profit = 1+9+4 = 14 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: 4 houses, h=10, restrictions: [2,3] <=8, [3,4] <=7.\n   For house 1: no restriction? so a_1 = min(10, ... ) = 10.\n   For house 2: covered by [2,3] -> min(10,8)=8\n   For house 3: covered by both -> min(10,8,7)=7\n   For house 4: covered by [3,4] -> min(10,7)=7\n   Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> matches.\n\n But wait, is that always the case? What if we set one house to a lower value to allow others to be higher? \n\n However, note the objective function is separable and the square is increasing and convex. Also, the constraints are only upper bounds. There is no coupling between houses that would require one house to be reduced to let another be increased (because the square function is separable and we are only constrained by upper bounds). \n\n Therefore, for each house i, we can set it to the minimum of h and the maximums from all restrictions that include i. Then the profit is the sum of squares of these values.\n\n But wait: what if two restrictions conflict? Actually, the restrictions say \"the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_i\". So if we set a house to the minimum of the restrictions and h, then the tallest house in every interval will be at most the minimum of the x_i's that cover that interval, which is consistent with the restriction.\n\n However, note: if we set each house independently to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it, then in an interval [l, r] the maximum height is the maximum over j from l to r of (min(h, all restrictions covering j)). But note: if a restriction says the entire interval must have max <= x_i, then we require that for every house j in [l, r], the assigned height is <= x_i. And since we set each house j to the minimum of h and the restrictions including j, then if there is no restriction that forces a house j to be below x_i, then we set it to min(h, ...) which might be above x_i? \n\n Let me reexamine: \n\n In fact, the independent assignment described above does not necessarily satisfy the restrictions. Consider:\n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [1,1] <= 3\n\n Then, according to the independent assignment:\n   House1: min(10, 3) = 3\n   House2: min(10, 5) = 5\n   Then the interval [1,2] has maximum = 5, which satisfies the first restriction. \n\n Now consider a different example:\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [1,2] <= 3\n\n Then, independent assignment for each house:\n   House1: min(10, 3) = 3\n   House2: min(10, 3) = 3\n   Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 3, which satisfies both.\n\n Now consider a third example:\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 3\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 3\n   But no restriction for [1,2]. Then independent assignment sets house1=3, house2=3. Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 3, which is allowed if there is no explicit restriction? Yes, because the restrictions only specify that the tallest house in [1,1] must be <=3 and [2,2] must be <=3. There is no restriction saying the entire [1,2] must be <= something. So the independent assignment is valid.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"The city has m zoning restrictions.\" and each restriction is independent. So if a house is only in one restriction, then we set it to the minimum of h and the x_i of that restriction. But if a house is in two restrictions, then we set it to the minimum of h and the two x_i's.\n\n But note: the restrictions are applied independently. The problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". This is an independent condition. Therefore, the entire assignment must satisfy all restrictions. The independent assignment (each house set to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it) ensures that for every restriction i, the maximum house in [l_i, r_i] is at most the minimum x_i that applies to any house in that interval? \n\n Actually, no. Consider:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 10\n   Restriction3: [1,2] <= 5\n\n Then, independent assignment:\n   House1: min(10, 10, 5) = 5\n   House2: min(10, 10, 5) = 5\n   Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 5, which satisfies restriction3.\n\n But what if the restrictions are not the same? \n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 10\n   Restriction3: [1,2] <= 5\n\n Wait, the independent assignment is actually setting each house to the minimum of all restrictions that cover it (including the global h). But note: the global h is already included. \n\n However, consider:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 5\n   Restriction3: [1,2] <= 10\n\n Then independent assignment:\n   House1: min(10,5) = 5\n   House2: min(10,5) = 5\n   Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 5, which is <=10 -> valid.\n\n But now, what if:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 10\n   Restriction3: [1,2] <= 5\n\n Independent assignment: \n   House1: min(10,10,5) = 5\n   House2: min(10,10,5) = 5 -> valid.\n\n However, what if we have:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=3\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 10\n   Restriction3: [1,2] <= 5\n\n How do we know that the independent assignment satisfies all restrictions? It does because for Restriction3, we set both houses to at most 5, so the maximum in [1,2] is 5<=5.\n\n But note: the independent assignment sets each house to the minimum of h and the x_i for every restriction that includes that house. Therefore, for a given house j, if it is included in a restriction with x_i, then house j is set to <= x_i. Then, for any restriction i, the entire interval [l_i, r_i] is set to values that are <= x_i (because every house in [l_i, r_i] is included in restriction i, so set to <= x_i). Therefore, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n However, wait: what if a house is not explicitly included in a restriction? Then we set it to h (the global maximum). But note: the global h is the upper bound for every house. Then, if a restriction i does not explicitly appear for a house j in [l_i, r_i], then we set house j to h (which might be above x_i). \n\n Let me clarify: The independent assignment uses the minimum of h and all the restrictions that cover the house. But note: the problem says that the house can be built with an integer between 0 and h. The restrictions are additional: they say that in a particular interval the maximum must be <= x_i. So if a house is in an interval [l_i, r_i], then we must have that house <= x_i. Otherwise, if it is not in any restriction, then we can set it to h.\n\n Therefore, for house j, we must set it to the minimum of:\n   h (global)\n   and the x_i for every restriction that includes house j.\n\n Then, the entire assignment satisfies all restrictions.\n\n Now, is this optimal? Because the profit function is the sum of squares, and the square is increasing and convex, we want to set each house as high as possible. The independent assignment sets each house to the maximum value allowed by the constraints (since we are taking the minimum of the constraints, and we cannot exceed the constraints). Therefore, we are maximizing each house independently.\n\n However, note: the constraints are coupled. But the constraints are only upper bounds. There is no benefit in reducing one house to allow another to be higher (because the objective function is separable and the square function is increasing). \n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each house i (from 1 to n) the minimum value M_i = min( h, x_i for every restriction i that covers house j )\n\n   Step 2: The profit is the sum_{i=1}^{n} (M_i)^2.\n\n But wait: is that really the maximum? Consider that we are forced to set each house to M_i. And since the square function is increasing, we cannot set any house higher than M_i without breaking a constraint. And we can set each house to M_i (and that satisfies all constraints). Therefore, it is optimal.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   n=3, h=3, m=3\n   Restrictions: [1,1] <=1, [2,2]<=3, [3,3]<=2.\n\n   House1: min(3, 1) = 1\n   House2: min(3, 3) = 3\n   House3: min(3, 2) = 2\n   Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14 -> correct.\n\n Example 2:\n   n=4, h=10, m=2\n   Restrictions: [2,3] <=8, [3,4] <=7.\n\n   House1: no restriction? -> min(10) = 10\n   House2: covered by [2,3] -> min(10,8)=8\n   House3: covered by both -> min(10,8,7)=7\n   House4: covered by [3,4] -> min(10,7)=7\n   Profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> correct.\n\n However, wait: what if a house is not covered by any restriction? Then we set it to h. And that's the maximum allowed.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\", meaning that if a house is not covered by any restriction, then there is no restriction that forces it to be below h. So we set it to h.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n, h, m.\n\n   Initialize an array `min_height` of length n (for houses 0-indexed) with h (the global maximum).\n\n   For each restriction (m times):\n        l, r, x = map(int, line.split())\n        Then for each house index j from l-1 to r-1:\n            min_height[j] = min(min_height[j], x)\n\n   Then, compute profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            profit += min_height[i] * min_height[i]\n\n   Print profit.\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple restrictions? We are updating the min_height for each house with the minimum of the x's from the restrictions that cover it and the initial h.\n\n However, note: the global h is the upper bound. Then we take the minimum with the restrictions. So if a restriction has x_i < h, then we reduce the house to x_i. Otherwise, we leave it at h.\n\n However, note: the problem says the house can be built with an integer between 0 and h. But the above method sets the house to the minimum of h and the restrictions. But is that the maximum allowed? Yes, because we cannot exceed the restrictions and we cannot exceed h.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the house is built to the maximum allowed? We are trying to maximize the profit. And the profit is maximized by building as high as possible (since a^2 is increasing). Therefore, we set each house to the maximum allowed, which is the minimum of h and the restrictions.\n\n However, wait: what if we set a house to a value lower than the maximum allowed? Then the profit would be lower. So we don't need to consider that.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   min_height = [h] * n   # n houses, initially set to h\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < min_height[j]:\n                min_height[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for val in min_height:\n        total += val * val\n\n   print(total)\n\n Let's run the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   n=3, h=3, m=3\n   min_height = [3,3,3]\n\n   First restriction: [1,1] -> l=1, r=1, x_val=1 -> update index0 to min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n   Second restriction: [2,2] -> l=2, r=2, x_val=3 -> update index1 to min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3]\n   Third restriction: [3,3] -> l=3, r=3, x_val=2 -> update index2 to min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n\n   Profit = 1+9+4=14.\n\n Example 2:\n   n=4, h=10, m=2\n   min_height = [10,10,10,10]\n\n   First restriction: [2,3] (so indices 1,2) with x_val=8 -> update index1 and index2 to min(10,8)=8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n   Second restriction: [3,4] (indices 2,3) with x_val=7 -> update index2: min(8,7)=7; update index3: min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n\n   Profit = 10*10 + 8*8 + 7*7 + 7*7 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n However, wait: the second example input was:\n      \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n But in the example, the first restriction is [2,3] and the second is [3,4]. Our code updates the second restriction to [3,4] (indices 2 and 3) correctly.\n\n But note: the example output was 262, and our code produces 262.\n\n However, wait: why did the example say: \"In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights [10,8,7,7]\"?\n   Our assignment is [10,8,7,7] -> matches.\n\n But wait, what if we set house4 to 7 and house3 to 7, but what about house2? We set house2 to 8. Is that the best? Yes, because the first restriction requires the maximum in [2,3] to be at most 8. Since house3 is 7, we can set house2 to 8. And house1 is 10, which is allowed because the first restriction only restricts [2,3] and the second [3,4] doesn't cover house1.\n\n But wait, is there a way to set house1 to more than 10? No, because h=10.\n\n So the code should work.\n\n However, note: the problem says the house can be built with an integer between 0 and h. We are setting the house to the maximum allowed (min_height) and then using that value. But note: the square function is defined for nonnegative integers. The problem does not force us to set the house to the maximum allowed? Actually, we are allowed to set the house to any integer from 0 to min_height. But since the profit is the square, we want to set it to min_height to maximize the profit.\n\n However, what if we set a house to less than min_height? Then the profit decreases. So we don't want that.\n\n Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"In each spot, if a house has height a, you will gain a^2 dollars\". And we are setting each house to the maximum allowed (min_height). That is the best we can do.\n\n However, note: the independent assignment does not consider that sometimes we might set a house lower to allow adjacent houses to be higher? But the constraints are only upper bounds and the objective is separable. There is no downside to setting a house to its maximum allowed value. \n\n But consider: what if two houses are constrained by overlapping restrictions? Actually, the independent assignment sets each house to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it. Then, the condition for a restriction i is automatically satisfied because every house in the interval is set to at most x_i. \n\n However, there is a catch: the problem does not require that the house is set to the maximum allowed? But wait, the goal is to maximize the profit. The profit is the sum of squares. Since the square function is increasing, we want to set each house to the highest value allowed (which is the min_height). \n\n But note: the restrictions might force a house to be lower than necessary for the adjacent ones, but since the profit is independent, we just set each house to the highest it can be.\n\n However, consider the following example:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [1,2] <= 10\n\n Then the independent assignment sets both houses to 5 (because of the first restriction). Then the profit is 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n But what if we set house1 to 10 and house2 to 5? Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 10, which violates the first restriction (which requires <=5). So that is not allowed.\n\n Another example:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 5\n\n Then independent assignment: house1=5, house2=5 -> profit 25+25=50.\n\n Now, what if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 10? Then the second restriction is violated because house2=10>5.\n\n So the independent assignment is indeed the maximum allowed for each house.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning holds because the constraints are only upper bounds and the objective function is separable and increasing.\n\n But wait, what if we have:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [1,1] <= 5\n\n Then independent assignment: house1 = min(10,5)=5, house2 = min(10,10)=10.\n\n Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 10, which is allowed by restriction1. And house1 is 5 which satisfies restriction2.\n\n But what if we set house2 to 10? Then the interval [1,2] is 10, which is allowed by restriction1 (which says <=10). So that is okay.\n\n But note: the independent assignment sets house2 to 10 because the only restriction covering house2 is restriction1 (x_val=10). But wait, the independent assignment considers all restrictions that cover the house. Here, house2 is only covered by restriction1, so set to min(10,10)=10.\n\n Now, consider:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 10\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 5\n\n Then independent assignment: house1 = min(10,10)=10, house2 = min(10,5)=5.\n\n Then the interval [1,2] has maximum 10, which is allowed by restriction1, but wait: restriction2 says the tallest house in [2,2] must be <=5 -> satisfied. However, note: the interval [1,2] is covered by restriction1 (which allows up to 10) and house1 is set to 10, which is allowed by restriction1. But is there any other restriction that restricts house1? Only restriction1, so 10 is allowed.\n\n However, what if we set house1 to 5? Then we get profit 25+25=50, but if we set house1 to 10, then we get 100+25=125, which is better.\n\n So the independent assignment is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the restrictions are such that a house is not covered by any restriction? Then we set it to h, which is the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   min_vals = [h] * n\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n        # Adjust indices: l-1 to r-1\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < min_vals[i]:\n                min_vals[i] = x_val\n\n   total = sum(val * val for val in min_vals)\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem says the house can be built from 0 to h. Our assignment sets the house to the minimum of h and the restrictions. But what if we set a house to a value higher than the minimum? Then we break a constraint. And if we set it lower, we get less profit. Therefore, the assignment is optimal.\n\n But wait: the above code uses the minimum of h and the restrictions. However, note that the global h is the upper bound, and the restrictions are also upper bounds. We are effectively taking the minimum of all upper bounds.\n\n However, there is a possibility that the same house is covered by multiple restrictions, and we take the minimum x_val among them. That is correct because the house must be <= every x_val from the restrictions that cover it.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says the restrictions are given as (l_i, r_i, x_i). We are processing them one by one, updating the min_vals for the houses in the interval. This is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem does not guarantee that the restrictions are given in any particular order. But updating min_vals for each restriction is independent.\n\n Let me test with an alternate order for the first example:\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          2 2 3\n          1 1 1\n          3 3 2\n\n        Then min_vals starts as [3,3,3]\n        First restriction: [2,2] -> x_val=3 -> update index1 to 3 (no change)\n        Second restriction: [1,1] -> x_val=1 -> update index0 to 1\n        Third restriction: [3,3] -> x_val=2 -> update index2 to 2\n        Result: [1,3,2] -> same.\n\n Therefore, the order does not matter.\n\n We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that n, m, h are at most 50. The inner loop runs at most 50 times per restriction, and m<=50, so the total operations are at most 50*50=2500, which is acceptable.\n\n Let's write the code.\n\n But wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then min_vals remains [h]*n, and the profit is n*h*h.\n\n Example: n=1, h=5, m=0 -> profit=25.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   min_vals = [h] * n\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < min_vals[j]:\n                min_vals[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for val in min_vals:\n        total += val * val\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, wait: the example input format is given as two examples. The first example is:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n But note: the example input is provided as two separate strings. We are reading from stdin. The problem says to read from stdin.\n\n We assume that the input is given in the standard way.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as two separate lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n   Input: \n        3 3 3\n        1 1 1\n        2 2 3\n        3 3 2\n\n   and\n\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n However, the problem says: \"Each of the next m lines contains ...\"\n\n So we read the first line, then the next m lines.\n\n We are doing:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n\n This will read m lines.\n\n But note: the example input is two separate test cases? Actually, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives two examples. But in the problem, there is only one test case per run.\n\n The problem says: \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\"\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n However, the example input is given as two separate examples. In the actual competition, there would be one test case.\n\n But the sample input in the example is given as two separate strings. The problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then lists two inputs and two outputs.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the number of test cases. The input format says the first line has n, h, m, then m lines.\n\n So we assume one test case.\n\n However, the example input is provided as two separate examples. But when running the program, we are given one input.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n This is two test cases? Or is it two examples? The problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" and then gives two examples.\n\n Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Input:\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   Output:\n        ['14', '262']\n\n So the input is two separate test cases? \n\n But note: the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input is given as two strings. \n\n However, in competitive programming, the input is usually one test case. But the example input is provided as two test cases.\n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n\n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n   Then it says:\n\n   Input:\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n But wait, the example input is two separate test cases? Or is it one string containing two test cases? Actually, the problem says \"Input\" and then shows two strings. But in the context, the problem expects one test case.\n\n After reading the problem statement, it says:\n\n   \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1<=n,h,m<=50) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.\"\n\n   Then \"Each of the next m lines ...\"\n\n So we are reading one test case.\n\n The example input is two test cases. But the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n However, the example output is two integers.\n\n But the problem says \"Print a single integer\".\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n But the example input is provided as two test cases. This might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n Clarification: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then gives two examples. The examples are separate.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n But if the input is two test cases, then we need to read until EOF. However, the problem says m is the number of restrictions and the next m lines.\n\n How to handle multiple test cases? The problem does not specify.\n\n Looking at the constraints (n, m, h <=50), and the input format, we assume one test case.\n\n But the example input is given as two separate test cases. \n\n Actually, the example input is provided as two separate strings. This might be because the problem statement is showing two examples. In reality, we are to run the program and it will be given one test case.\n\n However, the problem says:\n\n   Input:\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   Output:\n        ['14', '262']\n\n This implies two test cases.\n\n But wait, the problem statement says:\n\n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n   Then the input format is described.\n\n   Then the example input is two strings.\n\n   Then the example output is two integers.\n\n So it is likely that the problem expects multiple test cases. But the problem statement says \"Print a single integer\".\n\n There's a contradiction.\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n   \"You are planning to build housing on a street. There are n spots available ... The city has m zoning restrictions ... Determine the maximum profit possible.\"\n\n   Then the input format.\n\n   Then the example input and output.\n\n The example input is provided as two separate lines? Actually, the example input is two strings, but in the problem statement they are shown as two separate examples.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Input\" and then gives two strings. This is ambiguous.\n\n However, the problem constraints say that n, m, h are at most 50, and m is the number of restrictions.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, and the example input is two test cases, we must assume that there could be multiple test cases.\n\n But wait, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input format is described for one test case.\n\n How can we resolve?\n\n Let's look at the sample input:\n\n   Example1: n=3, h=3, m=3 -> three restrictions.\n\n   Example2: n=4, h=10, m=2 -> two restrictions.\n\n If we are to read multiple test cases, then we would read the first line, then the next m lines, then the next test case.\n\n But the problem does not specify how many test cases.\n\n However, the sample input is provided as two separate examples. \n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the constraints are small, we can read until EOF.\n\n But the problem says \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", so the first line is the start of a test case.\n\n We can do:\n\n   while True:\n        try:\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        except EOFError:\n            break\n        # process the test case\n\n   Then for each test case, read m lines.\n\n However, the problem says \"Print a single integer\", meaning one integer per test case.\n\n But the example output is two integers.\n\n So we must output the profit for each test case.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n Given the example, I think we should handle multiple test cases.\n\n However, the problem statement says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input format. Then the example input and output.\n\n Since the example input is two test cases, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n But the problem constraints say n, m, h <=50, and m is the number of restrictions. The total number of test cases is not bounded by the constraints.\n\n We can do:\n\n   while True:\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        n = int(data[0]); h = int(data[1]); m = int(data[2])\n        # Then read m lines\n\n   Then output the profit for each test case.\n\n But wait, the problem says the first line has n, h, m, then m lines.\n\n However, if we are reading until EOF, then we break when there's no more input.\n\n But the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n Since the problem statement example input is two test cases, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended one test case and the example input is just two examples.\n\n But the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input format, and then the example input is two test",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints specify that the tallest house in any given interval must not exceed a certain height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves setting the height of each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction dictates that the maximum height in a specified interval must be at most a given value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights, which encourages setting each house's height as high as possible without violating any constraints.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the smallest value among the global maximum height (`h`) and all the restrictions that include that house. This is because any restriction covering the house imposes an upper bound on its height, and the house must comply with all such restrictions.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Initializing each house's height to the global maximum (`h`).\n   - For each restriction, update the heights of the houses within the specified interval to the minimum of their current height and the restriction's maximum height.\n   - After processing all restrictions, compute the profit by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating the heights of the houses within each interval. With `n` houses and `m` restrictions, each restriction can involve up to `n` houses, leading to a time complexity of O(n*m). Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    index = 0\n    results = []\n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        n = int(parts[0])\n        h = int(parts[1])\n        m = int(parts[2])\n        min_vals = [h] * n\n        \n        index += 1\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if index >= len(data) or not data[index].strip():\n                break\n            parts_line = data[index].split()\n            index += 1\n            l = int(parts_line[0])\n            r = int(parts_line[1])\n            x_val = int(parts_line[2])\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x_val < min_vals[j]:\n                    min_vals[j] = x_val\n                    \n        total_profit = 0\n        for val in min_vals:\n            total_profit += val * val\n        results.append(str(total_profit))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first line contains the number of houses (`n`), the global maximum height (`h`), and the number of restrictions (`m`).\n2. **Initialization**: Each house's initial height is set to `h`, the global maximum.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the heights of the houses within the specified interval to the minimum of their current height and the restriction's maximum height. This ensures compliance with all zoning restrictions.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n5. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed, each on a separate line.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal profit by leveraging the separability of the objective function and the independence of the constraints.",
