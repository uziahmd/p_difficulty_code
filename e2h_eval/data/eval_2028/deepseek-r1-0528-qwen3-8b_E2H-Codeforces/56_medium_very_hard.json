Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. The problem is to check if there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight lines connecting each spaceship to its base do not intersect.\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can consider using a combinatorial matching approach. However, note that the condition of non-intersecting paths is geometric.\n\n Observation:\n We have 2R+2B points (R spaceships and B bases). The condition is that the set of segments (each segment from a spaceship to a base) must not intersect.\n\n But note: we are assigning exactly one spaceship to one base. There might be multiple ways to assign, but we require that in the chosen assignment, the segments do not cross.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire set of segments to be drawn without any crossings? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\".\n\n So, we need to check for a matching M (a set of |R|=|B| edges) such that no two edges in M intersect (except possibly at endpoints, but note: the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about overlapping).\n\n But note: the bases and spaceships are distinct sets? The input says: first R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching (because we need equal number of spaceships and bases). But wait, the input says: first line has R and B, then R lines for spaceships and B lines for bases. And R, B >= 1 and <=10. So we can check at the beginning: if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n 2. However, note that the example: \n        Input: \"3 3 ...\" -> Yes\n        Input: \"2 1 ...\" -> No\n\n    So indeed, the first number is R (spaceships) and second is B (bases). If R != B, then we cannot have a perfect matching (each base one guardian and each spaceship one base) so output 'No'.\n\n 3. But wait: the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we need R = B.\n\n 4. Approach:\n\n    Since R, B <= 10, we can try to use backtracking (brute force) to try all permutations (if R=B, then we are looking for a permutation of the bases for the spaceships). There are R! possibilities, which is 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case for a computer, but we can do better by using recursive backtracking with pruning.\n\n    However, we can also use the following:\n\n    - We have two sets: S (spaceships) and Bases (bases). We want to assign each spaceship to a base.\n\n    - Condition: the set of segments { (s_i, base_j) for the assigned pair } must not have any two segments intersect (except at endpoints, but since the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, we don't have to worry about degenerate cases).\n\n    How to check for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) to intersect?\n\n        We can use the standard method: check the orientation of the four points.\n\n        Let orient(A,B,C) = (Bx - Ax)*(Cy - Ay) - (By - Ay)*(Cx - Ax)\n\n        Then, two segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n          (orient(A,B,C) * orient(A,B,D) < 0) and (orient(C,D,A) * orient(C,D,B) < 0)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the assignment is a perfect matching, and the segments are from a spaceship to a base. But note: we are only concerned with the assigned pairs. Also, the bases and spaceships are fixed sets.\n\n    But note: the condition must hold for every pair of edges in the matching. However, note that the matching is a set of disjoint edges. The condition is that no two edges (from different pairs) intersect.\n\n    However, we are allowed to choose the matching. So we need to find a matching (a set of |R| edges) such that no two edges intersect.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n      Step 1: Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\n      Step 2: Read the next R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n      Step 3: We have two lists: \n          spaceships = [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...]\n          bases = [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...]   (size R)\n\n      Step 4: We are going to try to assign the bases to the spaceships. We can fix the order of spaceships (say, by index) and then consider permutations of the bases.\n\n      Step 5: For a candidate permutation p (which assigns base i to spaceship j, meaning we connect spaceship j to base p[j]), we need to check that the set of segments (spaceship j to base p[j]) for j=0..R-1 do not intersect.\n\n      Step 6: How to check for intersections in a set of segments?\n\n          We have R segments. We can check every pair of segments (each segment is defined by a spaceship and a base) for intersection.\n\n          But note: the segments are defined by the matching. We must check that no two segments (from two different pairs) cross.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not allow any two paths to intersect. But note: the endpoints are distinct and the lines are straight. The condition is that the straight lines (the segments) do not cross.\n\n      Step 7: We can write a helper function:\n\n          def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n              # seg1 = (A, B) where A and B are points (tuples)\n              # seg2 = (C, D) similarly.\n\n              # Using the orientation method.\n\n          But note: two segments AB and CD intersect if the four points are such that the two segments are crossing. However, we must be cautious because the segments are from spaceships to bases, and they are distinct. We don't have to worry about the same point being used twice.\n\n      Step 8: Alternatively, we can use the standard method:\n\n          Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if:\n\n            (p1 and q1 are on opposite sides of the line through p2 and q2) and (p2 and q2 are on opposite sides of the line through p1 and q1)\n\n          But there are special cases: if the points are colinear, but the problem states that no three points are collinear. So we can ignore the colinear case.\n\n          We can use the cross product (orientation) method:\n\n          Let us define:\n\n            def orientation(A, B, C):\n                # returns the cross product of vectors AB and AC\n                return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n          Then, two segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n            o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n            o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n            and (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n          However, this condition is necessary and sufficient for general position (no three colinear) and when the intersection is interior to the segments.\n\n      Step 9: But note: what if one segment lies entirely on the other? But the problem states \"no three points are collinear\", so this cannot happen.\n\n      Step 10: Now, we can iterate over all permutations of bases (of size R) and check the matching. However, 10! is 3.6 million, and for each permutation we check C(R,2) = 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks (each orientation is O(1)). So total operations: 3.6e6 * 45 * 4 = about 648e6 operations, which might be borderline in Python, but note that R is at most 10, and in worst-case we have 10 bases, so 10! = 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be careful.\n\n      However, note that the problem says R, B up to 10, and 10! is 3628800. We can do:\n\n          for perm in itertools.permutations(bases_list):\n              # build list of segments: [ (spaceship[i], bases_list[perm[i]]) for i in range(R) ]\n\n          Then check for every pair of segments (i, j) with i < j: if they intersect, break and try next permutation.\n\n      Step 11: But wait, is there a way to prune earlier? Maybe we can sort the spaceships and bases and use a smarter matching? However, the problem is small.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use recursion/backtracking and check as we assign, but the above brute-force with permutations is acceptable for n=10.\n\n      However, let me calculate: 10! = 3628800. For each permutation, we do C(10,2)=45 checks, each check 4 orientation computations (each orientation is 4 multiplications and subtractions). So 45*4 = 180 per permutation. Then total operations: 3628800 * 180 = 653,088,000 operations. Each operation is a few arithmetic operations. This might be acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python it might take a few seconds.\n\n      But note: the constraints say R, B <= 10, but worst-case R=B=10. We can try to optimize by breaking early if an intersection is found.\n\n      However, we can also note: the matching condition is that the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting. There might be a way to check without building the entire set? But the standard way is to check every pair.\n\n      Step 12: Another idea: we can use the fact that the problem is about non-intersecting segments. There is a known result that a set of segments is non-intersecting if and only if the graph is planar? But that is too abstract.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following: draw the points and consider the arrangement. But we are stuck with the brute-force.\n\n      Step 13: Implementation:\n\n          Read R, B.\n          If R != B: print('No') and exit.\n\n          Read the next R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n          If R == 0: then we have 0 bases? but R==0 and B==0, then matching exists (empty matching) -> output 'Yes'. But the constraint says R, B>=1, so skip.\n\n          Write a helper function:\n\n          def orientation(A, B, C):\n              return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n          Then:\n\n          def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n              A, B = seg1\n              C, D = seg2\n              o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n              o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n              o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n              o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n              # Check if the orientations are opposite for both segments\n              if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                  return True\n              return False\n\n          Then, we generate all permutations of the bases (which has length R). For each permutation p:\n\n              Let matching = []\n              for i in range(R):\n                  s = spaceships[i]\n                  b = bases_perm[i]   # actually, we stored bases in a list, and we are permuting them.\n                  # But note: the permutation is a tuple of indices? Actually, we are using itertools.permutations(bases) so we get a tuple of base points.\n\n              Then, we form the list of segments: [ (spaceships[i], bases_perm[i]) for i in range(R) ]\n\n              Then, we check for any two distinct segments in this list that intersect.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                  segments = []\n                  for i in range(R):\n                      segments.append( (spaceships[i], bases_perm[i]) )\n\n                  for i in range(len(segments)):\n                      for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                          if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n                              break the inner loop and mark this permutation as invalid.\n\n                  If we complete the double loop without finding any intersection, then we found a valid matching.\n\n          Then we can break and output 'Yes'\n\n          If none of the permutations is valid, output 'No'\n\n      Step 14: However, note: the problem does not specify that the bases are labeled arbitrarily. Our permutation is over the bases (we have a fixed list of bases). But the problem does not specify an order for the bases. So we are considering every possible assignment.\n\n      Step 15: But wait: the problem says the bases are given in B lines. We are reading them in order. However, the assignment does not require the base order to be preserved. We are generating all permutations, so that is correct.\n\n      Step 16: However, there is a catch: the condition of non-intersecting might depend on the drawing. But note: the condition is purely geometric. We are checking the segments.\n\n      Step 17: Example: \n\n          Input: \n              3 3\n              0 0\n              2 0\n              3 1\n              -2 1\n              0 3\n              2 2\n\n          We have 3 spaceships and 3 bases.\n\n          One valid matching is: \n            spaceship0 (0,0) -> base0 (-2,1)\n            spaceship1 (2,0) -> base1 (0,3)\n            spaceship2 (3,1) -> base2 (2,2)\n\n          But wait, let me plot:\n\n          Spaceships: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n          Bases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\n          The example says output 'Yes'. \n\n          However, note: the example says \"one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order\". \n\n          The order of bases in the input is: first base (-2,1), second (0,3), third (2,2).\n\n          So if we assign:\n            spaceship0 -> base0: (0,0) to (-2,1): this is a segment from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n            spaceship1 -> base1: (2,0) to (0,3): (2,0) to (0,3)\n            spaceship2 -> base2: (3,1) to (2,2): (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n          Now, do these segments intersect?\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n          Segment2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n          Segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n          Check segment1 and segment2:\n\n            Line1: from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n            Line2: from (2,0) to (0,3)\n\n          The midpoint of segment1: (-1, 0.5) and segment2: (1, 1.5). They are not obviously crossing.\n\n          Let me compute the orientation:\n\n            For segment1 and segment2:\n\n            A=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(2,0), D=(0,3)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = (Bx-Ax)*(Cy-Ay) - (By-Ay)*(Cx-Ax) = (-2-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (-2)* (3-0) - (1)*(0-0) = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6\n\n            Then o1 * o2 = (-2)*(-6) = 12 > 0 -> not opposite.\n\n            Then we check segment1 and segment3? or segment2 and segment3?\n\n            Actually, we must check every pair. But note: the example says it is possible. So we must have at least one permutation that works.\n\n          What if we assign differently?\n\n          The example says \"in order\", meaning:\n\n            spaceship0 -> base0\n            spaceship1 -> base1\n            spaceship2 -> base2\n\n          But wait, the example input for bases is:\n\n            -2 1\n            0 3\n            2 2\n\n          So that is the order.\n\n          However, let me check the example matching they provided in the example: \n\n          The example says: \"For the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.\"\n\n          So the matching is:\n\n            (0,0) -> (-2,1)\n            (2,0) -> (0,3)\n            (3,1) -> (2,2)\n\n          Now, check if (0,0)->(-2,1) and (2,0)->(0,3) intersect:\n\n          We did: no.\n\n          Now, check (0,0)->(-2,1) and (3,1)->(2,2):\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n          Segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n          o1 = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (3,1)) = (-2-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) = (-2)*(1) - 1*(3) = -2-3 = -5\n          o2 = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (2,2)) = (-2)*(2) - 1*(2) = -4 - 2 = -6\n          Then o1 * o2 = (-5)*(-6) = 30 > 0 -> not opposite.\n\n          Then check (2,0)->(0,3) and (3,1)->(2,2):\n\n          Segment2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n          Segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n          o1 = orientation((2,0),(0,3),(3,1)) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) = (-2)*(1) - 3*(1) = -2-3 = -5\n          o2 = orientation((2,0),(0,3),(2,2)) = (-2)*(2) - 3*(0) = -4\n          o1 * o2 = (-5)*(-4)=20>0\n\n          So no intersections. Therefore, the matching is valid.\n\n          But wait, how did I know the example uses the bases in the given order? The example says \"connect the Rebels and bases in order\", meaning the first base to the first rebel, etc.\n\n          So the assignment is: \n            Rebel0 (first) -> Base0 (first)\n            Rebel1 (second) -> Base1 (second)\n            Rebel2 (third) -> Base2 (third)\n\n          Therefore, our permutation is the identity permutation.\n\n          However, note: the example input has 3 spaceships and 3 bases, and we read the bases in the given order.\n\n      Step 18: But wait, the example input is:\n\n          \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n          So the bases are: [-2,1], [0,3], [2,2]. The identity permutation is:\n\n            spaceship0 -> base0: (-2,1)\n            spaceship1 -> base1: (0,3)\n            spaceship2 -> base2: (2,2)\n\n          And we just checked that the identity permutation works.\n\n      Step 19: However, what if we have a different matching? We must check all permutations. But note: the problem does not specify which base goes to which, so we must consider all.\n\n      Step 20: But note: the example input has 3 bases and 3 spaceships. The example output is 'Yes'. So we must find at least one.\n\n      Step 21: But wait: what if the identity permutation doesn't work, but another does? Then we must continue until we find one.\n\n      Step 22: However, the example identity permutation worked.\n\n      Step 23: Now, consider the second example:\n\n          Input: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n          Here, R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so we output 'No'. But wait, the example output is 'No'. So that matches.\n\n      Step 24: But wait, the example input format is given as two strings in a list: \n          ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n          The second example is: \n            R=2, B=1 -> so we output 'No'.\n\n      Step 25: However, the example input string for the second example is:\n\n          \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n          This means: \n            First line: \"2 1\"\n            Then two lines for spaceships: \"1 0\", \"2 2\"\n            Then one line for bases: \"3 1\"\n\n          So we have 2 spaceships and 1 base. Then we output 'No' because R != B.\n\n      Step 26: But wait, the example output is 'No'. So that is correct.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the first line contains two integers R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n      Step 27: But what if R = B but the matching is impossible due to the geometric constraints? Then we must output 'No'.\n\n      Step 28: Let me test with a simple example that should be 'No':\n\n          Example: \n            R=1, B=1: always yes.\n\n          Example: \n            R=2, B=2: two spaceships and two bases.\n\n          Let the spaceships be at (0,0) and (0,1).\n          Let the bases be at (1,0) and (1,1).\n\n          Then the two matchings:\n\n          Matching1: (0,0)->(1,0) and (0,1)->(1,1): two vertical lines -> do not intersect -> valid.\n\n          Matching2: (0,0)->(1,1) and (0,1)->(1,0): the two segments cross at (0.5,0.5) -> invalid.\n\n          So we must find at least one valid matching. In this case, the identity matching is valid.\n\n          But note: the identity matching is: \n            spaceship0 (0,0) -> base0 (1,0)\n            spaceship1 (0,1) -> base1 (1,1)\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          Now, if we swap the bases, then we get the invalid matching.\n\n          Therefore, we must try all permutations.\n\n      Step 29: Another example that should be 'No':\n\n          Two spaceships and two bases, but the bases are (1,0) and (0,1). \n\n          Matching1: (0,0)->(1,0) and (0,1)->(0,1): \n            The segment from (0,0) to (1,0) and (0,1) to (0,1) is a point? Actually, wait: base1 is (0,1) and spaceship1 is (0,1) -> but the problem says \"no two points coincide\", so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n          Actually, the example: spaceships (0,0) and (0,1), bases (1,0) and (0,1). \n\n          Matching1: (0,0) to (1,0) and (0,1) to (0,1) is invalid because (0,1) is a base and also a spaceship? But the problem says \"no two points coincide\", so the set of all points (spaceships and bases) are distinct. So (0,1) is used for both? Actually, no: the spaceship (0,1) and base (0,1) are the same point. But the problem says \"no two points coincide\", so this situation is avoided.\n\n          So we assume all points are distinct.\n\n      Step 30: Another example: two spaceships and two bases, with bases (1,1) and (2,2). \n\n          Matching1: (0,0)->(1,1) and (0,1)->(2,2): two diagonal lines. They intersect if the lines cross. The first segment goes from (0,0) to (1,1) and the second from (0,1) to (2,2). \n\n          Check: \n            Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n            Segment2: (0,1) to (2,2)\n\n          The line equations: y=x and y=x+1? Actually, the second line: from (0,1) to (2,2): slope = (2-1)/(2-0)=1/2, so y = (1/2)x + 1.\n\n          The first line: y=x.\n\n          Intersection: x = (1/2)x + 1 -> (1/2)x = 1 -> x=2, but then y=2. But the second segment goes from (0,1) to (2,2) and the first segment from (0,0) to (1,1). The intersection at (2,2) is the endpoint of the second segment and the first segment only goes to (1,1). So the intersection is not in the interior.\n\n          However, note: the segments are defined by their endpoints. The condition is that the two straight paths (the segments) do not intersect. The definition typically requires that the segments do not share any interior points. The endpoints are distinct, but note: the endpoints are the spaceships and bases. The two segments share an endpoint? No, because the endpoints are distinct: the first segment ends at (1,1) and the second starts at (0,1) and goes to (2,2). They do not share an endpoint.\n\n          But wait: the bases are (1,1) and (2,2). The first spaceship is (0,0) and the second (0,1). \n\n          The matching is: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,1) to (2,2). These two segments do not share any point? \n\n          Actually, they do not. So the matching is valid.\n\n          Now, the other matching: (0,0) to (2,2) and (0,1) to (1,1). \n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2) -> equation y=x.\n          Segment2: (0,1) to (1,1) -> equation y=1.\n\n          They intersect at (1,1). But (1,1) is an endpoint of segment2 and is not an endpoint of segment1? Actually, (1,1) is the base for the second spaceship. The first segment goes from (0,0) to (2,2) and passes through (1,1). So the segment1 passes through the base (1,1) which is an endpoint of segment2. \n\n          However, the condition says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". \n\n          The base (1,1) is the endpoint of segment2, and the spaceship (0,0) is the start of segment1. The segment1 goes from (0,0) to (2,2) and passes through (1,1). So the two segments share the point (1,1). \n\n          But note: the problem says \"do not intersect\". Typically, in computational geometry, we consider that two segments can share an endpoint and that is allowed? Or not?\n\n          Let me re-read: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\"\n\n          The paths are from a base to its spaceship and from another base to its spaceship. The endpoints are distinct. However, the condition does not explicitly say whether endpoints can meet or not.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"in the galaxy plane\" and \"straight paths\". If two paths share an endpoint, then they meet at that point. \n\n          However, the endpoints are distinct: the bases and spaceships are distinct sets? The problem does not say they are disjoint. But the input guarantee: \"no two points coincide\", meaning no two points (whether spaceship or base) are the same. \n\n          So the endpoints of the segments are distinct. Therefore, the segments cannot share an endpoint because that would require that a base and a spaceship are the same, which is forbidden.\n\n          But wait, in the matching, the endpoints are: \n            Segment1: from base B1 to spaceship S1.\n            Segment2: from base B2 to spaceship S2.\n\n          The endpoints are: B1, S1, B2, S2. Since all points are distinct, the segments do not share any endpoint.\n\n          Therefore, the intersection must be an interior point.\n\n          So the condition is that the segments do not intersect at all (even at endpoints is not allowed? but endpoints are distinct so they don't share endpoints). \n\n          However, in the above example, the two segments (0,0)->(2,2) and (0,1)->(1,1) share the point (1,1) which is an endpoint of the second segment. But (1,1) is not an endpoint of the first segment? Actually, the first segment goes from (0,0) to (2,2) and (1,1) is an interior point of that segment? \n\n          Wait: (1,1) is the midpoint? Actually, the segment from (0,0) to (2,2) includes (1,1). But (1,1) is also a base (so an endpoint of the second segment). \n\n          Therefore, the two segments share the point (1,1). \n\n          According to the problem, the base (1,1) is assigned to the second spaceship (0,1). The first segment goes from (0,0) (a spaceship) to (2,2) (a base) and passes through (1,1) (another base). \n\n          The condition says: the paths (the straight segments) must not intersect. The intersection at (1,1) is an interior point of the first segment and an endpoint of the second. \n\n          So they do intersect.\n\n          Therefore, the matching that uses (0,0)->(2,2) and (0,1)->(1,1) is invalid.\n\n          But the other matching (0,0)->(1,1) and (0,1)->(2,2) is valid.\n\n          Therefore, we must output 'Yes' for this example.\n\n      Step 31: Therefore, we must check for any two segments sharing even a single point (interior or endpoint) and reject.\n\n      However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\", and the endpoints are distinct. But two segments might share an endpoint if the same point is used twice? But the problem says \"no two points coincide\", so no.\n\n      Actually, the endpoints of the segments are distinct. Therefore, two segments can only share an endpoint if they are the same segment? But we have distinct segments. \n\n      But wait: the endpoints are distinct, but two segments might share an endpoint if the same base is assigned twice? No, because we are doing a perfect matching (each base used once). Similarly for spaceships.\n\n      Therefore, the segments are defined by distinct endpoints. However, the entire set of points (spaceships and bases) are distinct, so the endpoints of the segments are distinct.\n\n      Then, two segments can only intersect at an interior point (not an endpoint) because the endpoints are unique.\n\n      But wait: the segment from (0,0) to (2,2) and the segment from (0,1) to (1,1) share the point (1,1). However, (1,1) is an endpoint of the second segment and an interior point of the first segment. \n\n      This is an intersection.\n\n      Therefore, our orientation method must detect this.\n\n      Let me check with the orientation method:\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n          Segment2: (0,1) to (1,1)\n\n          Check segment1 and segment2:\n\n          A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(0,1), D=(1,1)\n\n          o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = (2-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*1 - 2*0 = 2\n          o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (2)*(1-0) - (2)*(1-0) = 2*1 - 2*1 = 0\n\n          o1 * o2 = 0 -> not negative, so condition fails.\n\n          But wait, the condition is that the orientations must be opposite. However, one of them is zero. \n\n          The condition we used: (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0) fails because one of the products is zero.\n\n          How do we handle when a point is collinear? The problem says no three points are collinear. So this should not occur.\n\n          But wait, in our example, the three points (0,0), (2,2), (1,1) are collinear. So the condition is violated? \n\n          However, the problem says \"no three points are on the same line\". \n\n          So we are guaranteed that no three points are collinear. Therefore, the example I constructed is invalid because the bases and spaceships must not have three collinear points.\n\n          Therefore, we don't have to worry about zero in the orientation.\n\n      Step 32: So the algorithm:\n\n          If R != B: print('No')\n          Else if R == 0: print('Yes')\n          Else:\n            Read the points.\n\n            Define the orientation function.\n\n            Define the segments_intersect function (using the four orientation products, and we know no three points are collinear, so no zeros).\n\n            Generate all permutations of the bases (of length R).\n\n            For each permutation p:\n\n                Build the list of segments: for i in range(R): (spaceships[i], bases_perm[i])\n\n                For each pair of distinct segments (i, j) (with i < j):\n\n                    if segments_intersect(segment[i], segment[j]): break inner loop and try next permutation.\n\n                If no intersection found, output 'Yes' and break.\n\n            If no permutation is valid, output 'No'\n\n      Step 33: However, note: the problem says \"no three points are on the same line\", so we don't have to worry about the orientation being zero.\n\n      Step 34: But wait, the bases and spaceships together: we are given R+B points, and the condition is that no three points (from the entire set) are collinear.\n\n      Step 35: We assume the input satisfies that.\n\n      Step 36: Code accordingly.\n\n      However, note: the example we just considered (with three collinear points) is not allowed by the input condition. So we are safe.\n\n      Let me test with the example that had two bases and two spaceships (with bases (1,1) and (2,2)) and spaceships (0,0) and (0,1)):\n\n          The entire set of points: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,2). \n\n          Check if any three are collinear:\n\n          (0,0), (0,1), (1,1): not collinear.\n          (0,0), (0,1), (2,2): not collinear.\n          (0,0), (1,1), (0,1): not collinear.\n          (0,0), (1,1), (2,2): collinear -> violates the condition.\n\n          Therefore, such input is not allowed.\n\n      Step 37: So the input condition saves us.\n\n      Step 38: But wait, what if the three collinear points are not including a base and a spaceship? Actually, the condition is \"no three points are on the same line\", meaning the entire set of R+B points.\n\n      Therefore, we are guaranteed that the input points are in general position (no three collinear).\n\n      Step 39: Therefore, we can safely use the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of base assignments to spaceships and verifying the geometric condition for non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (bijection) between R spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting segments intersect. Given the constraints (R and B are at most 10), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each permutation of base assignments, we need to ensure that no two segments cross. This involves checking the geometric intersection of all pairs of segments in the current permutation.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the orientation method to check segment intersections. The orientation of three points determines their relative positions (clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear). Two segments intersect if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: With R and B up to 10, there are R! permutations (up to 3,628,800). For each permutation, we check all pairs of segments (C(R,2) pairs), each requiring 4 orientation checks. This results in a manageable number of operations for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n    A, B = seg1\n    C, D = seg2\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print('No')\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    R = int(first_line[0])\n    B = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print('No')\n        return\n        \n    spaceships = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(R):\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        x = int(parts[0])\n        y = int(parts[1])\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        x = int(parts[0])\n        y = int(parts[1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R == 0:\n        print('Yes')\n        return\n        \n    perms = itertools.permutations(bases)\n    found = False\n    for perm in perms:\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            s = spaceships[i]\n            base_point = perm[i]\n            segments.append((s, base_point))\n            \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print('Yes' if found else 'No')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R ≠ B, it immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Spaceship and Base Coordinates**: The coordinates of the spaceships and bases are stored in lists.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of base assignments, the code constructs segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: Using the orientation method, the code checks if any two segments intersect. If no intersections are found for a permutation, it prints \"Yes\" and exits; otherwise, after checking all permutations, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments using combinatorial permutations and geometric intersection checks, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
