The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (odd/even) of the numbers because the condition is: \n a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2) which means one must be odd and the other even.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes: \n        odd_chests = number of chests with odd a_i\n        even_chests = number of chests with even a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n\n Now, note that an odd chest can only be opened by an even key, and an even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n\n So, if we let:\n   x = number of odd chests we open (each requires an even key)\n   y = number of even chests we open (each requires an odd key)\n\n Then, we have:\n   x <= min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n   y <= min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n\n But note: we cannot use the same key twice. However, the catch is that the total number of keys used for odd chests (even keys) is x, and for even chests (odd keys) is y, and these two sets of keys are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, we must have x + y <= min(odd_chests+even_chests, odd_keys+even_keys) but that is automatically satisfied by the above constraints? Actually, no, because the two sets of keys are independent.\n\n However, we have two independent bipartite graphs: one from odd_chests to even_keys and one from even_chests to odd_keys.\n\n The maximum matching in this case is limited by both the supply of even keys and odd keys, but also note that we cannot use the same key for two purposes.\n\n But observe: the two types of keys (even and odd) are distinct. Similarly for chests.\n\n However, the problem is that we have two separate conditions. We can open at most odd_chests (if we have enough even keys) and even_chests (if we have enough odd keys). But we are constrained by the available keys.\n\n Actually, we can think of it as two independent bipartite matchings:\n\n   Matching1: odd_chests to even_keys -> maximum matching is min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n   Matching2: even_chests to odd_keys -> maximum matching is min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n\n However, note that the total matching is the sum of these two? \n\n But wait: the keys are not shared between the two matchings. We are using even keys for odd_chests and odd keys for even_chests. Since the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, we can use all the even keys for odd_chests and all the odd keys for even_chests. There is no overlap in the keys.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply:\n   answer = min(odd_chests, even_keys) + min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd.\n        odd_chests = 2, even_chests = 3.\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even.\n        odd_keys = 1, even_keys = 3.\n\n   Then, \n        x = min(2, 3) = 2\n        y = min(3, 1) = 1\n        total = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10] (all even), keys = [5] (odd)\n        odd_chests = 0, even_chests = 5.\n        odd_keys = 1, even_keys = 0.\n        x = min(0,0)=0\n        y = min(5,1)=1\n        total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chest=[10] (even), keys=[20,30,40,50] (all even)\n        odd_chests=0, even_chests=1.\n        odd_keys=0, even_keys=4.\n        x = min(0,4)=0\n        y = min(1,0)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list of n integers for chests\n   Read list",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The condition for a valid match is that the chest's number and the key's number must have different parities (one even and one odd).\n2. **Intuition**: Separate the chests and keys into two categories based on their parity. Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys, and even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each category (odd chests with even keys and even chests with odd keys), the maximum number of matches is the minimum of the count of items in each category. The total number of chests opened is the sum of these two maxima.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves counting the number of odd and even values in both the chest and key lists, which can be done in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    odd_chests = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 != 0)\n    even_chests = n - odd_chests\n    \n    odd_keys = sum(1 for num in keys if num % 2 != 0)\n    even_keys = m - odd_keys\n    \n    ans = min(odd_chests, even_keys) + min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are odd or even. This helps in determining the valid pairs for opening chests.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the number of odd chests and even keys, and the minimum between the number of even chests and odd keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without any complex computations or algorithms, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
