There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament is arranged under a constraint: two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the constraint might force a structure that is not strictly by rounds.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players required for a winner to play k games.\n\n How do we build a tournament where the winner plays k games?\n\n Consider that the winner must win k consecutive games. Before the first game, the winner has 0 games. After the first win, 1; then 2, etc.\n\n Additionally, the rule requires that when the winner plays the (k)-th game, the opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k (but note: the opponent must have won all his games, so the number of games he has played is the number of wins). However, note that the winner is the only one that we care about for the maximum, and we want to maximize k (the number of games the winner plays).\n\n Actually, we can model the tournament as having two \"lanes\" or \"groups\" of players. The idea is that to have a player (the winner) play k games, we need to arrange the other players in such a way that the winner can face an opponent that has played at most one game less than the winner's previous games.\n\n Alternatively, consider:\n\n Let the winner play k games. Then, the tournament must have at least k rounds (each round the winner progresses). But note the constraint: the next opponent must have played at most one game less than the current number of games the winner has.\n\n However, we can also consider building the tournament from the perspective of the entire bracket. The winner must defeat k opponents. Each of these k opponents must have won some games before facing the winner.\n\n In fact, we can use the following recursive structure:\n\n - To have a match where the winner (who has played r games) plays against an opponent (who has played s games), we require |r - s| <= 1.\n\n How many players are needed to set up the conditions for the winner to play k games?\n\n We can break down the tournament into two parts: the part that leads to the winner and the rest. But note that the winner must go through k matches.\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\n How do we form a tournament where the winner plays k games?\n\n - In the last (k-th) game, the winner must face an opponent. For this opponent to be available, he must have come from a subtree that allows him to have exactly k-1 games (if the winner had k-1 games) or k-2? Actually, the rule says the difference must be at most 1. So the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 (since the winner has k-1 games just before the k-th).\n\n However, note that the winner's k-th game: the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1. But wait, the winner has played k-1 games so far. Therefore, the opponent must have played at least k-2 and at most k-1.\n\n Now, to get an opponent with exactly k-1 games, we need a branch that has a winner playing k-1 games. Similarly, to get an opponent with k-2 games, we need a branch that has a winner playing k-2 games.\n\n But note: the entire opponent's path must be independent. So the minimal number of players required to produce an opponent that has played k-1 games is F(k-1). Similarly, to produce an opponent that has played k-2 games is F(k-2). However, we don't necessarily need both. We can choose the opponent from one of the two possibilities.\n\n Actually, to set up the k-th game, we need one opponent. This opponent can come from:\n\n Option 1: A subtree that produces a winner (for that subtree) with k-1 games. Then the opponent has k-1 games, which is allowed (difference 0) because the winner has k-1 too (before the k-th game, the winner has k-1). Then the entire tournament would have the winner plus the entire subtree for the opponent (which has F(k-1) players) and the rest of the tournament? But note: we are only concerned with the minimal number of players to allow the winner to play k games.\n\n However, the entire tournament must be set so that the winner is the overall champion. The winner must beat k opponents. Each of these k opponents must be the champions of their own subtrees.\n\n But note: the constraint applies to every game. Also, we are allowed to have more than just the necessary players for the winner's path? Actually, we are to find the maximum k (number of games) for a given n (players). So we need to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n How to compute F(k)? \n\n Base cases:\n   k = 0: 0 players? Not really. But if the winner hasn't played any game, then we are at the beginning. Actually, we can define:\n   F(0) = 1? No, because if there are 0 players then we cannot have a tournament. But the winner must exist. Let's define:\n\n   F(1): the minimal number of players to have the winner play 1 game.\n        We need two players: the winner and one opponent. Then the tournament has 2 players -> 1 game. So F(1) = 2.\n\n   F(2): the winner must play 2 games. \n        In the first game, the winner (with 0 games) plays an opponent (with 0 games). Then the winner wins and now has 1 game.\n        In the second game, the winner must play an opponent that has either 0 or 1 game. But wait, if we use the same opponent again? Actually, no: the opponent must be someone else. \n\n        Alternatively, we can have:\n          First, two games: one between the winner and opponent1, and then the winner and opponent2. But wait, after the first game the winner has 1 game, and the second game requires an opponent that has at most 1 game. However, the opponent for the second game must be a player that did not lose the first game (so we have to consider the entire bracket).\n\n        Actually, the minimal setup for the winner to play 2 games is:\n\n        We have three players: \n          Game1: winner vs player1 -> winner wins (now winner has 1 game)\n          Game2: winner vs player2 -> winner wins\n\n        But wait, the rule says the two players can play only if the difference is at most 1. In the second game, the winner has 1 game and the new opponent (player2) has 0 games. That is a difference of 1 -> allowed.\n\n        However, is there a way with 2 players? With 2 players, the winner plays one game. So we need at least 3 players for 2 games.\n\n        But wait, let me check: with 3 players, we can have:\n          First, we must have two games? Actually, no. In a knockout tournament with 3 players, we can have:\n          Option: \n            First game: player1 vs player2 -> say player1 wins.\n            Then second game: player1 (winner) vs player3.\n\n          So the winner (player1) has played 2 games. Therefore, with 3 players, the winner can play 2 games.\n\n        However, note that the tournament grid is fixed arbitrarily. But the problem does not specify the exact grid, only the rule. And we are to maximize the number of games the winner can have.\n\n        So F(2) = 3.\n\n        Now, for k=3:\n\n        The winner must play 3 games. The third game: the opponent must have either 1 or 2 games.\n\n        We can set up:\n\n          We need at least one opponent with 2 games (so that the winner with 2 games can face an opponent with 2 games) OR one with 1 game (then the winner has 2 and the opponent 1, which is a difference of 1).\n\n        But to have an opponent with 2 games, we need a subtree that requires F(2) = 3 players (as above). Then we can have:\n\n          Total players = 1 (the winner) + the entire subtree for the opponent (3 players) and then the other games? Actually, we need to account for the fact that the opponent in the third game must be the winner of a subtree that has 3 players (so that he has 2 wins). Then the entire tournament must include:\n\n          - The winner (1)\n          - The subtree for the opponent (3 players) -> but wait, the winner of that subtree is the opponent, and the other two players are eliminated.\n\n          However, we also need to account for the two previous opponents? Actually, no: the two previous opponents are in the winner's path and the opponent for the third game is from a different branch.\n\n          So the entire set of players is:\n            The winner (1)\n            The two opponents that the winner beat in the first two games (2 players)\n            The subtree for the third opponent (which is a tournament of 3 players, but note: the third opponent is the winner of that subtree, so we count the entire subtree: 3 players)\n\n          But wait, the two opponents that the winner beat in the first two games are distinct from the third opponent's subtree? Yes.\n\n          However, we can reuse the same players? No, because once a player loses they leave.\n\n          So the minimal number of players for k=3 is 1 (the winner) + 2 (the two direct opponents) + 3 (the subtree for the third opponent) = 6.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to use an opponent that has 1 game (difference 1). Then we need a subtree that produces an opponent with 1 game. The minimal number of players for an opponent to have 1 game is 2 (the opponent and one other). Then:\n\n          Total players = 1 (the winner) + 2 (the two direct opponents) + 2 (the subtree for the third opponent) = 5.\n\n        But wait, in the second game the winner beats one of the two direct opponents, and then the third game is against the opponent from the subtree of 2 players. However, the two direct opponents are the ones the winner faced in the first two games? Actually, the two direct opponents are the ones that the winner faced in the first two games, and the third opponent is from a separate branch.\n\n        However, note that the first two games: the winner must have two wins. The two direct opponents are two distinct players. Then the third game: the opponent must be a player that has not been eliminated and has at most one game. But how did that third opponent get one game? He must have won a game. That game must have been against someone else. So the third opponent's win is against one of the remaining players (or maybe one of the two direct opponents?).\n\n        Actually, we cannot use the direct opponents again because they are already eliminated. So the third opponent must come from a different set.\n\n        Now, what if we arrange the tournament as follows (with 5 players):\n\n          Let the players be: W (winner), A, B, C, D.\n\n          We need to have W play two games and then one more.\n\n          One possible arrangement:\n\n          Round1: \n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W has 1 game)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B has 1 game)\n\n          Then, we have two winners: W and B.\n\n          Now, we have to arrange the next round. But the rule: W (with 1 game) can play against B (with 1 game) or someone with 0 or 2 games? But we have D (who hasn't played) and B (with 1 game). \n\n          Then Round2:\n            Game3: W vs B -> W wins (W has 2 games)\n            Now, we have two players left: D (0 games) and ... but wait, we have only one game left? Actually, we have two winners: W and the winner of the next round? \n\n          But wait, we haven't used D. Actually, we have two winners from the first round (W and B) and D is still there. Then we have to have another game? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A out)\n            Game2: B vs D -> B wins (B:1, D out)\n\n          Then Round2:\n            Game3: W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B out)\n\n          Then we have only one player left? No, we started with 5: W, A, B, C, D. Wait, I missed C.\n\n          Actually, we have 5 players. We must have 4 games in total (since 5-1=4). But the winner must play 3 games. So we need 3 wins for the winner.\n\n          Let me try:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B:1)\n            Game3: D must play someone? But we have two winners (W and B) and one loser (the loser of B vs C, say C). But we have 5 players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          Round1: \n            W vs A -> W wins\n            B vs C -> B wins\n            Then we have three players left: W, B, D.\n\n          Round2:\n            Game3: W vs B -> W wins (now W has 2 games)\n            Then we have two players: W and D.\n\n          Round3:\n            Game4: W vs D -> W wins (W has 3 games)\n\n          Now, the rule for the third game (W vs D): W has 2 games, D has 0 games -> difference 2, which is not allowed.\n\n          So we cannot do that.\n\n        Therefore, to have the third game, the opponent D must have played at least 1 game? But D hasn't played any. So we need to set up D to have played one game.\n\n        How? We can have:\n\n          Round1:\n            W vs A -> W wins (W:1)\n            B vs C -> B wins (B:1)\n            Then we have three players: W, B, D.\n\n          But we cannot have a third game in round1 because we have an odd number of remaining players. Actually, we can't split three players arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          Round1: \n            W vs A -> W wins (W:1)\n            B vs C -> B wins (B:1)\n            Then we have to have a third game in round1? But we have three players: W, B, D. We cannot have three games in round1 because we started with 5 and we remove two in the first two games, leaving three. Then we must have two more rounds, but the second round would have two games (because we have three players: we can have one game and then the next round?).\n\n        Actually, we can change the structure. The rule doesn't specify rounds, only that the two players must have at most one game difference.\n\n        Another approach: we can use a recursive formula.\n\n        Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\n        In the k-th game, the winner (with k-1 wins) must play an opponent that has either k-2 or k-1 wins.\n\n        The opponent with k-1 wins would have come from a subtree of F(k-1) players (because that subtree requires F(k-1) players to have its winner play k-1 games). Similarly, the opponent with k-2 wins comes from a subtree of F(k-2) players.\n\n        However, the entire tournament must include:\n          - The winner (1 player)\n          - The two opponents (the one from the k-1 subtree and the one from the k-2 subtree?) Actually, no: the entire tournament is built from the winner and the two subtrees (one for the k-1 opponent and one for the k-2 opponent) but wait, we only need one opponent for the k-th game.\n\n        But note: the winner must have beaten two opponents in the previous two games. These two opponents must have come from two different subtrees (each of size F(1) and F(0))? Actually, the first two games:\n\n        - First game: the winner (0 wins) vs an opponent (0 wins) -> that opponent must be from a subtree of size F(0). What is F(0)? Maybe 1 (only the opponent, and no one else, because the opponent didn't win any game). Then the first game requires 1 (the winner) + 1 (the opponent) = 2 players, but wait, the winner is already counted separately.\n\n        Actually, let's define F(k) as the minimal number of players in the entire tournament (excluding the winner? Or including?) \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: to have the winner play k games, we need:\n\n          The winner must defeat k opponents.\n\n          The i-th opponent (for i from 1 to k) must be the winner of a subtree that has a certain number of players.\n\n        Moreover, the constraint on the number of games the opponent has is that the opponent must have a number of games (wins) that is either k-i (if we consider that the winner has i-1 wins at the time of the i-th game) but wait, actually the i-th game is the winner's i-th win, so the opponent must have at least i-2 wins (if i>=2) and at most i-1 wins? \n\n        Actually, at the i-th game, the winner has i-1 wins, so the opponent must have between i-2 and i-1 wins.\n\n        Now, to have an opponent with j wins, we need a subtree that is designed to give j wins to its winner, and that subtree requires F(j) players.\n\n        But note: the entire tournament must have the winner and the two subtrees (for the two opponents) and so on? Actually, the entire tournament is built by having the winner and the two subtrees for the two opponents in the last two games, and then recursively.\n\n        However, the entire tournament is the winner plus the two subtrees (from the last two games) and the subtrees themselves may contain their own subtrees.\n\n        But wait, the minimal way is to have the two opponents for the last two games (the k-th and the (k-1)-th) and then the two opponents for those, etc.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          F(0) = 1   [a dummy value: no wins, so the player is not the winner? Or we don't use it?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n          F(1) = 2   [the winner and one opponent]\n          F(2) = 3   [the winner and two opponents (one for the first game and one for the second) but note: the second game's opponent must have 0 or 1. However, the minimal way is to have two opponents: one for the first and one for the second. But wait, the first opponent is just one player, and the second opponent must be one player. But then we have 3 players total: the winner, the first opponent, and the second opponent. However, the second opponent hasn't played any game until the second round? Then the rule: the winner has 1 game, the second opponent has 0 -> allowed.\n\n        But wait, in the second game, the second opponent must have played at most one game. He hasn't played any, so that's okay.\n\n        Now, for k=3:\n\n          The winner must have three wins. The third game: the opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins.\n\n          If we use an opponent with 2 wins, then we need a subtree of F(2)=3 players (which gives an opponent with 2 wins). Then the entire tournament would be:\n\n            Winner: 1\n            Opponent for the third game: the winner of a 3-player tournament (which is 3 players)\n            Then the two opponents for the first two games: each is one player (so 2 players)\n\n            Total: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.\n\n          Alternatively, if we use an opponent with 1 win, then we need a subtree of F(1)=2 players (to produce an opponent with 1 win). Then:\n\n            Winner: 1\n            Opponent for the third game: 2 players\n            Two opponents for the first two games: 2 players\n\n            Total: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n          But wait, is 5 valid? We need to check the entire progression.\n\n          Let the players be: W (winner), A, B, C, D.\n\n          We need W to play three games.\n\n          The first two games: W must defeat two opponents (say A and B). But wait, the two opponents for the first two games are distinct, so that's two players.\n\n          Then the third game: W must defeat an opponent (say C) who has 1 win. How did C get 1 win? Because C must have defeated D.\n\n          So the bracket:\n\n          Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0) -> but wait, the rule for the first game: both have 0 -> allowed.\n          Game2: B vs D -> B wins (B:1, D:0) -> then we have the following: W and B are the winners of their respective two-player subtrees.\n\n          Now, the third game: W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:0) -> wait, but B has 1 win (from defeating D) and W has 2 wins (from two wins) at the start of the third game? Actually, no: the third game is the third game for W, but for B, the game against W is the second game for B.\n\n          However, the rule: the two players (W and B) must have at most one difference in the number of games they've played. At the moment of the third game, W has 2 games and B has 1 game. That's a difference of 1 -> allowed.\n\n          Then W wins, and becomes the champion with 3 wins.\n\n          But wait, the entire tournament has 5 players: W, A, B, C, D. However, in the above we used A, B, D, and then C was never used? Actually, I think I mixed up the labels.\n\n          Let me label properly:\n\n          Players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n          We need to have:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B:1)   [then we have two winners: W and B, and one eliminated: A and C? Actually, we have eliminated A and C, and we have B and D left? Or did I forget D?]\n\n          Actually, we have 5 players. We need to set up the third game.\n\n          The correct setup:\n\n          We need two opponents for the first two games (A and B) and then the third opponent (C) must have one win, so C must have defeated D.\n\n          So:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (eliminate A)\n            Game2: B vs D -> B wins (eliminate D)   [wait, then we have W and B, and then we have C left? But then we cannot have a third game because we have two players (W and B) and one player (C) is not eliminated? Actually, we have to eliminate until we have the champion.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins\n            Game3: D is waiting? Then we have two winners: W and B, and one loser (the one eliminated in the first two games) and D remains.\n\n          Then we need a second round:\n\n          Round2:\n            Game3: W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:1) -> now we have W and D left?\n            Then we have to have a third round for W and D? But that would be the third game for W, and D has 0 games -> difference 2, which is not allowed.\n\n          So we must set up D to have a game.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins\n            Game3: D must be paired? But we have three winners? Actually, we have three players: W, B, D.\n\n          Then Round2:\n            Game3: W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:1)\n            Then we have two players: W and D.\n\n          Then Round3: W vs D -> W wins (W:3, D:0) -> not allowed.\n\n          So we need to have D win a game. Then we must have a fourth player (E) for D to defeat? But we only have 5 players.\n\n          Actually, we have 5 players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n          We must have:\n\n          Round1: \n            W vs A -> W wins\n            B vs C -> B wins\n            Then we have three players: W, B, D.\n\n          Then we can have:\n\n          Round2:\n            W vs D -> W wins (if we allow that) then W has 2 wins, and B is still with 1 win. Then we have two players: W and B, and then Round3: W vs B -> W wins (third win).\n\n          Now, check the rules:\n\n          Round2: W vs D: \n            W has 1 win (from Round1) and D has 0 wins -> allowed.\n\n          Round3: W vs B:\n            W has 2 wins, B has 1 win -> allowed.\n\n          So the entire tournament:\n\n            Players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n            Round1: \n                W beats A (W:1, A:0)\n                B beats C (B:1, C:0)\n\n            Round2:\n                W beats D (W:2, D:0)   [allowed because |2-0|=2? -> wait, no! the rule says the difference must be at most 1. So 2 and 0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed.\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n          Let me try a different pairing:\n\n          We need the third opponent (D) to have one win. So D must have beaten someone. The only possibility is that D beats one of the initial opponents? But the initial opponents (A and C) are already eliminated.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have a three-player subtree for the third opponent? Then we would need more players.\n\n          Actually, to have the third opponent (D) have one win, we need D to have beaten one player. But which player? We cannot use A or C because they are already eliminated in the first round.\n\n          Then we must have a second round for D? But then we need to have D play a game in the first round? \n\n          Let me restructure the entire tournament:\n\n          We have five players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n          We need W to play three games, and the third opponent must have at least one win.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1)\n            Game2: B vs C -> B wins (B:1)\n            Game3: D vs ??? -> but we have no one else.\n\n          This doesn't work because we have an odd number.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs B -> W wins (W:1)\n            Game2: A vs C -> A wins (A:1)\n            Then we have three players: W, A, D.\n\n          Round2:\n            Game2: W vs A -> W wins (W:2, A:1)   [allowed: difference 1]\n            Then we have two players: W and D.\n\n          Round3: W vs D -> W wins (W:3, D:0) -> not allowed.\n\n          Or:\n\n          Round1:\n            Game1: W vs B -> W wins (W:1)\n            Game2: A vs D -> A wins (A:1)\n            Then we have three players: W, A, C.\n\n          Round2:\n            Game2: W vs A -> W wins (W:2, A:1)   [allowed]\n            Game3: C is left? Then we have two players: W and C.\n\n          Round3: W vs C -> W wins (W:3, C:0) -> not allowed.\n\n          So it seems that with 5 players we cannot have the third game without violating the rule.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of players for k=3 is 6.\n\n        How about a general recurrence?\n\n        It appears that:\n\n          F(1) = 2\n          F(2) = 3\n          F(3) = 7? Or 6? We saw that 5 is not enough, so 6 is minimal.\n\n        Let me try to build a tournament for k=3 with 6 players.\n\n        Players: W, A, B, C, D, E.\n\n        We need W to play three games, and the third opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins.\n\n        Let's use the opponent with 2 wins (so we need a subtree of 3 players to produce an opponent with 2 wins). Then the two previous opponents (for the first two games) must be two more players.\n\n        But wait, the two previous opponents are part of the entire tournament? Actually, the entire tournament is:\n\n          The winner W.\n          The two opponents for the first two games: say A and B.\n          The subtree for the third opponent (which is a 3-player tournament) that produces a player (say E) with 2 wins.\n\n        Then the total players: 1 (W) + 2 (A and B) + 3 (the subtree) = 6.\n\n        Now, the bracket:\n\n          First, we must arrange the 3-player subtree (players E, D, and C) to produce E with 2 wins.\n\n          How to arrange the 3-player subtree (E, D, C) to have E win 2 games?\n\n          In the subtree:\n\n            Game1: E vs D -> E wins (E:1, D:0)\n            Game2: E vs C -> E wins (E:2, C:0)\n\n          Then the entire tournament:\n\n            We have six players: W, A, B, E, D, C.\n\n            But wait, we have two separate tournaments: one for the first two games (W, A, B) and one for the last game (E, D, C). Then we have to combine them.\n\n            Actually, we have to interleave the games so that the rule is satisfied at every game.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Round1:\n              Game1: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n              Game2: B vs D -> B wins (B:1, D:0)   [But wait, we need the subtree for E: the subtree is E, D, C. We haven't used E in the first round?]\n\n            This is getting messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a recurrence:\n\n          Let F(0) = 1 (representing a leaf node? or base case)\n          Then F(1) = F(0) + 1   [the winner and the opponent from F(0)]\n          F(2) = F(1) + F(0)   [the winner and the two opponents: one from F(1) and one from F(0)] -> but wait, we need two opponents for two games.\n\n        Actually, a known similar problem: the maximal number of wins for the champion in a single elimination tournament with n players, under the condition that the bracket is balanced (like a complete binary tree). But here the constraint is more general.\n\n        After reading discussions of similar problems (like CodeForces), we can derive:\n\n          Let k be the number of wins (games) for the champion.\n\n          Then the minimal number of players required is:\n\n            F(k) = 2^(k) - 1   [if we were building a complete binary tree?] but that doesn't fit our numbers.\n\n          Our numbers: \n            k=1 -> 2\n            k=2 -> 3\n            k=3 -> 6 (we think) or 7?\n\n        Another known result: the maximal number of wins for the champion is floor(log2(n)) + 1? But that is not matching.\n\n        Actually, after reading the example outputs:\n\n          Input: ['2','3','4','10'] -> Output: ['1','2','2','4']\n\n          For n=2 -> answer=1\n          For n=3 -> answer=2\n          For n=4 -> answer=2\n          For n=10 -> answer=4\n\n        How is that computed?\n\n        We are to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        We have:\n\n          k=0: F(0)=1\n          k=1: F(1)=2\n          k=2: F(2)=3\n          k=3: F(3)=?  (at least 6, but the example n=10 gives k=4, so F(4) must be <=10)\n\n        Let me compute F(k) by a recurrence:\n\n        We know that to have the winner play k games, we need:\n\n          The last game: the winner (with k-1 wins) must face an opponent with either k-2 or k-1 wins.\n\n          The minimal number of players is achieved when we choose the option that minimizes the total.\n\n          However, the entire tournament must include:\n\n            The winner (1 player)\n            The two opponents from the previous two games (each requiring a minimal subtree) and so on.\n\n        Actually, we can use a recurrence that considers the two possibilities for the last game and takes the minimum of the two, but then we are minimizing the number of players for a fixed k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n        Why?\n\n          To have a tournament where the winner plays k games, we can have:\n\n          - The winner plays the first k-1 games in a tournament that requires F(k-1) players (including the winner) and then the k-th game against an opponent that comes from a tournament of F(k-2) players.\n\n          But wait, the entire tournament would then be F(k-1) + F(k-2) - 1 (because the winner is counted twice).\n\n        However, let me test:\n\n          F(0) = 1 (base: no wins, just the player himself? Or base cases:)\n\n        We can define:\n\n          F(0) = 1   [0 wins: the player has 0 wins, so no games played. This is the minimal tournament for 0 wins: just the player? But the tournament must have at least one player?]\n\n          Then:\n            F(1) = F(0) + F(-1) -> not defined.\n\n        Let me redefine with base cases:\n\n          F(1) = 1 (opponent) + 1 (the winner) ? -> but the entire tournament has 2 players.\n\n        Actually, let me define F(k) as the minimal number of players in the entire tournament (including the winner) for the winner to play k games.\n\n        Then:\n\n          For k=0: F(0)=1 (the winner has 0 games, so no games played, but he is present) -> but then the tournament has one player and zero games.\n\n          For k=1: F(1)=2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\n          For k=2: F(2)= F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3 -> matches.\n\n          For k=3: F(3)= F(2) + F(1) = 3+2 = 5 -> but we thought 5 didn't work.\n\n        But wait, our earlier attempt with 5 players didn't work. However, the recurrence F(k)=F(k-1)+F(k-2) is the recurrence for the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n          F(0)=1\n          F(1)=2\n          F(2)=3\n          F(3)=F(2)+F(1)=3+2=5\n          F(4)=F(3)+F(2)=5+3=8\n          F(5)=F(4)+F(3)=8+5=13\n\n        Now, the example input n=10 -> the maximum k such that F(k)<=10.\n\n          k=0: 1<=10 -> yes\n          k=1: 2<=10 -> yes\n          k=2: 3<=10 -> yes\n          k=3: 5<=10 -> yes\n          k=4: 8<=10 -> yes\n          k=5: 13>10 -> no\n\n        So the answer for n=10 would be 4.\n\n        And the example output for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the winner must win all their games to be declared the champion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the tournament structure must adhere to the constraint that any two players competing must have a difference of at most one in their game counts. This resembles a binary tree structure where each level (game) requires players to have similar experience levels (number of wins).\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, `F(k)` (the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games) is defined as:\n   - `F(0) = 1` (base case: no games played)\n   - `F(1) = 2` (one game requires two players)\n   - For `k >= 2`, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a recursive approach based on the Fibonacci sequence to compute the minimal number of players required for each possible number of games `k`. Given `n`, we find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. The time complexity is O(log k) due to the nature of the Fibonacci recurrence, which is optimal for large values of `n` (up to 10^18).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while b <= n:\n        next_val = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = next_val\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 2, the output is immediately 1 since the winner plays only one game.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing `F(0)` and `F(1)` respectively. The loop continues to compute subsequent Fibonacci numbers until `b` exceeds `n`.\n4. **Result Determination**: The loop exits when the next Fibonacci number would exceed `n`. The result is `k - 1`, where `k` is the count of valid Fibonacci numbers computed before exceeding `n`, giving the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution without explicitly constructing the tournament structure, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
