In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. Each string is of the form \"digit suit\", but note: the input is three separate strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" and each tile is represented by two characters.\n\n Actually, looking at the example input format, it might be that the input is given as one line with three space-separated two-character strings? Or maybe the entire input is three tokens (each token being a two-character string) separated by spaces?\n\n However, the example input is shown as:\n     Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the problem says \"The only line\" so we read one line. Then we have to split that line.\n\n Let me clarify: the example input has three examples, but the problem expects:\n\n Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n        Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n And each string is a tile? Or are there three tiles and they are separated by spaces?\n\n Wait, the example input is given as three separate strings, but the problem says \"three strings\". Each string is two characters. So the input might be:\n\n Example 1: \"1s2s3s\" ? But then how do we separate? \n\n Actually, the example input representation is ambiguous. Let me look again: \n\n Example input: \n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is likely a representation of three test cases. But the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is one line with three strings. \n\n Clarification from the problem statement: \n        The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n But wait, if we have three tiles, then we have three strings? Or each tile is represented by one string (which is two characters)? Then the input should be three two-character strings.\n\n However, the example input is shown as having spaces. The problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n So each tile is represented by a string of length 2. Then the input is one line with three such strings, separated by spaces.\n\n Example: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n Therefore, we can read the input line and split by space to get a list of three strings.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split to get three strings: [t1, t2, t3]\n\n 2. We have three tiles. We need to check if there is already a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) in the hand.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\", meaning that we need at least one mentsu (three tiles) in her hand.\n\n But note: after drawing, the hand may have more than three tiles. However, the condition is that she must have at least one mentsu (three tiles). \n\n Since we can draw any tile arbitrarily, including duplicates, we are allowed to form a mentsu even if we don't use all three original tiles.\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that the mentsu must be formed by the drawn tiles and the existing ones. It just says \"have at least one mentsu\".\n\n However, note: the hand initially has three tiles. We can draw extra tiles. We are to find the minimum number of draws so that there exists a set of three tiles (from the hand) that form a mentsu.\n\n But note: the definition of koutsu and shuntsu requires exactly three identical tiles or three consecutive tiles in the same suit.\n\n Important: the hand may have more than three tiles, but we are only concerned with the existence of a mentsu (a set of three).\n\n However, we are allowed to draw arbitrarily. The goal is to minimize the number of draws.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) -> 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: With 0 draws, no mentsu. Then we consider 1 draw: can we form a ments",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m]).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n   - The goal is to check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If not, determine the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form one.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, verify if any of the three tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu.\n   - **Single Draw Possibility**: If no mentsu exists, check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking if two tiles can be part of a potential triplet or sequence with a third tile.\n   - **Two Draws Required**: If forming a mentsu requires more than one additional tile, the answer is 2. However, in some cases, two draws might suffice to complete a sequence or triplet.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Initial Check**: For each tile, check if it forms a koutsu (three same tiles) or part of a shuntsu (two consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n   - **One Draw Check**: For each pair of tiles, determine if adding one specific tile (either the missing number in a sequence or the same tile for a triplet) would complete a mentsu.\n   - **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, two draws are needed to form a mentsu (e.g., completing a sequence or forming a triplet).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [data[0], data[1], data[2]]\n    \n    # Check if there's already a mentsu\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check if one draw can form a mentsu\n    if one_draw_possible(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    print(2)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_dict[tile] += 1\n    for count in count_dict.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles):\n    suits = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n    \n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        nums.sort()\n        unique_nums = []\n        for n in nums:\n            if n not in unique_nums:\n                unique_nums.append(n)\n        for i in range(len(unique_nums) - 2):\n            if unique_nums[i] + 1 == unique_nums[i+1] and unique_nums[i+1] + 1 == unique_nums[i+2]:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef one_draw_possible(tiles):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    suit_count = defaultdict(list)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        suit_count[suit].append(num)\n        \n    for suit, nums in suit_count.items():\n        if len(nums) == 3:\n            continue\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            num = nums[0]\n            if num + 1 <= 9 or num - 1 >= 1:\n                return True\n        elif len(nums) == 2:\n            n1, n2 = sorted(nums)\n            if n2 == n1 + 1:\n                return True\n            else:\n                if n1 + 1 == n2:\n                    return True\n                elif n1 + 2 == n2:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check (`is_koutsu` and `is_shuntsu`)**:\n   - **`is_koutsu`**: Uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears three times, it returns `True`.\n   - **`is_shuntsu`**: Groups tiles by suit and checks for three consecutive numbers in any suit. If found, it returns `True`.\n\n2. **One Draw Check (`one_draw_possible`)**:\n   - For each suit, checks if adding one tile can complete a sequence or triplet. For example, if two tiles of the same suit have numbers 1 and 3, adding 2 completes a sequence.\n\n3. **Default Case**:\n   - If no mentsu is found and one draw doesn't suffice, the answer is `2`, as two draws are needed to either complete a sequence or form a triplet.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
