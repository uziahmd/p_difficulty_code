There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. But the winner is the one who wins all his/her games.\n\n However, the constraint is that two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We can model the tournament as a complete binary tree? But note: the rule is about the number of games played (which is the level or depth of the player in the bracket). \n\n Actually, let's think:\n\n The winner must win k games. So the tournament structure must have at least k rounds. But the rule constrains the pairing: when the winner has already played k-1 games, then he can only play against an opponent that has either k-2, k-1, or k games? Actually, the rule says \"the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the other\".\n\n However, note: the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can play k games under the given rule.\n\n How do we build the tournament?\n\n Consider that the winner must win k consecutive games. Then, what is the minimal structure?\n\n We can use the following recursive idea:\n\n To have a match where the winner has k games (meaning he has won k matches), then the two opponents in his last game must have played either k-1 or k games (so they are either at the same level or one less).\n\n Actually, we can think of the tournament as having three levels (for the winner):\n\n Level 0: the winner hasn't played any game.\n Level 1: after first win, the winner has 1 game.\n ...\n Level k: the winner has k games.\n\n But also, the entire tournament must satisfy the condition for every match.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recurrence for the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\n Let F(k) = minimal number of players required for a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n How to form the tournament?\n\n The winner must defeat k opponents. However, the opponents themselves must come from subtrees.\n\n We can consider that the tournament is built in rounds, but the rule allows non-binary structure? Actually, the rule is about the difference in the number of games. This resembles a ternary structure.\n\n Alternatively, we can break down the tournament:\n\n - To have the winner play k games, we need to have k matches won by the winner.\n\n - Each match the winner plays requires that the opponent comes from a branch that has been built with the rule.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   F(0) = 1   [a player who hasn't played any game]\n   F(1) = 2   [two players: the winner and one opponent]\n\n For k>=2, consider:\n\n   The winner's k-th game: he plays against an opponent who must have played either k-1 or k-2 games (or k-1 and k-2 because the condition is at most one difference). However, to maximize the games for the winner, we want to minimize the total number of players.\n\n But note: the problem is to compute the maximum k (the number of games the winner can play) for a given n.\n\n Alternatively, we can invert the problem: find the maximum k such that the minimal number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games is <= n.\n\n Now, how to compute F(k)?\n\n Consider:\n\n   In order to have the winner play k games, we need to have k rounds. However, the rule allows that in the k-th game, the opponent can have either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner's path is clear.\n\n   Actually, we can use a recurrence that considers the minimal tournament that can produce a winner with k games.\n\n   The minimal tournament for k games:\n\n     Round 1: the winner must face someone. That someone must come from a subtree that can provide a player with 0 or 1 game? Actually, initially, everyone starts with 0 games.\n\n     However, the rule is applied at the time of the match. So for the first game, both players have 0 games.\n\n     After the first game, the winner has 1 game, and the loser leaves.\n\n     Then, for the second game, the winner must face another player. The other player must have either 0 or 1 game? But wait: the winner has 1 game, so the opponent must have 0 or 1 or 2? Actually, the condition is that the difference is at most one. So for the second game, the opponent can have 0 or 1 games (because 2 would be a difference of 2, which is not allowed). \n\n     But note: the opponent must have just come from somewhere. How do we build the minimal tournament?\n\n     We can think: the entire tournament is built by having two separate branches for the two players that the winner will face at different stages. However, the rule also constrains that the winner cannot play two games in a row without giving the opponent time to accumulate games?\n\n     Actually, the rule does not require that the entire tournament is played in rounds. It only constrains the pairing.\n\n     We can use a greedy construction:\n\n        Let T0 = 1 (the winner)\n        Then, to have the winner play his first game, we need one opponent. So we set T1 = 2.\n\n        Now, for the second game (k=2), the winner must play again. Who is the opponent? He can play either:\n          - A new player (with 0 games) OR \n          - The same opponent from the first round? But the opponent from the first round has already been eliminated.\n\n        Actually, the opponent must be a fresh player (since the previous opponent is gone) OR from a side tournament? \n\n        But note: the entire tournament must be arranged from the start. The rule is global: two players can play only if their game counts differ by at most one.\n\n        Let me try building the minimal tournament for k=3:\n\n          We need the winner to win 3 games.\n\n          Game1: winner (0) vs Player2 (0) -> winner has 1 game.\n          Now, to get to game2, the winner must play someone. But the only other players are Player3 and Player4 (if we have 4 players) or more.\n\n          However, we want minimal players.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          - First, we have two other mini-tournaments: one that produces a player with 1 game and one that produces a player with 0 games? \n\n          Actually, the structure is:\n\n            The winner must face an opponent that has either 1 or 2 games (at the moment of the third game). But wait, the third game is the final? Then the opponent must have played 2 games (if the winner played 3 games, then the opponent must have played 2 or 3? But 3 is not possible because the winner is the champion, so the opponent must have 2 games). How did the opponent get 2 games? He must have won two games.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal tournament for k=3 must have:\n\n            The winner's two opponents in the first two games must be provided by two separate tournaments that yield players with 0 and 1 games respectively? Or maybe we can combine.\n\n          Actually, we can use a recurrence that considers:\n\n            To have a player that has played k-1 games (to face the winner in the k-th game), we need a tournament that produced that player with k-1 wins, which requires F(k-1) players.\n\n            Additionally, to have the winner get to k games, we must have defeated k opponents (each opponent is the winner of a subtree). However, the rule also allows that the winner might not have played all his games consecutively? Actually, the rule is about the current state.\n\n          Another approach: the entire tournament can be seen as a ternary tree? \n\n          Actually, the minimal number of players for k games is:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n\n            For k>=2, the winner must have two types of opponents in his k-1 games (before the last) and the last opponent must have k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). But wait, the rule says: at the time of the k-th game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n          However, if we want to minimize the total players, we should use the minimal subtrees for each opponent.\n\n          Consider: \n            In the k-th game, the winner faces an opponent that has either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n            Case 1: opponent has k-1 games. Then the opponent must have come from a subtree that required F(k-1) players (to get k-1 wins). But note: the winner himself has k-1 wins (from the previous k-1 games). Then, the entire tournament so far (excluding the final) would have been built by:\n\n                - The winner's own k-1 wins: each of these wins required an opponent, and the minimal structure for those is given by F(1) to F(k-1) for the opponents.\n\n            But actually, the entire tournament is:\n\n                The winner must have beaten k opponents. Each of these opponents must have come from a subtree that had a minimal number of players.\n\n            However, the rule also constrains that the winner cannot have too many games in a row without having \"side\" tournaments for the opponents.\n\n          There is a known recurrence for this kind of tournament (similar to the problem \"Minimum initial players for a tournament\" but with the rule allowing two types of opponents) and it is similar to the recurrence for the minimum number of players to have a single elimination tournament with k rounds, but with the condition that the bracket can be built in a way that the winner can have up to k games.\n\n          Known similar problem: Codeforces problem \"Tennis Champions\" or others.\n\n          Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n            F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          Why?\n\n          Explanation:\n\n          To have the winner play k games, we need:\n\n            - One copy of the tournament for the winner to get to k-1 games (so that the winner has k-1 wins) and then one copy for the tournament that gives the opponent for the k-th game.\n\n          However, the opponent for the k-th game can be either from a tournament that took k-1 games (if the opponent has k-1 games) or k-2 games (if the opponent has k-2 games). But to minimize the total number of players, we choose the minimal between the two? Actually, we can use the entire structure as:\n\n            The tournament must have:\n\n              - The winner's k-1 wins: we need k-1 opponents. But these opponents don't necessarily have to be from a fixed structure. However, the rule applies at every match.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider that the entire tournament can be split into two parts:\n\n            The winner's own path: which requires k wins.\n\n            The rest: we need to provide the opponents for each of the k wins.\n\n          But note: the rule says that the two players must have game counts differing by at most one.\n\n          The minimal configuration is achieved when we use as few players as possible. We can use a recursive construction:\n\n            Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can have k games.\n\n            The last game (the k-th game) is between the winner (who has k-1 wins) and an opponent who must have either k-1 wins or k-2 wins.\n\n            If the opponent has k-1 wins, then we need a separate tournament of F(k-1) players to produce that opponent (and then the winner must have defeated k-1 opponents, each requiring their own tournaments). But wait, the winner's own k-1 wins must also be provided by opponents.\n\n            Actually, the entire tournament must have:\n\n              - The winner: 1 player.\n              - The k opponents: each opponent must have won some matches. \n\n            However, the minimal structure is:\n\n              To have the winner play k games, we must have:\n\n                - The first k-1 games: the winner plays k-1 times, and each time we need an opponent. But these opponents must come from subtrees that are independent. However, the rule allows that the opponent in the i-th game must have at most i-1 games (actually, the opponent must have between i-2 and i games, but since the opponent is being introduced at that time, we assume they have 0 or ...).\n\n          There is a known solution for a similar problem: the maximum number of wins (or the structure of the tournament) is limited by the recurrence of the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n          Specifically, the minimal number of players for the winner to have k games is:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n            F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          But wait, let's check:\n\n            k=0: 1 player -> the winner hasn't played any game (but then there are no other players, so n=1, but the problem says n>=2). But we are computing the minimal players for k games.\n\n            k=1: F(1)=2 -> correct, two players: winner and one opponent.\n\n            k=2: F(2)= F(1)+F(0)=2+1=3. But wait, with 3 players: \n                  We have three players: A (winner), B, C.\n                  The first game: A vs B -> A wins (now A has 1 game).\n                  Then, the second game: A vs C. But at this point, C has 0 games and A has 1 game -> difference is 1, so allowed. Then A wins again -> 2 games.\n\n                  So with 3 players, the winner can have 2 games. So F(2)=3.\n\n            k=3: F(3)=F(2)+F(1)=3+2=5.\n\n                  With 5 players: \n                    We can arrange as:\n\n                      First, we have two subtrees for the first two wins of the winner.\n\n                      The winner (A) must face two opponents: one that has 1 game and one that has 2 games? Actually, we can build:\n\n                      Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B eliminated)\n                      Now, we need two more players: C and D and E.\n\n                      But wait, the next game: A must face an opponent that has either 0 or 1 games. However, we have two players left: C and D, and E? Actually, we have 5 players: A,B,C,D,E.\n\n                      Alternatively, we can break down:\n\n                          The tournament must have:\n\n                            - The first win: A beats someone (B) -> now A has 1 game.\n\n                            - The second win: A must beat someone. But the rule says the opponent must have 0 or 1. We can have:\n\n                                Option 1: Beat a new player (C): then A has 2 games. Now, we have two players left: D and E.\n\n                            - The third win: A must beat someone. Now, the remaining players are D and E. They must have played each other? \n\n                            Actually, we need to arrange the games so that the rule is satisfied.\n\n                            How about:\n\n                              First, we have a preliminary tournament for the other players?\n\n                            Since the minimal number is 5, we can do:\n\n                              We need to have two opponents for the two games before the final.\n\n                              The first opponent (B) is a fresh player (0 games).\n\n                              The second opponent (C) must be built from two players? Because the rule for the second game: the opponent must have 0 or 1 game. If we use a fresh player (0 games) for the second game, then the third game: the remaining two players (D and E) must have 0 games. But then the difference between A (with 2 games) and the opponent (0 games) is 2 -> not allowed.\n\n                            So for the third game, we must have an opponent that has 1 game (so that the difference is 1). Therefore, the second game must not be a fresh player but a player that has played one game.\n\n                            How do we get a player with 1 game from the remaining 3 players? \n\n                            We can have:\n\n                              First, let the two other players (C and D) play each other: that gives one player (say C) with 1 game, and eliminate D.\n\n                              Then, the tournament:\n\n                                Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                Then, we have C (1 game) and D (0 games) and E (0 games). But wait, we started with 5 players: A,B,C,D,E.\n\n                                Actually, we used B and then we let C and D play:\n\n                                Game2: C vs D -> C wins (then C has 1 game, D eliminated). Now we have A (1 game), C (1 game), and E (0 games).\n\n                                Then, we need to arrange the next game for A: he can play E (because A has 1, E has 0 -> difference 1) OR he can play C (same). But if he plays C (both have 1 game) then that's allowed.\n\n                                Then, to get to the third game, we must have A beat one of them. Then the remaining two (if any) must be arranged.\n\n                            Alternatively, we can structure the tournament in a way that the winner's two first opponents are built from the other players.\n\n                            Actually, the recurrence F(k)=F(k-1)+F(k-2) is standard for the minimal number of players needed for a tournament that grows as a \"complete\" ternary-like structure? \n\n                            Let me check with k=3: minimal players 5.\n\n                            How is 5 arranged?\n\n                              Round 1: \n                                Match1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                Match2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n\n                              Now, we have three players: A (1), C (1), and E (0).\n\n                              Round 2:\n                                We must have a match between two of them. But the rule: \n                                  A and C: both 1 -> allowed.\n                                  A and E: 1 and 0 -> allowed.\n                                  C and E: 1 and 0 -> allowed.\n\n                              Let's say we have:\n\n                                Match3: A vs E -> A wins (A:2, E:0) -> then we have two players left: A and C (both with 1 game). Then the next match (Match4) is A vs C: A wins (A:3). \n\n                              So the winner A has 3 games. And the total players is 5.\n\n                            But wait, we used 5 players: A,B,C,D,E.\n\n                            Now, what if we have 4 players? Then k=3 would require 5, so maximum k for n=4 is 2.\n\n                            The sample: \n                              Input: 10 -> Output: 4\n\n                            What is the relation between n and k?\n\n                            We want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n                            Then, we can precompute F(k) until F(k) <= n, and then output k.\n\n                            However, note: n can be up to 10^18, so we cannot iterate k from 0 until we exceed 10^18 if we use a linear loop (but k is logarithmic? because Fibonacci grows exponentially). \n\n                            Steps:\n\n                              Step 1: Define F(0)=1, F(1)=2, and then F(k)=F(k-1)+F(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n                              Step 2: We are going to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n                            But wait, is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games?\n\n                            According to our construction, yes.\n\n                            Then, we can use:\n\n                              k=0: F(0)=1 -> n>=1, then k=0 is allowed (but n>=2, so k>=1)\n                              k=1: F(1)=2 -> n>=2\n                              k=2: F(2)=3 -> n>=3\n                              k=3: F(3)=5 -> n>=5\n                              k=4: F(4)=8 -> n>=8\n                              k=5: F(5)=13 -> n>=13\n                              k=6: F(6)=21 -> n>=21\n                              ...\n\n                            Then, for n=2: k=1\n                                 n=3: k=2\n                                 n=4: F(2)=3<=4, but F(3)=5>4 -> so k=2\n                                 n=5: k=3\n                                 n=10: F(4)=8<=10, F(5)=13>10 -> k=4\n\n                            The sample input: \n                                ['2', '3', '4', '10'] -> ['1','2','2','4']\n\n                            So it matches.\n\n                            However, note: the example n=4: the winner can have 2 games. How?\n\n                              With 4 players, we can have:\n\n                                Option1: \n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                  Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                                  Game3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1) -> then we have two players: A and the other one? Wait, we have four players: A,B,C,D. After game3, we have A and C? But then we need a fourth game? Actually, the tournament is knockout: after game3, A wins and becomes champion, but the tournament stops? \n\n                                Actually, the tournament doesn't require that the winner defeats all other players? It only requires that the winner wins k games (until the tournament ends). In a knockout tournament, the winner must defeat all others? Not exactly: the structure might not be a balanced bracket.\n\n                                However, the problem says: two players can play only if the condition holds.\n\n                                The example for n=4: \n\n                                  We can have:\n\n                                    First, we must have two games in the first round: (A vs B) and (C vs D). Then the winners (A and C) play. Then the winner of that (say A) has 2 wins. But then, is there a fourth player? No, because we have 4 players and we used all. \n\n                                But wait, the problem says: the tournament grid is arranged (meaning the entire set of games is fixed). The winner must be the one who wins the tournament. \n\n                                However, the rule says: two players can play only if the difference in the number of games is at most one. \n\n                                In the above arrangement, the first two games: A and C have 1 game, then the third game: A (1) and C (1) -> allowed. Then A wins and the tournament ends. \n\n                                So the winner (A) has 2 wins.\n\n                                Now, can the winner have 3 wins with 4 players? \n\n                                  The winner must play 3 games. Then we need 3 opponents. But with 4 players, the winner is one, so there are 3 opponents. However, the rule: the third game requires the opponent to have either 2 or 1 games? But the two opponents from the first two games are already eliminated. \n\n                                Actually, the winner must defeat 3 distinct opponents. But with 4 players, there are only 3 other players. \n\n                                However, the rule does not require that the tournament uses all players. But wait, the problem says: there will be n players. \n\n                                The tournament must use all players? Actually, in a knockout tournament, all players except the winner are eliminated. So the winner must defeat n-1 players. But wait, the rule says: two players can play if the condition holds. \n\n                                However, the example for n=4: we only had two games for the winner? Actually, the winner only needs to defeat log(n) opponents? Not exactly: in a balanced bracket, the winner defeats log2(n) opponents.\n\n                                But note: the problem does not specify that the tournament must use a fixed bracket. It says \"assuming the rule above is used\". \n\n                                We are allowed to arrange the tournament arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds) to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n                                How can the winner play more games? \n\n                                In the example with 4 players, we can also arrange:\n\n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1)\n                                  Then, we cannot have A play C immediately because then the next game would be A (1) vs C (0) -> allowed, but then we have two players left: A (2) and D (0). Then the next game: A vs D -> A wins (A:3). \n\n                                So the winner can have 3 games? \n\n                                But wait, the rule says: two players can play only if the number of games differs by at most one. \n\n                                In the above:\n\n                                  Game1: A and B: both 0 -> ok.\n                                  Game2: A and C: A has 1, C has 0 -> ok.\n                                  Game3: A and D: A has 2, D has 0 -> difference is 2 -> not allowed.\n\n                                So that is invalid.\n\n                                Alternatively:\n\n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1)\n                                  Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1)\n                                  Then, we have two games: A (1) and C (1). Then we can have:\n\n                                  Game3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2) -> then done.\n\n                                Or:\n\n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1)\n                                  Then, we have two other players: C and D. We cannot have A vs C (because then A has 1 and C 0 -> allowed) and then A vs D (A has 2 and D 0 -> not allowed). \n\n                                So the maximum for n=4 is 2.\n\n                                But wait, there is another possibility:\n\n                                  We don't have to use all players in the first round. Maybe:\n\n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B eliminated)\n                                  Now, we have C and D. Then, we can have a game between C and D? Then C wins (C:1). Then, we have A and C. Then, A vs C: A wins (A:2).\n\n                                Same as above.\n\n                                Or:\n\n                                  Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1)\n                                  Then, we have two players: C and D. Instead of having a game between C and D, we can have A vs C (allowed) and then we have D left. But then the tournament is over? No, because the winner must be declared only when all are eliminated. Actually, the tournament continues until there is one winner. \n\n                                But wait: the problem says \"knockout rules from the very first game\", meaning that after a loss, the player leaves. So the tournament continues until one remains.\n\n                                In the case of 4 players, the minimal number of games is 3 (each game eliminates one, so 3 games to eliminate 3). \n\n                                But we want to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\n                                The winner must win k games, but the total games is n-1. However, the winner's games are k, and the other losses are distributed.\n\n                                The constraint is on the pairing: the two players must have game counts within 1.\n\n                                So the arrangement:\n\n                                  We can have:\n\n                                    Round1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Then, we have C and D. We cannot have A vs C because then we leave D. Then we have:\n\n                                    Round2: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:0) -> but then D is still there. Then we have:\n\n                                    Round3: A vs D -> A wins (A:3, D:0) -> but then the rule: A has 2, D has 0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed.\n\n                                So we cannot have 3 wins.\n\n                                How about:\n\n                                    Round1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Round2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                                    Round3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1) -> then the tournament ends.\n\n                                This is valid because in round3, A has 1 and C has 1 -> difference 0, which is <=1.\n\n                                So the winner has 2 wins.\n\n                                Alternatively, is there a way to have the winner have 3 wins with 4 players? \n\n                                Let me try:\n\n                                  We need three wins for the winner. Then the winner must defeat three distinct opponents. But there are only three other players.\n\n                                  The games:\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Game2: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:0) -> but wait, the rule: A has 1, C has 0 -> allowed.\n                                    Game3: A vs D -> A wins (A:3, D:0) -> not allowed (difference 2).\n\n                                  So that fails.\n\n                                  Alternatively, we can have:\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                                    Game3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1) -> then we have no more players? Then the winner has 2 wins.\n\n                                  But wait, we have eliminated B and D, and C was eliminated in the third game? Then the tournament ends.\n\n                                  The issue: the winner must defeat all other players? Actually, in a knockout tournament, the winner must defeat all other players? \n\n                                  However, the problem does not specify that. The problem says: the tournament follows knockout rules. That means that each loss eliminates the player. The winner is the last one standing.\n\n                                  So the winner must have defeated all the other players. But wait, in the above arrangement with 4 players, the winner A defeated B and C, but D was eliminated by C. Then A did not defeat D. So the tournament is not over: there is still D? \n\n                                  Actually, no: after the third game, the two players left were A and C. Then we have two players: A (with 2 wins) and C (with 1 win). Then we have a fourth game: A vs C. But wait, we already did that? \n\n                                  Actually, the structure:\n\n                                    Initially: [A, B, C, D]\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> [A, C, D] (B eliminated)\n                                    Game2: C vs D -> [A, C] (D eliminated)\n                                    Game3: A vs C -> [A] (C eliminated)\n\n                                  So the winner A has 2 wins.\n\n                                  But wait, why is D eliminated by C? Then A never played D. And the rule does not require that the winner must play everyone. It only requires that the pairing condition holds.\n\n                                  However, the tournament must eliminate all players except the winner. So D is eliminated by C, and then C is eliminated by A.\n\n                                  But note: the winner A has not played against D. Is that allowed? \n\n                                  Yes, because the rule is only about the pairing condition. The tournament grid can be arbitrary as long as the condition holds and the knockout rule (each loss leaves the tournament) is followed.\n\n                                  However, the problem says: the maximum number of games the winner can take part in. \n\n                                  In the above, the winner A played 2 games.\n\n                                  But could we have a structure where the winner plays 3 games?\n\n                                  We have 3 other players: B, C, D.\n\n                                  The winner must defeat all three? But wait, no: the tournament ends when only the winner remains. So the winner must defeat the ones that are in the same \"branch\" as him. However, the condition does not force the winner to play everyone.\n\n                                  Actually, the total games in the tournament is 3 (for 4 players). The winner's games are 2, and the other two games are by C and then by the winner again.\n\n                                  But note: the winner's games are only the ones he wins. The other games (like the one by C) are not counted for the winner.\n\n                                  How can the winner have 3 wins? He must defeat 3 players. \n\n                                  But there are only 3 other players, so the winner must defeat B, C, and D. \n\n                                  Then, the games:\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Game2: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:0) -> then we have D left. \n                                    Game3: A vs D -> A wins (A:3, D:0) -> but the rule: A has 2 and D has 0 -> difference 2 -> invalid.\n\n                                  Alternatively, we can interleave:\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                                    Game3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1) -> then we have no more players? But wait, we have eliminated B, D, and C. Then the tournament ends. \n\n                                  So the winner has 2 wins.\n\n                                  Another arrangement:\n\n                                    Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                                    Game2: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:0) -> then we have D left.

Then we must have a third game: A vs C -> A wins. Then we have one player. \n\n                                  So the winner has 2 wins.\n\n                                  Therefore, for n=4, the answer is 2.\n\n                                  And our recurrence: F(2)=3 <=4, and F(3)=5>4 -> so k=2.\n\n                            So the plan:\n\n                              We want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n, where:\n\n                                F(0) = 1\n                                F(1) = 2\n                                F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)   for k>=2.\n\n                            But note: the recurrence F(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n                            Then, we can iterate k until F(k) > n, and then the maximum k is the last one that was <= n.\n\n                            However, note: k=0 is not considered because n>=2.\n\n                            Steps:\n\n                              Let a0 = 1, a1 = 2.\n                              k = 0: F(0)=1\n                              k = 1: F(1)=2\n                              k = 2: F(2)=3\n                              k = 3: F(3)=5\n                              k = 4: F(4)=8\n                              k = 5: F(5)=13\n                              ...\n\n                            Then, for a given n, we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n                            Example: \n                              n=2 -> k=1 (since F(1)=2<=2, F(2)=3>2)\n                              n=3 -> k=2 (F(2)=3<=3, F(3)=5>3)\n                              n=4 -> k=2 (F(2)=3<=4, F(3)=5>4)\n                              n=10 -> k=4 (F(4)=8<=10, F(5)=13>10)\n\n                            But wait, the example output for n=10 is 4.\n\n                            However, note: the winner's number of games is k. In our recurrence, F(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\n                            Therefore, the answer for n is k (the maximum k for which F(k)<=n).\n\n                            But wait: what if n is very large? We cannot iterate k from 0 to ... until F(k)>n because k would be about log_phi(n) (base the golden ratio) and n is up to 10^18, which is about 90 terms (since the Fibonacci sequence grows as (phi^k)/sqrt(5) ~ 10^18 for k around 90). So we can iterate.\n\n                            Algorithm:\n\n                              Initialize:\n                                a, b = 1, 2   # F(0) and F(1)\n                                k = 0\n                                count = 0       # will count the number of games (k)\n\n                              Then, while b <= n:\n                                  a, b = b, a+b\n                                  count += 1\n\n                              But wait, we start counting from k=0 and k=1.\n\n                              Actually, we want to count the k (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games does not exceed one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the goal is to find the largest number of games the winner can win under these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for `k` games is the sum of the minimal players required for `k-1` and `k-2` games. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has either played `k-1` or `k-2` games previously, leading to a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a loop to generate the sequence of minimal players required for increasing numbers of games (starting from 0 and 1) until the minimal number exceeds the given `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the highest `k` for which the minimal players required is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. Given that `n` can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\), the loop runs in logarithmic time relative to `n`, specifically \\(O(\\log n)\\) iterations, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 2, the winner can only play 1 game, so the answer is printed directly.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the minimal players needed for 0 and 1 games respectively. The loop continues to generate subsequent terms of the sequence by summing the previous two terms (`a` and `b`).\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the current term (`b`) exceeds `n`. The count `k` keeps track of the number of games being considered.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is `k - 1` because the loop exits when the minimal players for `k` games exceeds `n`, so the valid maximum is `k - 1`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
