    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = (a+k, b+k) be the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k). Note that:\n   d divides (a+k) and (b+k), so it also divides (b+k - (a+k)) = b - a (if a != b).\n\n Therefore, if we assume without loss of generality that a < b, then the differences are fixed: d divides (b - a) and also d divides (a+k) and (b+k).\n\n Also note that:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / GCD(a+k, b+k)\n\n Since (a+k)*(b+k) is fixed for a given k, but actually we can't fix that because k changes, we need to consider the structure.\n\n However, note that as k increases, the numbers (a+k) and (b+k) increase. But the LCM might not be monotonic.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let d be the divisor of the absolute difference (b - a) (if a==b, then we have a special case). Then we can set:\n\n   Let g = GCD(a+k, b+k). Then g divides (b-a). So we can let d = |b - a|, and then consider divisors of d.\n\n But note: when k increases, the gcd might change arbitrarily? Actually, we know that the gcd must divide (b-a). So the possible gcds are the divisors of (b-a) (unless a==b, then the gcd is at least 1 and can be any divisor of ... but then we have a=b, so gcd is (a+k) which we cannot control arbitrarily).\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: a == b.\n   Then we have LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. The smallest LCM is when k=0, so output 0.\n\n Case 2: a != b.\n\n   We know that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide (b-a). Let d = |b - a|. Then the gcd is a divisor of d.\n\n   Now, note: \n        (a+k) * (b+k) = GCD(a+k, b+k) * LCM(a+k, b+k)\n\n   We want to minimize the LCM, which is equivalent to minimizing (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k, b+k). \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: for a divisor g of d, we wish to find the smallest k (nonnegative) such that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). \n\n   Condition: \n        (a+k) mod g = 0 and (b+k) mod g = 0.\n\n   This is equivalent to: k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\n   But note: since g divides (b-a), we have (b mod g) = (a mod g) + (b-a) mod g, but actually (b - a) mod g is 0. So (a mod g) ≡ (b mod g). Therefore, the congruences are compatible.\n\n   So for a divisor g (which divides d = |b-a|), the condition is that k must satisfy:\n        k ≡ (-a) mod g   (and automatically k ≡ (-b) mod g because a ≡ b mod g)\n\n   The smallest nonnegative k for this divisor g is:\n        k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n   However, note: if a % g is 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g).\n\n   But wait: we have two conditions. Actually, the condition is that k ≡ (-a) mod g, which is the same as k ≡ (g - (a % g)) mod g, unless a % g ==0 then k≡0 mod g. So the smallest nonnegative k for divisor g is k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g, but note that modulo operation with negative: we can compute:\n\n        k0 = (-a) % g   [This gives the smallest nonnegative residue]\n\n   However, note that (-a) % g = g - (a % g) if a % g !=0, and 0 if a % g==0.\n\n   But note: we are only considering divisors g of d (the absolute difference). And we have to consider all divisors? Because the LCM might be minimized by a particular divisor.\n\n   However, note: the LCM for a fixed k is determined by the gcd, and the gcd must be a divisor of d. But the minimal LCM might occur for different divisors.\n\n   But here's an important point: the LCM for a given divisor g (with corresponding k0) is:\n\n        LCM = (a+k0)*(b+k0) / g\n\n   However, note: the gcd might be greater than g. Actually, the gcd is the GCD(a+k0, b+k0) which is at least g (since g divides both). But wait, we set g as the divisor we are considering, and we set k0 so that g divides both. However, the actual gcd could be any multiple of g? Not necessarily. Actually, the gcd must be a divisor of d, and it must be at least g (if g divides both, then the gcd is at least g). But in fact, we set k0 to satisfy the condition for g, but the actual gcd might be a multiple of g (if there is a larger common divisor). However, we are iterating over divisors, and note that the gcd is the GCD of (a+k0, b+k0). Since (a+k0) and (b+k0) are divisible by g, their gcd is divisible by g, but we don't know exactly.\n\n   Actually, we cannot assume that the gcd is g. It could be any divisor of d that is a multiple of g? No, the divisors of d are fixed, and the gcd must be one of them. But note: we are free to choose k, and we are considering k0 for divisor g, but then the actual gcd might be a divisor of d that is greater than g (if k0 makes the numbers share more factors). However, we are trying to relate k to the divisors.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   Let g0 = GCD(a+k, b+k). Then note that g0 divides (b-a). Therefore, we can iterate over the divisors of |b-a| and for each divisor g, we can set k0 as above and then compute the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0). Then we take the minimum LCM and the smallest k that achieves that minimum.\n\n   However, note: the gcd might be greater than g (if we set k0 for a divisor g, then the gcd might be a multiple of g). But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will eventually consider the true gcd as well. But note: the true gcd must divide (b-a) and we are iterating over all divisors, including the ones that are multiples of g.\n\n   But wait: if we set k0 for divisor g, then the gcd might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g. However, we are also going to consider that multiple divisor (say h) separately. So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n   However, note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. There might be multiple divisors that lead to the same k or different k.\n\n   Steps for a != b:\n\n   1. Let d = abs(b - a)\n   2. Find all divisors of d (including 1 and d).\n   3. For each divisor g of d, compute k0 = (-a) % g. But note: we require that k0 is the smallest nonnegative integer such that (a+k0) mod g == 0 and (b+k0) mod g == 0.\n\n      Actually, k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g   [This is the standard way to compute the smallest nonnegative k for which (a+k) is divisible by g, but note: we also require that (b+k) is divisible by g. However, because g divides (b-a), then if g divides (a+k) then it divides (b+k) because (b+k) = (a+k) + (b-a) and g divides (b-a). So we only need to ensure that g divides (a+k).]\n\n   4. Then, for candidate k0, we can compute the LCM of (a+k0) and (b+k0). But note: the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) might not be g, but a multiple of g (say g0). Then the LCM would be (a+k0)*(b+k0) // g0.\n\n      However, we don't know g0. But note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we are going to consider g0 as well. But we cannot compute g0 without knowing k0? Actually, we can: because we know that the gcd must divide d, and we know that (a+k0) and (b+k0) are divisible by g, so the gcd is at least g. But we don't know the exact value.\n\n   5. Alternatively, we can compute the gcd for (a+k0, b+k0) using Euclidean algorithm. Then use that to compute LCM.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over divisors of d. But the set of divisors is limited (at most around 1344 divisors for numbers up to 10^9). But note: d can be as large as 10^9, so we must factorize d first.\n\n   But wait: what if d is very large? Factorizing numbers up to 10^9 is acceptable in Python if we do it carefully (using trial division up to sqrt(d)).\n\n   However, there is a catch: the problem says a, b can be up to 10^9, so d can be up to 10^9. Factorizing a number up to 10^9 might be acceptable in C++/Java but in Python we have to be careful. But note: worst-case 10^9 has about 1000 divisors, and we can factorize 10^9 in about O(sqrt(10^9)) ~ 31622, which is acceptable in Python if optimized.\n\n   But note: we are only required to consider divisors of d. However, we must also consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we want the minimal k that minimizes the LCM.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the candidate k0 from divisor g might not be the only k that yields a gcd divisible by g. But note: we are required to minimize the LCM, and the LCM is determined by the gcd. The key is: the minimal LCM might occur for a divisor g that is the actual gcd. But note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/g, and if the actual gcd is g0 (which is a divisor of d) then the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/g0. However, if we set k0 for divisor g, then the actual gcd might be g0 (which is a divisor of d and >= g). But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will get the same k0 from multiple divisors? Actually, no: k0 is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer such that g divides (a+k0). But if g divides d, then the condition for g is independent of other divisors.\n\n   However, note: we must consider that the same k might be produced by multiple divisors. For example, if we have divisors g1 and g2 and k0(g1)=k0(g2)=k, then we have two candidates for the same k.\n\n   But we are only interested in the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. So we can:\n\n     candidate_k = set()\n     For each divisor g of d (if d>0):\n        k0 = (-a) % g   [this gives the smallest nonnegative k such that (a+k0) is divisible by g, and by the above, (b+k0) is divisible by g]\n        candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n     Then we also have to consider k=0, but note: k0 computed from divisors might include 0.\n\n   However, wait: is that sufficient? Consider: we are only considering divisors of d. But note: the gcd of (a+k, b+k) must divide d. Therefore, the k that minimizes the LCM must be one of the k0 we computed for divisors of d.\n\n   Why? Because if we let g0 = GCD(a+k, b+k), then g0 divides d. So k must be congruent to (-a) mod g0, so k0 (for divisor g0) is the smallest nonnegative k for that divisor. Therefore, the minimal k for the actual gcd must be considered.\n\n   But note: the actual k we choose might be larger than k0 for divisor g0, but we are looking for the smallest k overall. However, we are generating the minimal k for each divisor. Then we must compare the LCM for each candidate k (from each divisor) and choose the one with the smallest LCM, and if multiple k have the same LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n   However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. Then we would compute the LCM for (a+k, b+k) once and compare.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. If a == b, output 0.\n\n     2. Else:\n        d = abs(b - a)\n        Factorize d to get all divisors.\n\n        candidate_k = set()\n        For each divisor g in divisors(d):\n            k0 = (-a) % g   [if g==0, skip, but g is divisor so positive]\n            candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n        But wait: is that correct? Actually, we should consider that k0 is the smallest nonnegative integer such that (a+k0) is divisible by g. However, note that (-a) % g is the smallest nonnegative integer k0 such that (a+k0) mod g == 0.\n\n        Then, we also have to consider that k0 must be the same for the divisor g, and then the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) is some divisor of d (which we don't know). Then we compute the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0) by:\n\n           n1 = a + k0\n           n2 = b + k0\n           g0 = gcd(n1, n2)   [which is at least g, and divides d]\n\n           lcm_candidate = (n1 * n2) // g0\n\n        Then we compare the LCM_candidate for each candidate_k and choose the candidate_k that minimizes the LCM, and if there are multiple, the smallest k.\n\n        However, note: the set of candidate_k we built is from divisors of d. But is it true that the optimal k must be one of these? Yes, because the gcd must divide d, so the k must be one of the residues modulo the divisors.\n\n        But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. Then we don't want to compute the LCM multiple times.\n\n        However, the problem: we are iterating over divisors, and we are storing candidate_k as a set. Then we can compute the LCM for each distinct k.\n\n        But wait: what if the minimal k is not generated by any divisor? Actually, the condition for the gcd being a divisor of d forces k to satisfy the congruence for that divisor. But the minimal k that minimizes the LCM must be one of these. Why?\n\n        Explanation: Let k* be the answer. Then let g0 = GCD(a+k*, b+k*). Then g0 divides (b-a) (because it divides both a+k* and b+k*, so divides their difference). Therefore, g0 is a divisor of d. Then k* must satisfy k* ≡ (-a) mod g0, so k* is at least (-a) mod g0 (the minimal nonnegative solution). But note: our candidate_k for divisor g0 is (-a) % g0, which is the minimal k for divisor g0. However, k* might be larger than that? Actually, no: because if k0 is the minimal k for divisor g0, then k0 is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for divisor g0. But k* is the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. However, the LCM is determined by the gcd, which is g0 (or a multiple of g0?) Actually, the gcd is g0, so the condition is that g0 divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). But k* must be at least k0 (the minimal solution for the divisor g0). However, there might be a smaller k that is not generated by any divisor? \n\n        Let me clarify: the condition for having a gcd g0 is that g0 divides (a+k) and (b+k). The minimal k for which g0 divides (a+k) is k0 = (-a) % g0. Therefore, if there exists a k (say k_min) that minimizes the LCM, then the gcd g0 must divide d, and k_min must be at least k0 (for divisor g0). But note: we are generating k0 for every divisor. However, we are generating k0 for divisor g0, and k_min might be larger than k0 (if we don't use the minimal k for divisor g0). \n\n        But wait, why would we use a k larger than the minimal k for divisor g0? Because the minimal k for divisor g0 is the smallest k that makes g0 divide both. However, the LCM might be minimized by a k that is not the minimal k for the divisor that is the actual gcd. \n\n        Example: \n          a=6, b=10 -> d=4, divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n          For g=1: k0 = (-6)%1 = 0 -> then n1=6, n2=10, gcd=2, LCM=30.\n          For g=2: k0 = (-6)%2 = 0 -> then n1=6, n2=10, gcd=2, LCM=30.\n          For g=4: k0 = (-6)%4 = 2 -> then n1=8, n2=12, gcd=4, LCM=24.\n\n          So the minimal LCM is 24 at k=2.\n\n        What if we try k=1?\n          Then numbers: 7 and 11, gcd=1, LCM=77 -> worse.\n\n        What if we try k=3?\n          Then numbers: 9 and 13, gcd=1, LCM=117.\n\n        So k=2 is the answer.\n\n        But note: the divisor g0 for k=2 is 4. We generated k=2 from divisor 4.\n\n        However, consider if we didn't generate k=2 from divisor 4, but from divisor 2 we got k0=0, which is the minimal k for divisor 2. But k=2 is also a multiple of the minimal k (0) for divisor 2? Actually, k=2 is the next solution for divisor 2: the solutions for divisor 2 are k ≡ 0 mod 2. So k=0,2,4,... \n\n        But we are only taking the minimal k for each divisor. Why is k=2 the minimal k for divisor 4? Because 4 divides (6+2)=8 and (10+2)=12.\n\n        Now, the catch: we must consider that the actual gcd might be a divisor of d, but the minimal k for that divisor is the candidate. However, there might be a divisor g (say divisor 4) that gives a candidate k0=2, and then the actual gcd is 4 (so the LCM is (8*12)//4 = 24). But note: if we consider divisor 2, we get k0=0 and then the actual gcd is 2, and LCM= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n          candidate_k = set()\n          For each divisor g of d (excluding 0, and positive divisors):\n              k0 = (-a) % g   [this gives the smallest nonnegative k such that (a+k0) is divisible by g, and because g divides (b-a), then (b+k0) is divisible by g]\n              candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n          Then, we must also consider that the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, but we use a set so duplicates are removed.\n\n          Then, we compute for each k in candidate_k:\n\n            n1 = a + k\n            n2 = b + k\n            g0 = gcd(n1, n2)   [this is the actual gcd]\n            lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g0\n\n          Then we choose the k that minimizes lcm_val, and if there are multiple k with the same lcm_val, choose the smallest k.\n\n        However, wait: is it possible that a candidate k is not the minimal k for the divisor that is the actual gcd? \n\n        Example: \n          Suppose we have divisor g0 (the actual gcd) and k_min0 = (-a) % g0. Then if we consider a divisor g that is a divisor of g0 (which is a divisor of d), then we might generate a candidate k that is less than k_min0? \n\n        But note: we are generating k0 for every divisor. The actual gcd g0 must be one of the divisors, and we are generating the minimal k for g0. Then the minimal k for g0 is k_min0. But note: the same k might be generated by a divisor that is a divisor of g0? \n\n        However, if k_min0 is the minimal k for divisor g0, then for a divisor g (divisor of g0) we have:\n\n            k_min0 = (-a) % g0\n\n        and for divisor g, we have:\n\n            k_g = (-a) % g\n\n        How do k_min0 and k_g relate? \n\n        Since g divides g0, then the condition for g is weaker. So the minimal k for g (k_g) is the minimal nonnegative integer such that g divides (a+k). But note: if g divides g0, then k_min0 (which satisfies g0 divides (a+k_min0)) implies that g divides (a+k_min0). Therefore, k_min0 is a candidate for divisor g. However, k_g might be less than k_min0.\n\n        Example: \n          a=6, b=10, d=4, divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n          Consider divisor g0=4: k_min0=2.\n          Consider divisor g=2: k_g = (-6)%2 = 0.\n\n          Then k_g=0 < k_min0=2.\n\n        But note: the gcd for k=0 is 2, which is divisor 2. So we are generating k=0 from divisor 2.\n\n        Therefore, the set candidate_k includes the minimal k for every divisor, and that set is the set of all minimal k for each divisor.\n\n        However, note: the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k such that g divides (a+k). This k might be 0, or positive. But note: the condition for the gcd being the actual divisor g0 requires that g0 divides (a+k). The minimal k for g0 is k_min0, but if we use a divisor g (that divides g0) we get a candidate k_g that is smaller. Then we compute the LCM for k_g, and we see that the actual gcd is g (or a divisor of g) and the LCM might be larger.\n\n        But note: the LCM for k_g is (a+k_g)*(b+k_g)/gcd(a+k_g, b+k_g). The gcd might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g (but we don't know). \n\n        However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        But wait: what if the minimal k that minimizes the LCM is not the minimal k for the divisor that is the actual gcd? \n\n        Example: \n          Let a=2, b=14, d=12. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n          k0 for divisor 1: 0 -> n1=2, n2=14, gcd=2, LCM=14.\n          k0 for divisor 2: 0 -> same as above.\n          k0 for divisor 3: (-2)%3 = 1 -> n1=3, n2=15, gcd=3, LCM=15.\n          k0 for divisor 4: (-2)%4 = 2 -> n1=4, n2=16, gcd=4, LCM=16.\n          k0 for divisor 6: (-2)%6 = 4 -> n1=6, n2=18, gcd=6, LCM= (6*18)//6 = 18.\n          k0 for divisor 12: (-2)%12 = 10 -> n1=12, n2=24, gcd=12, LCM=24.\n\n          The minimal LCM is 14 at k=0.\n\n        Now, is there a k that is not in {0,1,2,4,10} that gives a lower LCM? \n\n        k=3: numbers 5 and 17 -> gcd=1, LCM=85 -> worse.\n        k=5: numbers 7 and 19 -> gcd=1, LCM=133 -> worse.\n        k=6: numbers 8 and 20 -> gcd=4, LCM=40 -> worse.\n\n        So k=0 is the best.\n\n        But note: the divisor that gave k=0 was 1 and 2, and the actual gcd was 2 (so divisor 2). \n\n        The algorithm is: we consider all divisors and the candidate k0 for each, then we compute the LCM for each candidate k0 and pick the best.\n\n        However, note: the set of candidate_k is the set of minimal k for each divisor. But the problem says \"non-negative integer k\", so we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. But note: the minimal k for divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for divisor g. However, the LCM might be minimized at a k that is larger than the minimal k for the divisor that is the actual gcd. \n\n        Example: \n          Consider a=2, b=8, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n          k0 for divisor1: 0 -> (2,8): gcd=2, LCM=8.\n          k0 for divisor2: 0 -> same.\n          k0 for divisor3: (-2)%3=1 -> (3,9): gcd=3, LCM=9.\n          k0 for divisor6: (-2)%6=4 -> (6,12): gcd=6, LCM=12.\n\n          Now, what about k=2?\n            (4,10): gcd=2, LCM=20 -> worse than 8.\n\n          k=3?\n            (5,11): gcd=1, LCM=55 -> worse.\n\n          k=5?\n            (7,13): gcd=1, LCM=91 -> worse.\n\n          But wait, is there a k that is not the minimal k for any divisor? \n\n          Actually, note: the condition for the gcd being a divisor g is that k must be congruent to (-a) mod g. So the set of k that yield a gcd divisible by g is periodic with period g. Therefore, the minimal k for each divisor is the smallest in its residue class. But we are only taking the minimal k for each divisor.\n\n        However, consider: the minimal k for divisor g is the smallest nonnegative k such that g divides (a+k). Then the next k that satisfies the same divisor g is k0 + g, k0 + 2g, etc. But note: we are only concerned with the minimal k overall. Why would we consider a k that is larger than the minimal k for some divisor? \n\n        The catch: the actual gcd might be a divisor g0 (that we haven't considered as the divisor that gives the minimal k) and the minimal k for g0 is k0, but then we must consider k0, k0+g0, k0+2g0, ... until we find the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. \n\n        But note: the minimal k for divisor g0 is k0, and we are already considering k0. However, the LCM might be the same for k0 and k0+g0? \n\n        Let me test:\n\n          a=2, b=8, g0=2: minimal k0=0, then k=0: (2,8) -> LCM=8.\n          k=2 (0+2): (4,10) -> LCM=20.\n          k=4 (0+4): (6,12) -> LCM=12.\n\n          So k=0 is better.\n\n        But consider another example:\n\n          a=5, b=11, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n          k0 for divisor1: 0 -> (5,11): gcd=1, LCM=55.\n          k0 for divisor2: 1 -> (6,12): gcd=6, LCM=12.\n          k0 for divisor3: 1 -> (6,12): same as above? Actually, (-5)%3: \n            (-5) mod 3: \n                -5 // 3 = -2 (floor division) -> remainder = -5 - (-2)*3 = 1. So k0=1.\n          k0 for divisor6: 5 -> (10,16): gcd=2, LCM=80.\n\n          Now, what about k=3 (which is the next solution for divisor2 or divisor3)? \n            k=3: (8,14): gcd=2, LCM=56.\n\n          k=4: (9,15): gcd=3, LCM=45.\n\n          k=5: (10,16): already considered.\n\n          The minimal LCM is 12 at k=1.\n\n          But note: k=3 (which is 1+2) is the next solution for divisor2 (which is 2). Then the gcd for k=3 is 2, so the divisor is 2. However, we are not generating k=3 from divisor2 because we only take the minimal k for divisor2 (which is 1). \n\n          But wait, the problem: the LCM for k=1 is 12, and for k=3 is 56, which is worse. So k=1 is still better.\n\n          However, consider if we had:\n\n          a=5, b=11, d=6.\n\n          k=1: LCM=12\n          k=3: LCM=56\n          k=4: LCM=45\n\n          So the minimal LCM is 12 at k=1.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          a=5, b=11, d=6, but let me change the numbers:\n\n          Let a=5, b=15, d=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n          k0 for divisor1: 0 -> (5,15): gcd=5, LCM=15.\n          k0 for divisor2: 1 -> (6,16): gcd=2, LCM=48.\n          k0 for divisor5: 0 -> same as divisor1? (5,15): gcd=5, LCM=15.\n          k0 for divisor10: 5 -> (10,20): gcd=10, LCM=20.\n\n          Now, consider k=5 (minimal for divisor10) -> LCM=20.\n\n          Now, what about k=2 (not minimal for any divisor, but let's check)?\n            (7,17): gcd=1, LCM=119.\n\n          k=3: (8,18): gcd=2, LCM=72.\n\n          k=4: (9,19): gcd=1, LCM=171.\n\n          So the minimal LCM is 15 at k=0.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to consider the minimal k for each divisor, because if a divisor g0 gives a candidate k0, then any k that is not k0 (and not the minimal k for any divisor) will have a gcd that is a divisor of d, say g1, and then the minimal k for g1 is already in our candidate set (and k0 is the minimal for g1). Moreover, the LCM for k0 (the minimal k for divisor g0) is (a+k0)*(b+k0)/g0, and for any k>=k0, the numbers (a+k) and (b+k) are larger, so the LCM might be larger. However, sometimes the LCM might be the same? \n\n        But note: we are only concerned with the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. The minimal k for divisor g0 is k0, and the next k (k0+g0) would make the numbers even larger. Therefore, the minimal k for divisor g0 is the only candidate we need to consider for divisor g0.\n\n        However, wait: what if the actual gcd for k0 is not g0, but a divisor of g0? Then the LCM might be larger. But note: the gcd for k0 must be a divisor of d and divisible by g0? Actually, no: the gcd must be a divisor of d and must divide both (a+k0) and (b+k0). But we set k0 so that g0 divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Therefore, the gcd must be at least g0. But the gcd might be a multiple of g0? Only if g0 is not the actual gcd. However, the gcd is the GCD(a+k0, b+k0) and that number must divide d. \n\n        But note: the set of divisors we consider includes all divisors of d, so the gcd is one of the divisors. And we are computing the gcd from the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n          Step 1: if a == b: print 0.\n\n          Step 2: Let d = abs(b-a). If d==0, then a==b, so handled.\n\n          Step 3: Factorize d to get all divisors.\n\n          Step 4: candidate_k = set()\n                   for each divisor g in divisors:\n                       k0 = (-a) % g   [if g==0, skip, but g is divisor so positive]\n                       candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n          Step 5: Also, we must consider k=0? But note: divisor 1 is always present, and (-a)%1=0, so 0 is included.\n\n          Step 6: Then, we must compute the LCM for each candidate_k. However, note: the candidate_k set might be large (number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d))). But d can be up to 10^9, and the maximum number of divisors is about 1344 (as mentioned). So we can iterate over the divisors and then over the candidate_k set (which has at most 1344 elements). Then for each candidate k, we compute:\n\n                  n1 = a + k\n                  n2 = b + k\n                  g0 = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n                  lcm_val = n1 * n2 // g0\n\n          Then we choose the candidate k that minimizes lcm_val, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\n        However, note: the numbers a+k and b+k can be as large as 10^9 + 10^9 (if k is large) but wait: k is the candidate from divisors, and the divisors are of d (which is |b-a|, so at most 10^9). The maximal k we consider is at most d (the divisor itself, because (-a)%g is at most g-1, and g<=d). But d is |b-a|, which is up to 10^9, so k can be up to 10^9. Then n1 and n2 can be up to 2e9, and the product is up to 4e18, which is acceptable in Python (integers are arbitrary precision, but we are doing one multiplication per candidate, and the set of candidates is at most 1344, so 1344 multiplications of numbers up to 2e9 is acceptable",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This is because the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must also divide their difference, which is \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), we can compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( (-a) \\% g \\). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Case 1**: If \\( a = b \\), the answer is trivially \\( 0 \\) since \\( \\text{LCM}(a + k, a + k) \\) is minimized when \\( k = 0 \\).\n   - **Case 2**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), factorize \\( |a - b| \\) to get all its divisors. For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Then, for each such \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). The minimal LCM among all these candidates gives the solution.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The factorization step dominates the complexity. For a number \\( n \\), factorization takes \\( O(\\sqrt{n}) \\) time. Given \\( n \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\), this is feasible as \\( \\sqrt{10^9} \\) is around 31622, which is manageable in Python.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport sys\n\ndef factorize(n):\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= n:\n        cnt = 0\n        while n % d == 0:\n            cnt += 1\n            n //= d\n        if cnt > 0:\n            factors.append((d, cnt))\n        d += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append((n, 1))\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors_from_factors(factors):\n    divisors = [1]\n    for (prime, exp) in factors:\n        new_divs = []\n        for power in range(1, exp + 1):\n            factor_power = prime ** power\n            for d in divisors:\n                new_divs.append(d * factor_power)\n        divisors += new_divs\n    divisors = list(set(divisors))\n    return divisors\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(b - a)\n    factors = factorize(d)\n    divisors_list = get_divisors_from_factors(factors)\n    \n    candidate_k_set = set()\n    for g in divisors_list:\n        k0 = (-a) % g\n        candidate_k_set.add(k0)\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm_val = None\n    \n    for k in candidate_k_set:\n        n1 = a + k\n        n2 = b + k\n        g0 = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n        lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g0\n        \n        if best_lcm_val is None or lcm_val < best_lcm_val:\n            best_lcm_val = lcm_val\n            best_k = k\n        elif lcm_val == best_lcm_val:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Factorization**: The function `factorize` decomposes the absolute difference \\( |a - b| \\) into its prime factors. This helps in generating all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n2. **Divisor Generation**: The function `get_divisors_from_factors` uses the prime factorization to generate all possible divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is computed using \\( (-a) \\% g \\). These \\( k \\) values are collected in a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **LCM Comparison**: For each candidate \\( k \\), the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is computed. The \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM is selected. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimal LCM, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging the divisors of the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
