Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. We need to check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight lines connecting each spaceship to its base do not intersect.\n\n Observation: Since the points are in general position (no three collinear) and the assignment must be a perfect matching, we can use a recursive backtracking (brute force) because R and B are at most 10, so maximum 10! possibilities (which is 3628800, acceptable for n=10? Actually, worst-case 10! is about 3.6 million, but we have two sets of 10 points, so we are matching 10 bases to 10 ships, and we can use recursion with pruning).\n\n However, note: the problem says that the assignment must be a perfect matching (so R = B, otherwise it's impossible). But the input says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and the constraint is that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So we must have R = B. But the input gives two integers R and B first. What if R != B? Then we cannot have a perfect matching. So:\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n 3. Otherwise, read the next R lines for spaceships and then B lines for bases.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n   First line: \"3 3\"\n   Then 3 lines for spaceships, then 3 lines for bases.\n\n However, the second example input: \"2 1\", so R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so we output 'No'.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and requires a perfect matching (each base has one and each spaceship has one). Therefore, the number of spaceships must equal the number of bases.\n\n So, we can assume that the input has R = B? Not necessarily, because the example input gives R and B separately.\n\n Correction: The problem states: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format: first line two integers R, B.\n\n Condition: If R != B, then there is no perfect matching (unless we consider partial matching, but the problem says every base must have one and every spaceship must have one). Therefore, we output 'No' when R != B.\n\n But note: the example input includes both examples. The second example is \"2 1\", so R=2, B=1 -> no.\n\n However, what if R < B or R > B? Then we cannot assign all bases or we have leftover spaceships. So indeed, we require R == B.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have two sets: S (spaceships) and B (bases). We want to assign each spaceship to a base such that the straight line segments (from each spaceship to its base) do not intersect.\n\n Since the points are in general position (no three collinear), two line segments either intersect or not.\n\n Conditions for two non-intersecting segments: \n   Given two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) (where a, b, c, d are distinct points), the segments ab and cd do not cross.\n\n However, note: the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting. But note: the condition is that any two paths (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. This means that the entire drawing (the set of segments) must be non-intersecting.\n\n How to check for non-intersecting segments?\n\n We can use the following: Two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) do not intersect if and only if the points p3 and p4 are on the same side of the line p1p2 and vice versa, but actually we can use the orientation test.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the standard method to check if two segments intersect:\n\n   def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        # returns True if segments ab and cd intersect, else False\n\n However, note: the entire set of segments must not have any intersections. We are going to assign each spaceship to a base, so we have R segments (and R=B).\n\n But note: the problem does not require the segments to be disjoint only pairwise? Actually, the condition is that any two paths do not intersect. So even if two segments share an endpoint (which they do, by the assignment: each segment is from a spaceship to a base) then note that the endpoints are distinct (because no two points coincide). So the segments only meet at endpoints? \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". This usually means that the interiors of the segments do not cross. So two segments that share an endpoint are allowed (they meet at the base or the spaceship). But note: the base and spaceship are distinct points, and the segments are from base to spaceship. So two segments that share an endpoint (like two segments from two different bases to the same spaceship) would share that endpoint. But the problem says \"paths\" (so the entire path from base to spaceship) and they are straight. \n\n However, the condition is that the two paths (segments) do not intersect. Typically, if two segments share an endpoint, we consider them to intersect at that point. But note the problem says \"in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D)\" and \"do not intersect\". In computational geometry, sometimes we consider open/closed segments. But the problem does not specify. However, the example: \n\n Example 1: \n   Spaceships: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n   Bases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\n One possible matching is to assign:\n   (0,0) -> (-2,1)\n   (2,0) -> (0,3)\n   (3,1) -> (2,2)\n\n Now, do the segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3) intersect? Let's plot:\n\n   Segment1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): goes left-up.\n   Segment2: from (2,0) to (0,3): goes left-up.\n\n They don't share endpoints and they don't cross in the interior? Actually, let me compute:\n\n   The two lines: \n        Line1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): parametric form: x = -2t, y = t, for t in [0,1] (if we consider normalized from (0,0) to (-2,1))\n        Line2: from (2,0) to (0,3): parametric form: x = 2-2s, y = 3s, for s in [0,1]\n\n   Solve: -2t = 2-2s and t = 3s -> then from t=3s, we get -2*(3s)=2-2s -> -6s=2-2s -> -4s=2 -> s=-0.5, which is outside [0,1]. So they don't intersect.\n\n But note: the example also includes the third segment (3,1) to (2,2): from (3,1) to (2,2). This segment is from (3,1) to (2,2). Does it intersect with the others? \n\n   Check with the first segment: (0,0) to (-2,1) and (3,1) to (2,2): \n        Line1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): equation: (x+2)/(-2)=y/1 -> x+2 = -2y -> x+2y = -2.\n        Line2: from (3,1) to (2,2): equation: (x-3)/(2-3)=(y-1)/(2-1) -> (x-3)/(-1)=y-1 -> x-3 = -1*(y-1) -> x+y = 4.\n\n        Solve: x+2y=-2 and x+y=4 -> subtract: y=-6, then x=10 -> not in the bounding boxes. So no intersection.\n\n   Similarly, the second segment: (2,0) to (0,3) and the third: (3,1) to (2,2): \n        Line1: (2,0) to (0,3): equation: (x-2)/(0-2)=(y-0)/(3-0) -> (x-2)/(-2)=y/3 -> 3(x-2)=-2y -> 3x-6+2y=0 -> 3x+2y=6.\n        Line2: (3,1) to (2,2): equation: x+y=4.\n\n        Solve: 3x+2y=6 and x+y=4 -> multiply the second by 2: 2x+2y=8, subtract: x=-2, then y=6 -> not in the bounding boxes.\n\n So the example is valid.\n\n However, note: the condition is that any two (meaning every pair) of the segments do not intersect. So we must check every pair of segments (for the entire matching) for intersection (considering only the interiors, i.e., excluding the endpoints? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. Typically, if two segments share an endpoint, then they are considered to intersect at that point. But the problem does not explicitly say. However, the example does not have two segments sharing an endpoint because the endpoints are distinct (each base and spaceship is used once). \n\n But wait: the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so the segments are between distinct pairs of points, and no two segments share an endpoint.\n\n Therefore, we only need to check for proper crossings (intersections in the interior).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. So if two segments cross at an interior point, that is forbidden. But if they only meet at an endpoint, that is allowed? Actually, the problem does not specify, but note the assignment: the endpoints are distinct. So two segments will never share an endpoint.\n\n Therefore, we only need to check for proper intersections (non-endpoint crossings).\n\n Algorithm:\n\n 1. If R != B, output 'No'.\n 2. Otherwise, we have a set of R spaceships (S) and R bases (B). We want to know if there exists a permutation p of [0, R-1] such that for every i, j (i != j) the segments (S_i, B_{p(i)}) and (S_j, B_{p(j)}) do not intersect.\n\n 3. We can iterate over all permutations (R! possibilities) and check the entire set of segments for any intersection.\n\n However, checking for intersections in a set of R segments: we have to check every pair. There are C(R,2) pairs. For each pair, we check if the two segments (each defined by two points) intersect (properly, i.e., not just at endpoints). \n\n But note: the segments are defined by two distinct pairs of points (from two different assignments). Since the endpoints are distinct, we can use the standard method.\n\n Standard method for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect (properly, i.e., not at endpoints) is:\n\n   We can use the orientation method and check that the points C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of the line CD.\n\n   However, note: the segments are defined by two distinct pairs of points. We can use the following:\n\n   Define a function orient(o, a, b): returns the cross product (o->a) x (o->b). Then, two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if:\n\n        o1 = orient(p1, q1, p2)\n        o2 = orient(p1, q1, q2)\n        o3 = orient(p2, q2, p1)\n        o4 = orient(p2, q2, q1)\n\n   And (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n But wait, this is the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (including at endpoints). However, we want to avoid intersections at endpoints? \n\n However, note our condition: the endpoints are distinct and we are considering two distinct segments. The endpoints of the two segments are four distinct points (by the problem: no two points coincide). So if the segments intersect at an endpoint, then that endpoint would be one of the four points. But the standard method above (with the cross products) does not distinguish between endpoint and interior. \n\n Actually, the standard method as above returns true for any crossing (even at endpoints) because the condition for being on opposite sides is broken at the endpoint. \n\n We must check for proper crossing (only interior). \n\n There are two ways:\n\n Option 1: Use the standard segment intersection test and then check that the intersection is not at an endpoint. But that is more complicated.\n\n Option 2: Since we know the four points are distinct, we can check that the segments do not share any endpoint. But wait, we are assigning distinct bases to distinct spaceships, so the endpoints are all distinct. Therefore, if the two segments (AB and CD) share an endpoint, then one of the endpoints is common. But our assignment ensures that the base points and spaceship points are distinct. However, note: the endpoints of the two segments are: (A, B) and (C, D). Since A, B, C, D are four distinct points, they cannot share an endpoint.\n\n Therefore, the standard method (which checks for any crossing, including at endpoints) is actually safe because the endpoints are distinct and we are only concerned with intersections (even if they are at endpoints, that would be a degenerate case). However, since the four points are distinct, if the segments share an endpoint then the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) would fail because one of the orientations might be zero? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n   The standard method for two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) is:\n\n        o1 = orient(p1, q1, p2)\n        o2 = orient(p1, q1, q2)\n        o3 = orient(p2, q2, p1)\n        o4 = orient(p2, q2, q1)\n\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True   # they intersect (possibly at endpoints)\n\n   But if the two segments share an endpoint, say p2 = p1, then:\n        o1 = orient(p1, q1, p1) = 0\n        o2 = orient(p1, q1, q2) = some value\n\n        Then o1 * o2 = 0, so the condition fails.\n\n   Similarly, if they share an endpoint elsewhere, one of the orientations will be zero and the condition fails.\n\n   However, note: the condition requires that the two segments are strictly on opposite sides. But if one of the points is colinear, then the condition breaks. \n\n   Since the problem states that no three points are collinear, then if the two segments share an endpoint, that endpoint is one of the four, and then the orientation at that shared endpoint (when used as the middle point) might be zero, and the condition fails. \n\n   But wait, the condition for intersection is that the two segments cross (at an interior point). The standard method actually returns true for any crossing, but note: the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) requires that p2 and q2 are on opposite sides of the line p1q1 (or one is on the line, then the product is 0). But if no three points are collinear, then none of the orientations can be zero. \n\n   Therefore, if the two segments share an endpoint, then we have three distinct points (since the endpoints are distinct and the other two are distinct) but wait: the four points are distinct, so if they share an endpoint then the two segments have one common point. But the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) would be:\n\n        Suppose the common point is p2 (which is one endpoint of the second segment). Then in the first segment, we have p1 and q1, and the second segment has p1 (common) and q2.\n\n        Then orient(p1, q1, p1) is 0 (because p1 to p1 is (0,0)) -> so o1=0, then the condition fails.\n\n   So the standard method returns false for two segments that share an endpoint (because one of the orientations is zero). \n\n   Therefore, we can use the standard method to check for any crossing (including endpoints) and then if the segments do not share an endpoint (which they don't by the problem's distinct points) then the standard method will only return true for interior crossings.\n\n   However, note: the standard method returns true for any crossing (including endpoints) if the endpoints are distinct and the four points are in general position (no three collinear) then the only way the condition holds is if the segments cross in the interior.\n\n   Actually, the standard method is designed to return true for any proper crossing (including endpoints) and false otherwise. But with the guarantee of distinct points and no three collinear, we can rely on the standard method to return true only when the two segments cross (at an interior point) and false otherwise.\n\n   However, wait: the standard method does not require the four points to be distinct? It works for any four points. And if the four points are distinct and no three collinear, then the only intersections are at interior points.\n\n   So we can use the standard method.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precondition: R = B, and all 2*R points are distinct and no three are collinear.\n\n   For a given matching (permutation of bases for the spaceships), we have R segments: for each i, the segment from spaceship S_i to base B_perm[i].\n\n   Then, we check every unordered pair (i, j) (i < j) of these segments. For each pair, we check if the two segments (segment_i and segment_j) intersect (using the standard method). If any pair intersects, then the matching is invalid.\n\n   If we find a matching where no two segments intersect, we output 'Yes'. If none of the matchings work, we output 'No'.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll write a helper function:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # returns True if segments ab and cd intersect (including endpoints? but we don't care because we know endpoints are distinct and no three collinear, so we only get true for interior crossings) \n            # But actually, the standard method also returns true for endpoints, but our condition (with distinct points and no three collinear) ensures that endpoints are distinct and the segments don't share endpoints.\n\n            # However, we want to avoid the situation where the segments share an endpoint (which doesn't happen) and we want to check for interior crossings.\n\n            # But the standard method is: \n            #   o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            #   o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n            #   o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n            #   o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n            #   if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            #       return True\n            #   else:\n            #       return False\n\n            # However, note: the standard method is sometimes written with a sign check, but the condition is that the two segments are strictly on opposite sides.\n\n            # But wait, there's another possibility: if one of the orientations is zero, then the point is colinear. But we know no three are collinear, so no orientation can be zero. Therefore, we can use:\n\n            # However, note: the standard method does not account for the case when the segments are colinear? Actually, we are guaranteed no three points are collinear, so the four points are in general position. So we can use the above.\n\n            # But note: the standard method as above is for two segments that are not necessarily having the same endpoints. Our segments are defined by distinct points.\n\n            # Let's define orient(o, a, b):\n            def orient(o, a, b):\n                # returns the cross product of vectors oa and ob\n                x1 = a[0] - o[0]\n                y1 = a[1] - o[1]\n                x2 = b[0] - o[0]\n                y2 = b[1] - o[1]\n                return x1*y2 - x2*y1\n\n            o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n            o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n            o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n            # Because no three points are collinear, o1, o2, o3, o4 are nonzero.\n            if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n\n   Then, we generate all permutations of the bases (which are R bases, so range(R)) and for each permutation:\n\n        Let matching[i] = base_index for spaceship i.\n\n        Then, we have segments: for i in range(R): (spaceship[i], base[matching[i]])\n\n        Then, we check every pair of segments (i, j) for i < j. If any pair of segments (i and j) intersect, break out and try next permutation.\n\n        If we complete the pair checking without finding an intersection, then we found a matching.\n\n   However, note: the matching is a bijection from spaceships to bases, so we are permuting the bases for the fixed list of spaceships.\n\n   But note: the order of the segments: we are going to check every pair. The segments are defined by two distinct pairs of points.\n\n   Important: The matching is a list of base indices, so the i-th spaceship is connected to the base at index matching[i].\n\n   We have to be cautious: the standard segment_intersect function takes four points: a, b, c, d. Here, the segment is from a to b and from c to d.\n\n   In our case, for the i-th segment: a = spaceship[i], b = base[matching[i]]\n   for the j-th segment: c = spaceship[j], d = base[matching[j]]\n\n   Then call segments_intersect(spaceship[i], base[matching[i]], spaceship[j], base[matching[j]]).\n\n   But note: the function expects the two segments: first segment from a to b, second from c to d.\n\n   However, the standard method is symmetric: it doesn't matter which segment is first.\n\n   We must check all pairs (i, j) for i < j.\n\n   But note: the total number of pairs is R*(R-1)//2, and R <= 10, so maximum 45 pairs per matching. And the total number of matchings is 10! = 3628800, and for each matching we do 45 checks, each check does 4 orientations (each orientation is a few arithmetic operations). So total operations: 3628800 * 45 * (some constant) -> about 163 million operations, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but 10! is 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is around 160 million. In Python, each operation is a few integer multiplications, so let's assume 10 operations per orientation (actually 4*4=16 operations per segment pair). Then total operations: 160 million * 16 = 2.56e9 operations? That might be too slow in pure Python.\n\n   We need to optimize.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a smarter way: if we fix the matching, we can check the entire set of segments for non-intersection by using a sweep-line and checking for crossings, but that is more complex.\n\n   Or, we can use a different representation: we can use the fact that the non-intersection condition is equivalent to the matching being non-crossing. There is a known fact: the set of non-crossing perfect matchings in the plane (with given points) can be enumerated by a recursive method (like triangulation) but that is complicated.\n\n   Another idea: use the property that the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting. This is similar to matching parentheses or planar graphs.\n\n   However, given the small constraints (R<=10), we can use the brute-force with some optimizations.\n\n   But wait: 10! is 3628800, and we have to check 45 pairs per matching. 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed. However, note that the problem says R, B <= 10, so worst-case 10, and 10! is 3628800, which is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize the inner loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break early: if we find one intersecting pair, we break and move to the next matching.\n\n   But worst-case, we still do 45 checks for each matching until we find one that is good. The worst-case is that the last matching is the correct one, so we do 3628800 * 45 checks.\n\n   Let me calculate: 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is 163 million. In Python, each check involves 4 orientations (each orientation is 2 subtractions and 2 multiplications and one subtraction). So 8 operations per orientation, and 4 orientations: 32 operations per segment pair. Then 163 million * 32 = 5.2 billion operations. This might be too slow in Python.\n\n   We need a better way.\n\n   Alternative approach: use recursion with backtracking and prune as soon as we see an intersection. However, the problem is that we have to check the entire matching for non-intersection. But we can check the condition incrementally: when we assign a base to a spaceship, we check the new segment against all the previously assigned segments. Then, if we detect an intersection at any time, we backtrack.\n\n   Steps for backtracking:\n\n        We have two lists: S (spaceships) and B (bases).\n\n        We want to assign each spaceship to a base.\n\n        We can process the spaceships in a fixed order (say, increasing index). For the current spaceship, try every base that hasn't been used.\n\n        After assigning, check the new segment (from current spaceship to the chosen base) against all the previously assigned segments (from previous spaceships to their bases). If any intersection is found, we backtrack. Otherwise, proceed.\n\n        Then, if we assign all spaceships without any intersection, we return 'Yes'.\n\n        If we try all possibilities and none works, return 'No'.\n\n   Why is this valid? Because the condition must hold for every pair. We are building the matching one by one, and we check at each step that the new segment does not intersect any of the previously drawn segments.\n\n   This reduces the number of checks: for the k-th spaceship (0-indexed, k from 0 to R-1), we check k segments. So total checks: 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (R-1) = R*(R-1)//2, same as before. But the difference is that we stop early when an intersection is found.\n\n   However, worst-case, we still have to check all permutations. But the average might be better because we break as soon as an intersection occurs.\n\n   But worst-case (if the matching is the last one) we still do the same amount of checks.\n\n   However, we can also use the fact that the non-intersection condition is independent of the order of assignment? Actually, the order of assignment does not change the set of segments, but we are breaking the matching into an ordering of the spaceships.\n\n   We can choose the order of spaceships arbitrarily. We'll fix an order (say, by their coordinates, or just by index).\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the order, so we can choose an order that might help in pruning. For example, if we sort the spaceships by x-coordinate, then we might catch intersections earlier.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following observation: the set of non-intersecting matchings is independent of the order, but the backtracking order might affect the speed.\n\n   We can implement the backtracking with recursion and memoization? But the state space is the set of used bases, which is 2^R, and we have R up to 10, so 2^10=1024 states. But we are building a matching, and the state is the set of bases used so far (and the spaceship index). We can use DP with state (mask) of base usage. But note: the condition depends on the actual segments, not just the mask. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a recursive function that assigns bases to the first spaceship, then to the second, etc., and checks the new segment against the already assigned segments.\n\n   Steps for backtracking:\n\n        def backtrack(i): # i: current spaceship index (0-indexed) we are going to assign\n            if i == R:\n                return True\n\n            for each base j not used:\n                assign base j to spaceship i.\n                Check the segment from spaceship[i] to base[j] against all previously assigned segments (from spaceship[k] to base[matching[k]] for k in range(i)).\n\n                If the segment does not intersect any of the previous segments, then continue to assign the next spaceship.\n\n            If we found one, return True, else return False.\n\n        But wait, how do we store the matching? We need to remember which base is assigned to which spaceship. But we can pass the set of used bases and the list of assigned segments (or just the list of base indices for the first i spaceships). However, the check for the new segment requires the entire set of previously assigned segments (their endpoints). \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the entire set of segments for the matching so far. But then we have to store the entire matching.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            used_bases = set()\n            matching = []   # or we can use a list of length R, initially None.\n\n            Then for spaceship i, we try every base j not in used_bases.\n\n            Then, we check the new segment (spaceship[i], base[j]) against all the segments for k in range(i): (spaceship[k], base[matching[k]]).\n\n            Then, if no intersection, mark base j as used and matching[i]=j, and recurse.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            def backtrack(i, used, matching_list):\n                if i == R:\n                    return True\n                for j in range(R):\n                    if j not in used:\n                        # create a new segment: (spaceship[i], base[j])\n                        new_seg = (ships[i], bases[j])\n                        # check new_seg against all segments in matching_list (which are for k from 0 to i-1)\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in matching_list:\n                            if segments_intersect(new_seg[0], new_seg[1], seg[0], seg[1]):\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                        if valid:\n                            used_new = used | {j}\n                            matching_list_new = matching_list + [new_seg]\n                            if backtrack(i+1, used_new, matching_list_new):\n                                return True\n                return False\n\n        But note: the matching_list is a list of segments (each segment is a tuple of two points). We are storing the entire history.\n\n        However, we can avoid storing the entire history by using the original lists for spaceships and bases and just storing the base assignment for each spaceship (the matching). Then we can reconstruct the segments.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the matching as a list of base indices (the base for each spaceship). Then the k-th segment is (ships[k], bases[matching[k]]). Then the check for the new segment (at index i) is against the segments for k=0 to i-1.\n\n        Let me restructure:\n\n            We have:\n                ships = list of R points (each point is (x, y))\n                bases = list of R points (each point is (x, y))\n\n            We maintain:\n                matching = [None]*R   # base indices assigned to each spaceship\n\n            Then, in the backtracking, we assign for spaceship i a base j (that is not used). Then the segment for spaceship i is (ships[i], bases[j]). Then we check this segment against the segments for all k from 0 to i-1: (ships[k], bases[matching[k]]).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            def backtrack(i):\n                if i == R:\n                    return True\n                for j in range(R):\n                    if matching[i] is None:   # we are going to try base j for spaceship i\n                        # But wait, we haven't set matching[i] yet. Alternatively, we can use a list of base indices for the first i spaceships, and then we know the segments for the first i-1.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n            matching = [-1] * R   # -1 means not assigned\n\n            def backtrack(i):\n                if i == R:\n                    return True\n                for j in range(R):\n                    if matching[i] == -1:   # we are processing spaceship i, and we try base j that is not assigned to any spaceship (but note: we must ensure base j is not used by a later spaceship? Actually, we are building the matching, so we need to check that base j is available. But we are assigning one base per spaceship. We can keep an array of base usage.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use an array `used` for bases (boolean) and update it.\n\n            But we have two choices: we can use a list `used_bases` (boolean) of length R, and update it.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n            used_bases = [False] * R\n            matching = [-1] * R\n\n            def backtrack(i):\n                if i == R:\n                    return True\n                for j in range(R):\n                    if not used_bases[j]:\n                        # Check the new segment (ships[i], bases[j]) against all segments for k from 0 to i-1 (spaceships 0 to i-1) that are already assigned (and hence have matching[k] != -1)\n\n                        # But note: we are building the matching from 0 to R-1. For spaceship k (k < i) we have matching[k] != -1, and the base index is matching[k] (which is j0, j1, ...). But wait, we stored the base index, so the segment for spaceship k is (ships[k], bases[matching[k]]). \n\n                        # However, we must check the new segment (ships[i], bases[j]) against the existing segments (for k from 0 to i-1).\n\n                        # But note: the existing segments are stored in the bases by the matching[k] index.\n\n                        valid = True\n                        # Check against all k in range(i) (spaceships 0 to i-1)\n                        for k in range(i):\n                            # segment k: (ships[k], bases[matching[k]])\n                            # segment i: (ships[i], bases[j])\n                            if segments_intersect(ships[k], bases[matching[k]], ships[i], bases[j]):\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n\n                        if valid:\n                            used_bases[j] = True\n                            matching[i] = j\n                            if backtrack(i+1):\n                                return True\n                            used_bases[j] = False\n                            matching[i] = -1\n\n                return False\n\n        Then, if backtrack(0) is True, output 'Yes', else 'No'\n\n   But note: the base j is an index into the bases list, and the matching stores the base index for spaceship i.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the `segments_intersect` function we defined earlier uses four points. We have:\n\n        segments_intersect(a, b, c, d): \n            returns True if the segments ab and cd intersect (properly, including endpoints? but we have distinct points so endpoints are distinct, and no three collinear, so we only get true for interior crossings)\n\n   But wait: the standard method returns true for endpoints if they are colinear, but we know no three collinear, so if the segments share an endpoint then one orientation is zero and the condition fails. But our segments are from distinct points, so they don't share endpoints. Therefore, the condition is safe.\n\n   However, note: the standard method might also return true for improper intersections (if the segments are degenerate, but we have distinct points). \n\n   But wait: the standard method is known to work for non-degenerate cases. \n\n   Let me test the standard method with two segments that share an endpoint: \n        a = (0,0), b=(1,0), c=(1,0), d=(2,0) -> wait, then we have two distinct segments but they share an endpoint (b and c are the same point). Then the four points are (0,0), (1,0), (1,0), (2,0). But our problem states that no two points coincide, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   So we can use the standard method.\n\n   However, note: the standard method may not be the most efficient, but R<=10,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between spaceships and bases for non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (each spaceship assigned to exactly one base and vice versa) where the connecting segments between any two pairs do not intersect. Given the constraints (R and B up to 10), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution leverages backtracking to explore all possible matchings. For each spaceship, it tries every available base, checks if the new segment intersects any previously drawn segments, and proceeds recursively if no intersections are found.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The backtracking algorithm is chosen for its ability to systematically explore all possible matchings while pruning invalid paths early. The standard computational geometry method for checking segment intersections is used to verify non-intersection conditions.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(R! * R^2), where R is the number of spaceships (up to 10). This is manageable due to the small constraint on R.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    ships = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def orient(o, a, b):\n        x1 = a[0] - o[0]\n        y1 = a[1] - o[1]\n        x2 = b[0] - o[0]\n        y2 = b[1] - o[1]\n        return x1*y2 - x2*y1\n\n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    used_bases = [False] * R\n    matching = [-1] * R\n\n    def backtrack(i):\n        if i == R:\n            return True\n            \n        for j in range(R):\n            if not used_bases[j]:\n                valid = True\n                for k in range(i):\n                    seg1 = (ships[k], bases[matching[k]])\n                    seg2 = (ships[i], bases[j])\n                    if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if valid:\n                    used_bases[j] = True\n                    matching[i] = j\n                    if backtrack(i+1):\n                        return True\n                    used_bases[j] = False\n                    matching[i] = -1\n                    \n        return False\n\n    if backtrack(0):\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into integers R and B (number of spaceships and bases, respectively).

For each assignment, it checks if the new segment intersects any previously assigned segments. If no intersections are found, it proceeds to the next spaceship; otherwise, it backtracks.\n4. **Output**: If a valid matching is found during the backtracking process, \"Yes\" is printed; otherwise, \"No\" is printed after all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible matchings while leveraging early termination to optimize performance, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
