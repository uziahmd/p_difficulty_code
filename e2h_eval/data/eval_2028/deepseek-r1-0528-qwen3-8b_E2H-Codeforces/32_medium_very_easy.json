    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the current minimum or maximum (or both) if that element was the unique minimum or maximum.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` of size n, and let:\n   min_val = min(a)\n   max_val = max(a)\n\n After removing one element, the new array's min and max will be:\n   If we remove an element x, then:\n      new_min = min_val if x != min_val, otherwise the next smallest value (but note: there might be duplicates)\n      new_max = max_val if x != max_val, otherwise the next largest value.\n\n However, note that if we remove an element that is not the minimum, the minimum remains the same? Not necessarily: if there are multiple minima, then removing one doesn't change the minimum. Similarly for the maximum.\n\n But note: the problem allows duplicates.\n\n Alternate approach:\n Since we are allowed to remove exactly one element, we can consider the effect of removing each candidate for removal.\n\n However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try every removal and compute the entire min and max (which would be O(n^2)).\n\n Instead, we can precompute:\n   Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n   Then the overall min is sorted_a[0] and max is sorted_a[-1].\n\n When we remove an element, the new min and max are determined by the remaining elements.\n\n Consider: \n   The new array's min will be at least the original min (if we remove the min, then the new min becomes the next smallest).\n   Similarly, the new array's max will be at most the original max.\n\n Actually, the instability after removal is: (max of the remaining) - (min of the remaining)\n\n We can think: \n   If we remove an element that is the global minimum, then the new minimum is the next smallest element (if exists) in the array, which is sorted_a[1] (if we remove one occurrence of the minimum). But note: what if there are multiple minimums? Then even if we remove one minimum, there might be another minimum, so the new min is still the original min. \n\n So we need to account for the frequency of the min and max.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element.\n\n We can consider two types of removals that might yield a lower instability:\n\n 1. Removal of an element that is the current minimum (if it is the unique minimum, then the new min increases; if there are duplicates, then the new min remains the same until we remove all duplicates of the min).\n 2. Removal of an element that is the current maximum (similarly).\n\n But note: sometimes the best removal might be somewhere in the middle?\n\n Let's break down:\n\n The instability of the entire array is max_val - min_val.\n\n Removing an element might help in two ways:\n   - If we remove the min, then the new min is the next smallest (if the removed min was the only one) or remains the same (if there are duplicates). Similarly for the max.\n\n However, note that the instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n We can consider the following possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove the global minimum (if we remove one occurrence of the global minimum, then the new min is the next smallest value, unless there are multiple global minima). Similarly for the global maximum.\n\n But note: the goal is to minimize the instability (max - min). \n\n What if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains (max_val - min_val). \n\n So the minimal instability must be less than or equal to (max_val - min_val). Therefore, we should consider removals that either increase the min or decrease the max.\n\n Specifically, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove an element that is the global min. Then the new min becomes the next smallest value (which is the second distinct minimum). Then the instability becomes (max_val - next_min).\n\n Option 2: Remove an element that is the global max. Then the new max becomes the previous largest value (the second distinct maximum). Then the instability becomes (next_max - min_val).\n\n However, note: there might be multiple copies of the min and max. \n\n Example: [1, 1, 3, 7]\n   Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n   Removing one 1: then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6 (same as before).\n   Removing the other 1: same result.\n\n But wait, what if we have [1, 1, 3, 7] and remove the 3? Then [1,1,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n   Removing the 7: [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n So we see that sometimes removing an element that is not the min or max might help? Actually no: because the min and max remain the same (unless we remove the max or min). In this example, removing the 7 (max) helps.\n\n Another example: [1, 3, 3, 7] (as in the example input). Removing 7: [1,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n Now consider: [1, 2, 3, 4] \n   Original instability = 3.\n   Removing 1: [2,3,4] -> instability=2.\n   Removing 4: [1,2,3] -> instability=2.\n   Removing 2: [1,3,4] -> instability=3.\n   Removing 3: [1,2,4] -> instability=3.\n\n So the best is 2.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We note that the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n   candidate1: (max_val - next_min)   [where next_min is the smallest value in the array that is greater than min_val, but wait: actually, if we remove one min, then the new min is the smallest value that is not the min_val? Not exactly: if there are multiple min_vals, then removing one min_val leaves others, so the min remains min_val. Only when we remove the last min_val does the min increase.\n\n Actually, we don't know which removal will change the min. We need to know the next smallest value if we remove one occurrence of the min. But note: if there are k copies of min_val, then we can remove at most k-1 copies and the min remains min_val. Only when we remove the k-th copy, the min becomes the next smallest.\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n However, we are allowed to remove exactly one element. So:\n\n   Let:\n     Let left = sorted(a)\n     Then the next_min after removal of one min is:\n        If the first element appears only once, then next_min = left[1] (because we remove one occurrence, and the next smallest is left[1]).\n        But if the first element appears multiple times, then even after removing one occurrence, the min remains left[0]. So then the min doesn't change.\n\n But wait, we are considering the scenario of removing one element. We are allowed to remove one element arbitrarily.\n\n Actually, we can consider two strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: Remove an element that is the minimum. Then the new min is:\n        If the minimum occurs only once, then the new min is the next smallest (left[1]).\n        If the minimum occurs more than once, then the new min is still the minimum (left[0]).\n\n Strategy 2: Remove an element that is the maximum. Then the new max is:\n        If the maximum occurs only once, then the new max is the next largest (left[-2]).\n        If the maximum occurs more than once, then the new max is still the maximum (left[-1]).\n\n But note: there are other strategies. We might remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, but that might not change the min or max. However, the goal is to minimize the instability. \n\n However, note: the instability is the difference between the max and min. If we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max remain unchanged, so the instability remains (max_val - min_val). Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve must be at most (max_val - min_val), and we can only improve upon that by removing the min or the max (or both?).\n\n But wait: sometimes removing an element that is not the min or max might actually help? Let me think:\n\n Consider: [1, 2, 100, 101]\n   Original: min=1, max=101, instability=100.\n   Removing 100: then [1,2,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> instability=100.\n   Removing 2: then [1,100,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> instability=100.\n\n So no improvement by removing non-extremes.\n\n However, consider: [1, 10, 100, 1000]\n   Removing 10: [1,100,1000] -> min=1, max=1000 -> instability=999 (worse)\n   Removing 1000: [1,10,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> instability=99 (better than 999, but still worse than the original? Actually the original was 999, so 99 is better, but note: we can also remove 1: [10,100,1000] -> min=10, max=1000 -> 990, which is worse than 99. And remove 100: [1,10,1000] -> min=1, max=1000 -> 999.\n\n So the best is removing 1000, which gives 99.\n\n But note: we can also consider removing the minimum (1) and maximum (1000) separately.\n\n Actually, we can break down the removals:\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   Case 1: Remove an element that is the minimum (and it's the only occurrence) -> then new_min = next_min (the second smallest)\n   Case 2: Remove an element that is the maximum (and it's the only occurrence) -> then new_max = next_max (the second largest)\n\n   But note: what if we remove an element that is the minimum but there are duplicates? Then the min remains the same, so the instability becomes (max_val - min_val) [same as before] or maybe even worse if we remove a non-minimum element? Actually, if we remove a duplicate minimum, the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same. Similarly for maximum.\n\n   Therefore, the only chance to improve the instability is by removing the minimum (if it is the only occurrence) or the maximum (if it is the only occurrence). But wait, what if the array has multiple minima and maxima?\n\n   Example: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n     Original: min=1, max=4, instability=3.\n     Removing one 1: the min remains 1, so instability is 4-1=3.\n     Removing one 3: the max remains 4, so instability is 3.\n     Removing 2: then min=1, max=4 -> 3.\n     Removing 4: then max becomes 3, so instability=3-1=2.\n\n   So we see that removing the maximum (even if there are duplicates) can help if the maximum is the only occurrence? Actually, in this example, the maximum 4 appears once, so removing it sets the new max to 3.\n\n   But what if we remove a minimum that is duplicated? Then the min doesn't change. Similarly, if we remove a maximum that is duplicated, then the max doesn't change.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   Let:\n      left = sorted(a)\n      min_val = left[0]\n      max_val = left[-1]\n\n   Then, the instability if we remove an element that is the minimum and it's the only occurrence of min_val is: (max_val - left[1])\n   But if there are multiple min_vals, then even after removal the min remains min_val, so the instability is (max_val - min_val) (same as original).\n\n   Similarly, for the maximum: \n        If we remove an occurrence of max_val and it's the only occurrence, then the new max is left[-2], so instability is (left[-2] - min_val)\n        Otherwise, the instability remains (max_val - min_val).\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove a min or max. But we just argued that removing a non-min or non-max element leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n        candidate1: (max_val - min_val)   [this is the original instability, but we are not forced to remove min or max, but if we do remove a non-min/max then we get this, and if we remove min or max we get something else]\n\n        candidate2: (max_val - next_min)   [if we remove the minimum and it was the only occurrence, then next_min is the next distinct value? Actually, no: we remove one occurrence of the min, but if there are multiple min_vals, then the min remains the same. So we must consider the next smallest distinct value only when the min is unique?]\n\n   Actually, we must consider:\n\n   Possibility 1: Removing an element that is the minimum (and there is at least one occurrence of min_val). Then the new min is:\n        If the count of min_val is 1, then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the smallest value that is >= min_val, i.e., left[1]).\n        Else (count>1), the new min is still min_val.\n\n   Similarly, Possibility 2: Removing an element that is the maximum (and there is at least one occurrence of max_val). Then the new max is:\n        If the count of max_val is 1, then the new max is the next largest (left[-2]).\n        Else, the new max is max_val.\n\n   But note: we can also remove an element that is neither the min nor the max. Then the min and max remain, so the instability is (max_val - min_val).\n\n   However, we are looking for the minimum instability.\n\n   So the candidates are:\n\n     candidate1 = (max_val - min_val)   [removing an element that is neither min nor max, or if removal of min or max doesn't change the min or max]\n\n     candidate2 = (max_val - (min_val if count_min>1 else left[1]))   [if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the new min is (min_val if count_min>1 else left[1]), so the instability is (max_val - new_min)]\n        But wait, if we remove the min, then the max remains max_val (unless we remove the max too? No, we remove one element). So the candidate2 is computed with the same max (max_val) and the new min.\n\n     candidate3 = ((max_val if count_max>1 else left[-2]) - min_val)   [if we remove one occurrence of the max, then the new max is (max_val if count_max>1 else left[-2]), so the instability is (new_max - min_val)]\n\n   However, note: we can also remove an element that is the min and also the max (if the array is constant)? Then we have to consider both.\n\n   Example: [1,1,1] \n        n=3, min_val=1, max_val=1, count_min=3, count_max=3.\n        Removing one element: the array becomes [1,1] -> instability=0.\n\n        candidate1: (1-1)=0.\n        candidate2: (1 - (1 if count_min>1 else ...)) -> since count_min=3>1, new_min=1 -> (1-1)=0.\n        candidate3: (1 - 1)=0.\n\n        So the answer is 0.\n\n   But note: we can also consider that the array might have both min and max being the same (constant array). Then any removal leads to the same min and max (if n>=2, then after removal we have at least two elements, but they are all the same).\n\n   However, we must note: the above candidate2 and candidate3 are computed independently. But we are allowed to remove only one element, so we can consider:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min>1 else left[1]))\n        candidate_remove_max = ((max_val if count_max>1 else left[-2]) - min_val)\n\n        candidate_remove_other = (max_val - min_val)\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum of candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_remove_other.\n\n   But wait: candidate_remove_other is the same as the original, and we are already considering candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max which might be lower.\n\n   However, note: candidate_remove_other is not a distinct possibility from candidate_remove_min or candidate_remove_max? Actually, if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is (max_val - min_val). But if we remove the min (even if it's duplicated) then the instability is (max_val - min_val) (same as original) and similarly for the max.\n\n   Therefore, the three candidates are:\n\n        candidate1 = (max_val - min_val)   [this is the result of removing an element that is not the min and not the max, OR if the min or max is duplicated and we remove one occurrence of it]\n\n        candidate2 = (max_val - next_min)   [only if the min is unique, then next_min = left[1]; if the min is not unique, then candidate2 is not applicable because removing one min doesn't change the min, so we don't get a better candidate? Actually, if the min is duplicated, then candidate2 is (max_val - min_val) which is candidate1]\n\n        candidate3 = (next_max - min_val)   [only if the max is unique, then next_max = left[-2]; if duplicated, then candidate3 is (max_val - min_val) which is candidate1]\n\n   But note: we want the minimum instability. So we can simply compute:\n\n        ans = min( \n            (max_val - min_val),           # This is the base case (removing an element that doesn't change the min or max, or if we remove a min or max that is duplicated then the min/max remains the same)\n            (max_val - (min_val if count_min > 1 else left[1])), \n            ((left[-2] if count_max == 1 else max_val) - min_val)\n        )\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has only two elements?\n        Example: [1, 2]\n          n=2, sorted=[1,2]\n          min_val=1, max_val=2, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n          candidate1: 2-1=1.\n          candidate2: (2 - (if count_min==1 then left[1]=2? but wait, left[1] is 2, so 2-2=0) -> but wait, that's incorrect.\n\n   Let me reexamine: when we remove the min from [1,2] (which is 1), then the remaining array is [2]. The min and max of [2] is 2. So instability=0.\n\n   But according to our candidate2: \n        candidate2 = (max_val - (min_val if count_min>1 else left[1]))\n        count_min=1, so use left[1] which is 2 -> 2-2=0.\n\n   Similarly, candidate3: \n        candidate3 = (left[-2] if count_max==1 else max_val) - min_val\n        left[-2] is 1, so (1-1)=0.\n\n   Then ans = min(1, 0, 0) = 0.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the two-element array, if we remove the min, then the array has one element. The instability of a single element is defined as max - min, which is 0.\n\n   However, the problem says: the resulting (n-1)-elements array. For n=2, n-1=1. So yes, the array has one element, and the instability is 0.\n\n   But in the above formula for candidate2, we used left[1] (which is the next smallest) for the new min. However, when we remove the min, the array has one element (the max) so the min and max are both that element. Our candidate2 calculation is correct because the new min is the next smallest, which in the two-element case is the max, and then the instability is (max_val - new_min) = 2-2=0.\n\n   However, note: in the two-element array, if we remove the min, the next smallest is the max, which is the only element left.\n\n   But consider a three-element array: [1,2,3] (sorted)\n        Removing the min (1): the remaining array is [2,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> instability=1.\n        candidate2: (3 - (min_val if count_min>1 else left[1])) = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\n   So the formula holds.\n\n   However, there is a catch: what if the array has duplicates and the min is duplicated, then the next_min is still the min (so candidate2 = (max_val - min_val))? But we are not forced to remove the min. We are considering the effect of removing the min. But if the min is duplicated, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains (max_val - min_val). And that is candidate1.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        sorted_a = sorted(a)\n        min_val = sorted_a[0]\n        max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n\n        count_min = number of times min_val appears in a\n        count_max = number of times max_val appears in a\n\n        candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min > 1 else sorted_a[1])) \n        candidate_remove_max = ((sorted_a[-2] if count_max == 1 else max_val) - min_val)\n\n        candidate_other = (max_val - min_val)\n\n        ans = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_other)\n\n   But wait, candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max might be negative? No, because min_val <= max_val, and if we remove the min, then the new min is at least min_val (if count_min>1) or greater (if count_min==1, then sorted_a[1] >= min_val). Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, note: what if the array has only two elements and they are equal? [2,2]\n        min_val=2, max_val=2, count_min=2, count_max=2.\n        candidate_remove_min = (2 - (2 if count_min>1 else sorted_a[1])) -> but sorted_a[1] is 2, so 2-2=0.\n        candidate_remove_max = (if count_max==1? no, so use max_val (2) - min_val (2) = 0.\n        candidate_other = 0.\n\n        Then answer=0.\n\n   But the array [2,2] has two elements. Removing one element leaves [2] -> instability 0.\n\n   Another edge: array of two distinct numbers: [1,2] -> as above, works.\n\n   However, what if the array has more than two elements and the min is duplicated? \n        Example: [1,1,2,3] \n          min_val=1, max_val=3, count_min=2, count_max=1.\n          candidate_remove_min = (3 - 1) = 2   [because count_min>1, so we use min_val=1 for the new min] -> instability 2.\n          candidate_remove_max = ( (3 if count_max>1 else sorted_a[-2]) - 1 ) -> count_max=1, so use sorted_a[-2]=2 -> 2-1=1.\n          candidate_other = 3-1=2.\n\n          Then ans = min(2,1,2) = 1.\n\n        Now, what happens if we remove the max (3) from [1,1,2,3]? \n          Array becomes [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1. Correct.\n\n        What if we remove a min (one of the 1's)? Then array becomes [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n        So the best is 1.\n\n   But wait, what if we remove the element 2 (which is neither min nor max)? \n        Array becomes [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n   So the above candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_other cover the cases.\n\n   However, note: candidate_remove_min is defined as the instability if we remove one occurrence of the min. But we are allowed to remove any one element. We are considering three possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the min (if there is at least one min). Then the instability is (max_val - (min_val if count_min>1 else sorted_a[1])).\n        Possibility 2: Remove an element that is the max (if there is at least one max). Then the instability is ((max_val if count_max>1 else sorted_a[-2]) - min_val).\n        Possibility 3: Remove an element that is neither (then the instability is (max_val - min_val)).\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove one element. We are not forced to remove a min or max. However, the above three possibilities are the only ones that can occur:\n\n        - If we remove a min (if exists) -> candidate_remove_min\n        - If we remove a max (if exists) -> candidate_remove_max\n        - If we remove an element that is neither -> candidate_other\n\n   However, what if the array has an element that is both min and max? (i.e., constant array) Then we are effectively removing the min and the max at the same time. But our candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max are computed independently. But note: in a constant array, the min and max are the same, so:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min>1 else sorted_a[1])) \n        Since count_min>1 (at least 2) because n>=2, then we use min_val, so candidate_remove_min = (max_val - min_val) = 0.\n\n        candidate_remove_max = ( (max_val if count_max>1 else sorted_a[-2]) - min_val) \n        Since count_max>1, then (max_val - min_val)=0.\n\n        candidate_other = (max_val - min_val)=0.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n.\n        Step 2: Read the list of n integers.\n        Step 3: Sort the list.\n        Step 4: Find min_val = sorted_list[0], max_val = sorted_list[-1].\n        Step 5: Count the frequency of min_val and max_val.\n\n        However, note: we don't need the full frequency counts. We can check:\n\n            count_min = 1 if (sorted_list[0] != sorted_list[1]) else (we don't know from sorted_list alone without scanning the whole array? Actually, we can count the frequency of min_val and max_val.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            count_min = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n\n        Similarly for count_max.\n\n        But note: n can be up to 10^5, and we are already sorting (O(n log n)). Counting min and max is O(n). But that's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can get the frequency of min_val and max_val from the sorted array:\n\n            To count min_val: \n                We can use: \n                    from bisect import bisect_right\n                    count_min = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_a, min_val) - bisect.bisect_left(sorted_a, min_val)\n\n            Similarly for max_val.\n\n        But the problem constraints are 10^5, so we can do:\n\n            count_min = sorted_a.count(min_val)   # But note: list.count is O(n) and we are already doing a sort. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Actually, we have the sorted list. We can do:\n\n            count_min = 1\n            i = 1\n            while i < n and sorted_a[i] == min_val:\n                count_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n        Similarly for max_val, but from the end.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid counting the entire array by using:\n\n            count_min = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if a[i] == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n\n        But we already have the sorted array. Let me do:\n\n            count_min = 1\n            j = 1\n            while j < n and sorted_a[j] == min_val:\n                count_min += 1\n                j += 1\n\n            count_max = 1\n            j = n-2\n            while j>=0 and sorted_a[j] == max_val:\n                count_max += 1\n                j -= 1\n\n        But note: the array might be large, and we are only doing two linear scans (each worst-case n) but n is 10^5, so that's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also use:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n            counts = Counter(a)\n            count_min = counts[min_val]\n            count_max = counts[max_val]\n\n        This is also O(n) and simple.\n\n        Since the problem is up to 10^5, and we are reading the entire array, we can do:\n\n        Option A (without extra imports):\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            sorted_a = sorted(a)\n            min_val = sorted_a[0]\n            max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n\n            # Count min_val and max_val\n            count_min = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n\n            count_max = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == max_val:\n                    count_max += 1\n\n        Option B (using Counter from collections, but the problem doesn't require external libraries, and we can use standard Python)\n\n        But note: the problem is competitive programming and we can use standard libraries.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\" and \"efficient\", so we choose the simpler method.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            count_min = a.count(min_val)\n            count_max = a.count(max_val)\n\n        This is two passes over the array (each O(n)), so total 2n.\n\n        But we have the sorted array, so we can also use:\n\n            # For min_val: \n            #   We know the sorted array, so we can do:\n            #       count_min = 1\n            #       idx = 1\n            #       while idx < n and sorted_a[idx] == min_val:\n            #           count_min += 1\n            #           idx += 1\n\n            # Similarly for max_val.\n\n        This is one pass for min and one pass for max (each from the beginning and the end of the sorted array).\n\n        I'll choose the sorted array scan for min and max because we already have the sorted array and it's contiguous.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            sorted_a = sorted(a)\n            min_val = sorted_a[0]\n            max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n\n            # Count min_val in sorted_a (from the beginning)\n            count_min = 1\n            i = 1\n            while i < len(sorted_a) and sorted_a[i] == min_val:\n                count_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n            # Count max_val in sorted_a (from the end)\n            count_max = 1\n            i = len(sorted_a)-2\n            while i>=0 and sorted_a[i] == max_val:\n                count_max += 1\n                i -= 1\n\n        Then compute:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min > 1 else sorted_a[1]))\n            candidate_remove_max = ((sorted_a[-1] if count_max > 1 else (sorted_a[-2] if len(sorted_a)>=2 else sorted_a[-1])) - min_val)\n\n        Wait, what if the array has only one element? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry about n=1.\n\n        However, note: if the array has two elements, then sorted_a[1] exists and sorted_a[-2] exists.\n\n        But if the array has two elements, then when removing the min, we use sorted_a[1] (which is the next element). Similarly for the max.\n\n        However, what if we remove the min and the array has two elements? Then the new array has one element. Then the min and max are the same (the remaining element). Then the instability is 0.\n\n        Our formula for candidate_remove_min: \n            If we remove the min (and the min is unique) then the new min is sorted_a[1] (which is the only element left) and the max is max_val (which is the same as sorted_a[1] in the two-element case? Actually, no: if the two elements are distinct, then max_val = sorted_a[1] and min_val = sorted_a[0]. Then candidate_remove_min = (max_val - sorted_a[1]) = sorted_a[1] - sorted_a[1] = 0.\n\n        Similarly, candidate_remove_max = ( (if count_max==1 then sorted_a[-2] else max_val) - min_val) \n            In two-element distinct: count_max=1, so use sorted_a[-2] = sorted_a[0] (since n=2, index -2 is 0) -> then (sorted_a[0] - min_val) = min_val - min_val = 0.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has two identical elements? [2,2] (n=2)\n            min_val=2, max_val=2, count_min=2, count_max=2.\n            candidate_remove_min = (2 - (2 if count_min>1 else sorted_a[1])) -> since count_min>1, use 2 -> 0.\n            candidate_remove_max = ( (2 if count_max>1 else sorted_a[-2]) - 2) -> since count_max>1, use 2 -> 0.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: if the array has two elements and they are the same, then sorted_a[1] is 2, so if we were to use the 'else' part (when count_min==1) then we would use sorted_a[1]=2, which is the same as min_val. But in that case, we don't use the else part because count_min>1.\n\n        But what if the array has more than two elements and we remove the min (and there are duplicates) then the new min is still min_val. Then the instability is (max_val - min_val). Similarly for the max.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min > 1 else sorted_a[1]))\n            candidate_remove_max = ((sorted_a[-1] if count_max > 1 else sorted_a[-2]) - min_val)\n\n        But wait: what if we remove the min and the array has more than two elements and the min is unique? Then the new min is sorted_a[1]. And the max is still max_val. So the instability is (max_val - sorted_a[1]).\n\n        Similarly, if we remove the max and it is unique, then the new max is sorted_a[-2], and the min is still min_val, so instability is (sorted_a[-2] - min_val).\n\n        However, note: what if the array has only two elements and we remove the min (which is unique)? Then the new min is sorted_a[1] (which is the only element) and the max is max_val (which is sorted_a[1]). So (max_val - sorted_a[1]) = 0.\n\n        But wait, if we remove the min (and it is unique) from a two-element array, the array becomes [max_val] (one element). The instability of a one-element array is 0.\n\n        Our formula for candidate_remove_min: (max_val - sorted_a[1]) = (max_val - max_val) = 0.\n\n        Similarly for candidate_remove_max.\n\n        But what if the array has three elements: [1,2,3] (min=1, max=3, and both are unique). Then:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (3 - 2) = 1\n            candidate_remove_max = (2 - 1) = 1\n            candidate_other = 3-1=2\n\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n        This matches the example above.\n\n        One more example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that removing an element can only affect the instability if the element being removed is either the current minimum or maximum of the array. If the removed element is the only occurrence of the minimum or maximum, the new minimum or maximum will adjust accordingly. Otherwise, the instability remains unchanged.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the new minimum or maximum after removing any element. The solution involves checking three scenarios:\n   - Removing the minimum element (if it's unique, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element).\n   - Removing the maximum element (if it's unique, the new maximum becomes the next largest element).\n   - Removing any other element (instability remains the same as the original array).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - Count the occurrences of the minimum and maximum elements to determine if their removal affects the instability.\n   - Calculate the potential instability for each scenario and choose the minimum value among them.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and counting the occurrences of the minimum and maximum elements takes O(n) time. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    min_val = sorted_a[0]\n    max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n    \n    count_min = 1\n    i = 1\n    while i < len(sorted_a) and sorted_a[i] == min_val:\n        count_min += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    count_max = 1\n    i = len(sorted_a) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and sorted_a[i] == max_val:\n        count_max += 1\n        i -= 1\n        \n    candidate_remove_min = (max_val - (min_val if count_min > 1 else sorted_a[1]))\n    candidate_remove_max = ((sorted_a[-1] if count_max > 1 else sorted_a[-2]) - min_val)\n    candidate_other = (max_val - min_val)\n    \n    ans = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_other)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting and Initial Setup**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements. The initial minimum and maximum values are set to the first and last elements of the sorted array, respectively.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: The code counts how many times the minimum and maximum values appear in the array. This helps determine if their removal will change the minimum or maximum of the resulting array.\n4. **Calculating Candidates**: Three scenarios are considered:\n   - **Removing the Minimum**: If the minimum occurs once, the new minimum is the next smallest element; otherwise, it remains the same.\n   - **Removing the Maximum**: If the maximum occurs once, the new maximum is the next largest element; otherwise, it remains the same.\n   - **Removing Any Other Element**: The instability remains the same as the original array.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three scenarios is printed as the result, representing the smallest possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the relevant scenarios, leveraging sorting and linear scans to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity.",
