His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour points (a) and the second tour points (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x\", and we don't know which one is Vasya's.\n\n However, note that the input does not specify which participant is Vasya. The catch: the two tours' results are given without names. So we have to consider that Vasya could be any participant? Actually, no: the problem states that Vasya was present, so there must be an assignment of the two arrays to participants such that one participant (Vasya) has a score from the first array and another from the second array (but wait, actually: the two numbers for Vasya are one from the first array and one from the second array? Or are they fixed? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   The teacher has the results of the first and second tour. Each participant has a score in the first tour and a score in the second tour.\n\n The input gives two lists: \n   First list: a1, a2, ..., an (first tour)\n   Second list: b1, b2, ..., bn (second tour)\n\n And we know that Vasya has two scores: one from the first list (say a_i) and one from the second list (say b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n But note: the same participant might appear multiple times? Actually, the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". And the input has n participants, so we have n pairs (a_i, b_i) but wait: the two lists are of size n, but they are given arbitrarily. \n\n Actually, the problem does not pair the first list with the second by index. We are free to assign any element of the first list to any element of the second list? \n\n However, note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and the participants are distinct. But the input does not tell us which participant corresponds to which. So we can reassign the second list arbitrarily to the first list?\n\n But wait: the condition is that Vasya has at least x points. The problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\". So we know that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) (with i and j independent) that sums to at least x.\n\n However, note: the same participant is represented by one element from the first and one from the second. But the problem does not require that the same index i is used for the same participant. \n\n But wait: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\". So each participant has one score in the first and one in the second. Therefore, the two lists together represent n participants, each with two scores. However, the assignment is arbitrary: we don't know which score from the first list goes with which from the second.\n\n So we have two sets of numbers. We are allowed to form n pairs (one from the first list and one from the second) arbitrarily (without repeating a participant). Then, for each participant, we have a total score = (score from first) + (score from second). Then the ranking is by total score (descending) and ties are broken arbitrarily.\n\n Now, we are told that Vasya is one of these participants, and we know that his total score is at least x. But note: the problem does not tell us which two numbers are Vasya's. However, the condition is that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x and that pair is Vasya's? Actually, no: the problem says \"Vasya got at least x points for both tours\", meaning his own two scores (from first and second) sum to at least x.\n\n But note: the input does not specify which two numbers belong to Vasya. However, we are allowed to choose which two numbers are Vasya's as long as they are from the two lists and we form the n pairs arbitrarily. \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"the teacher has the results\" and \"the participants' points are given in arbitrary order\". So we can assign the second list arbitrarily to the first. But note: the problem also says \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\" meaning that each of the n participants has one first-score and one second-score.\n\n But the catch: we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible rankings Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given scores from both tours and efficiently calculating the possible rankings without explicitly pairing all participants.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Each participant's total score is the sum of their first and second tour scores.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x` points.\n   - The ranking is determined by sorting all participants' total scores in descending order. In case of ties, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - To find the best possible rank (highest position), we need to maximize Vasya's total score relative to others. This involves pairing Vasya's highest possible score with the highest available score from the other tour.\n   - For the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score relative to others by pairing his lowest possible score with the lowest available score from the other tour.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists of scores (from the two tours) are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to count how many participants can have a higher total score than Vasya in the best case scenario (to determine the minimum rank) and similarly for the worst case (to determine the maximum rank).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The two-pointer traversal is O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    total_vasya_min = float('inf')\n    total_vasya_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    left = 0\n    right = n - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if a_list[mid] + b_list[n-1-mid] >= x:\n            total_vasya_max = max(total_vasya_max, a_list[mid] + b_list[n-1-mid])\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            \n    if total_vasya_max == float('-inf'):\n        best_rank = n\n    else:\n        best_rank = 1\n        s = total_vasya_max\n        j = 0\n        count_higher = 0\n        while j < n and b_list[j] >= s - a_list[j]:\n            if a_list[j] + b_list[j] > s:\n                count_higher += 1\n            j += 1\n            \n        for i in range(n):\n            if a_list[i] + b_list[i] > s:\n                count_higher += 1\n                \n        for i in range(n):\n            if a_list[i] + b_list[i] == s:\n                break\n            if a_list[i] + b_list[i] > s:\n                continue\n            else:\n                count_higher += 1\n                \n        best_rank = count_higher + 1\n        \n    left = 0\n    right = n - 1\n    total_vasya_min = float('inf')\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if a_list[mid] + b_list[mid] >= x:\n            total_vasya_min = min(total_vasya_min, a_list[mid] + b_list[mid])\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            \n    if total_vasya_min == float('inf'):\n        worst_rank = n\n    else:\n        worst_rank = 1\n        s = total_vasya_min\n        j = 0\n        count_higher = 0\n        while j < n:\n            if a_list[j] + b_list[j] > s:\n                count_higher += 1\n            j += 1\n            \n        for i in range(n):\n            if a_list[i] + b_list[i] == s:\n                break\n            if a_list[i] + b_list[i] > s:\n                continue\n            else:\n                count_higher += 1\n                \n        worst_rank = count_higher + 1\n        \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n` and the minimum required score `x`, followed by the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n3. **Finding Maximum Total Score**: Using binary search, we find the highest possible total score for Vasya that meets or exceeds `x`. This helps in determining the best possible rank by counting how many participants could have a higher score.\n4. **Finding Minimum Total Score**: Similarly, binary search is used to find the lowest possible total score for Vasya that meets or exceeds `x`, which helps in determining the worst possible rank.\n5. **Rank Calculation**: For each scenario (best and worst), the rank is calculated by counting the number of participants with higher scores and adjusting for ties.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible rankings by leveraging sorting and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
