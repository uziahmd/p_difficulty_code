Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards (each with an integer between -x and x) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then, we need to add a set of cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of the added cards is -S.\n\n We wish to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n We can use as many cards as we want, but each card's absolute value is at most x.\n\n The key is: what is the minimum number of cards needed to represent the value -S?\n\n Note: We are allowed to choose any integers from -x to x.\n\n Actually, we can break it down:\n\n Let T = -S (the target sum for the additional cards)\n\n We want to represent T as a sum of k integers, each in the range [-x, x]. What is the minimum k?\n\n Since we can choose positive and negative numbers, note:\n\n - If T = 0, then we need 0 additional cards.\n\n But note: we might already have a sum S that is non-zero, so T = -S.\n\n However, we are allowed to use multiple cards. The problem reduces to: \n\n What is the minimum number of cards (each with absolute value at most x) required to form the sum T?\n\n This is equivalent to: \n   We want the smallest k such that there exist integers a1, a2, ..., ak with |ai|<=x and sum_i ai = T.\n\n Conditions for k:\n\n 1. The maximum positive contribution from k cards is k*x (if all are x).\n 2. The maximum negative contribution is -k*x.\n\n So, we must have: T is in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n However, note that we can also use zeros, but zeros don't help. So we are effectively looking for the smallest k for which:\n\n   |T| <= k*x   [because if |T| is greater than k*x, then even if we use all positive or all negative, we cannot reach T]\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n Example: T=5, x=2, k=3 -> 3*2=6 >=5 -> so k=3 is sufficient? But let's check: \n   We can do 2+2+1? But wait, 1 is allowed (since |1|<=2). So yes.\n\n However, consider T=5, x=2, k=2 -> 2*2=4 <5 -> not sufficient.\n\n But note: we are allowed negative numbers too. Actually, we can also use negative numbers to adjust? \n\n Actually, the condition |T| <= k*x is necessary and sufficient because:\n\n   We can achieve T by using a combination of positive and negative. The necessary condition is that the absolute value of T must be at most k*x.\n\n Why? Because the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x (by using k copies of the sign that matches the sign of T). \n\n However, note: we can also mix. But the condition is that the total must be T. \n\n But wait: what if T is very large? Actually, we are only concerned with the minimal k.\n\n However, there is a catch: we can use both positive and negative numbers. But note that we can also use zeros. \n\n Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n Why? Because we can use at most k*x in absolute value. And we can always adjust the sum to be T if k*x >= |T|?\n\n Actually, no: consider T=1, x=1, then k=1 is enough. But if T=1, x=2, then k=1 is still enough.\n\n But wait: is it always possible to form T if k*x >= |T|?\n\n Yes, because we can use one card with value T (if |T|<=x, then k=ceil(|T|/x) would be 1 if |T|<=x) but actually we can use multiple cards.\n\n However, note: we can use any combination. The problem is similar to: given a set of available denominations from -x to x (excluding 0? actually including 0), but note that we can use zeros arbitrarily. However, zeros don't help so we ignore them.\n\n Actually, we can use the following greedy: \n\n We can use some positive and some negative. But note that we can also use zeros, but zeros don't change the sum.\n\n The minimal k must be at least ceil(|T| / x). Why? Because even if we use all positive (or all negative) we need at least that many. But wait, we can use both signs. \n\n Actually, consider: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x].

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining how many more cards are required to balance this sum to zero, considering each additional card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards. This sum is denoted as `S`.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is `-S` because we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Find Minimum Number of Cards**: The key insight is that the minimum number of cards needed to achieve the target sum `-S` is determined by the absolute value of `S` divided by `x`. Specifically, if the absolute value of `S` is less than or equal to `x`, one card is sufficient (as long as `-S` lies within the range `[-x, x]`). Otherwise, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of `S` divided by `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    target = -total_sum\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        k = abs_target // x\n        if abs_target % x != 0:\n            k += 1\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. This sum (`total_sum`) is used to determine the target sum (`target`) needed from additional cards to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Handling Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the answer is `0`.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target, the absolute value of the target is divided by `x`. If there is a remainder after division, an additional card is needed. The result is the ceiling of the division, which gives the minimum number of cards required to reach the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the solution by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with minimal computational overhead.",
