Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street is from 0 to l.\n\n We note that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n\n There are two main parts:\n   a) The gap at the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern's position.\n      The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least its own position. So we need d such that 0 + d >= first_lantern.\n      Therefore, d must be at least the distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n   b) Similarly, the gap at the end: from the last lantern to l. The last lantern must cover up to l, so d must be at least (l - last_lantern).\n\n   c) In the middle, we have gaps between consecutive lanterns. For two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]:\n        The gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]).\n        To cover the gap, the two lanterns must overlap or meet. The condition is that the right lantern should start no later than the left lantern's coverage ends.\n        Specifically, the left lantern covers up to a[i] + d, and the right lantern starts at a[i+1] - d. We require that a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d, i.e., 2*d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]).\n\n However, note: the entire street is covered if for every segment between two consecutive lanterns (or the edges) the condition holds.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the minimum light radius d.\n\n Approach:\n   We can consider:\n     candidate1 = the maximum of the following values (each being a necessary d for some part):\n        - The distance from 0 to the first lantern: d0 = first_lantern (because the first lantern must reach from 0 to first_lantern)\n        - The distance from the last lantern to l: d_last = l - last_lantern\n        - For each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]): the gap is g = a[i+1] - a[i]. The required d for this gap is (g)/2 (because two lanterns each covering half the gap? Actually, the condition is that the left lantern's rightmost coverage (a[i] + d) must meet the right lantern's leftmost coverage (a[i+1] - d). So we require a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d  => 2*d >= g  => d >= g/2.\n\n   Therefore, the minimum d that satisfies all conditions is the maximum of:\n        d1 = a[0]   (if we set d = a[0], then the first lantern will cover [0 - a[0] is negative, but we only care from 0 to a[0]+d. Since d must be at least a[0] to cover from 0 to a[0])\n        d2 = l - a[-1]\n        d3 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for i in range(n-1) )\n\n   But wait: what if we have multiple lanterns? Actually, the entire street is covered by the union of the lanterns. We must cover:\n\n     From 0 to the first lantern: requires d >= a[0]\n     Between two consecutive lanterns: requires d >= (gap)/2\n     From the last lantern to l: requires d >= l - a[-1]\n\n   However, note that the condition for the consecutive lanterns might not require the entire gap to be covered by one lantern, but by two. The minimal d that covers the entire street is the maximum of:\n\n        d_left = a[0]   (if the first lantern is at a[0], then without any other lantern, d must be at least a[0] to cover 0)\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        d_between = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for i in range(n-1) )\n\n   Then answer = max(d_left, d_right, d_between)\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        n=2, l=5, lanterns = [2,5]\n        d_left = 2 (since 0 to 2: d must be at least 2)\n        d_right = 5-5 = 0\n        d_between = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        Then answer = max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> matches sample.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        First, sort the list: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        d_left = 0 -> 0 (but actually, the first lantern is at 0, so we need to cover from 0 to 0? That's 0. But wait, the street goes from 0 to 15. \n        Actually, the first lantern is at 0, so it will cover [-d, d] but since the street starts at 0, we only need to cover from 0 to 0? Not exactly.\n\n        Let me break down:\n\n        The street from 0 to 15.\n\n        The first lantern is at 0: so it covers [0-d, 0+d]. Since d must be nonnegative, we require that 0-d <= 0 and 0+d >= 0. \n        The critical part is the right side: we require 0+d >= 0 (which is always true) and also we require that the left side (negative) is not an issue because the street starts at 0.\n\n        However, the problem is that the entire street must be lit. The first lantern at 0 covers from 0 to d. So to cover the beginning (from 0 to 0) we don't need much, but we must cover the entire street.\n\n        Now, let's compute:\n\n        d_left = 0 (because the first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 to 0 is 0)\n        d_right = 15 - 15 = 0\n        Now, the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n          0 to 3: gap=3 -> d_needed = 3/2 = 1.5\n          3 to 5: gap=2 -> d_needed = 1.0\n          5 to 7: gap=2 -> d_needed = 1.0\n          7 to 9: gap=2 -> d_needed = 1.0\n          9 to 14: gap=5 -> d_needed = 2.5\n          14 to 15: gap=1 -> d_needed = 0.5\n\n        Then d_between = 2.5\n\n        Then answer = max(0,0,2.5) = 2.5 -> matches sample.\n\n   But wait, why does the first lantern at 0 allow d_left=0? Because the first lantern is at 0, so even with d=0, the point 0 is covered. However, we must also cover the rest.\n\n   However, note: the entire street is [0,15]. The first lantern at 0 with d=2.5 will cover [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5]. The street from 0 to 2.5 is covered. Then the next lantern at 3 must cover from 3-2.5=0.5 to 3+2.5=5.5. But wait, the gap from 0 to 3: the first lantern already covers up to 2.5, so the next lantern must cover from 2.5 to 3. With d=2.5, the next lantern (at 3) covers from 0.5 to 5.5, which includes 2.5 to 3. Then the next lantern at 5: from 5-2.5=2.5 to 5+2.5=7.5, etc.\n\n   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n   However, note: if there are multiple lanterns, the condition for the left edge is not necessarily the first lantern's position, but the gap from 0 to the first lantern must be covered by the first lantern. Similarly, the gap from the last lantern to l must be covered by the last lantern.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a lantern not at 0? Then the first lantern might be at position x. Then the left edge is from 0 to x. The first lantern must cover 0, so d must be at least x (to cover from x-d to x+d, and we require x-d <= 0 and x+d >= 0, but the street starts at 0, so we require x+d >= 0 (which is always true if x>=0) and the critical condition is that the left side of the first lantern (x-d) must be <=0. Actually, we require that the first lantern's coverage extends to 0. So d must be at least (x - 0) = x? \n\n   However, note: the coverage of the first lantern is [x-d, x+d]. We require that 0 is in [x-d, x+d]. Since x>=0, the left part is x-d<=0 => d>=x. So yes, d must be at least x.\n\n   Similarly, for the last lantern at y, we require that l is in [y-d, y+d]. Since y<=l, we require y+d>=l => d>=l-y.\n\n   And for two consecutive lanterns at x and y (with x<y): we require that the entire interval [x, y] is covered by the two lanterns. The first lantern covers up to x+d, and the second lantern covers from y-d. The condition is that x+d >= y-d, i.e., d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n        d0 = (first_lantern)   [i.e., a[0]]\n        d1 = (l - last_lantern) [i.e., l - a[-1]]\n        d2 = max_{i} ( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 ) [for all consecutive pairs]\n\n   However, note: the entire street must be covered. But what if the lanterns are not contiguous? The above conditions ensure that the entire street is covered.\n\n   But wait: what if there's a gap that is covered by more than two lanterns? The condition for consecutive lanterns is sufficient because we are looking at the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns and the edges.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read n and l.\n     2. Read the list of n integers.\n     3. Sort the list.\n     4. Compute:\n          candidate1 = a[0]   # for the left edge\n          candidate2 = l - a[-1]   # for the right edge\n          candidate3 = 0.0\n          for i in range(len(a)-1):\n              gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n              candidate3 = max(candidate3, gap / 2.0)\n\n     5. Answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n   However, what if n=0? Then there are no lanterns. Then we must have d at least l/2? But the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        candidate1 = 2\n        candidate2 = 5-5 = 0\n        candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        Answer = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        After sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        candidate1 = 0\n        candidate2 = 15-15=0\n        candidate3 = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) \n                   = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n        Answer = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n   But wait: consider a case with a single lantern.\n\n   Example: \"1 10\\n5\" \n        n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n        candidate1 = 5\n        candidate2 = 10-5=5\n        candidate3 = 0 (since no consecutive pairs)\n        Answer = max(5,5,0)=5.0\n\n        Is that correct? \n            The street is from 0 to 10. The lantern at 5 with d=5 covers [0,10]. Yes.\n\n   Another example: \"1 10\\n0\"\n        candidate1 = 0\n        candidate2 = 10-0=10\n        candidate3 = 0\n        Answer = 10.0 -> correct, because the lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to 10, so d=10.\n\n   One more: \"1 10\\n10\"\n        candidate1 = 10 (the first and only lantern at 10)\n        candidate2 = 10-10=0\n        candidate3 = 0\n        Answer = 10.0 -> correct, because the lantern at 10 must cover from 0 to 10, so d=10.\n\n   However, wait: if we have a single lantern at 10, then the coverage is [10-d, 10+d]. To cover 0, we require 10-d <= 0 => d>=10. So yes.\n\n   But note: the street is from 0 to 10. The lantern at 10 must cover 0, so d>=10. Also, the street ends at 10, which is covered by the lantern (since 10+d>=10 is always true if d>=10). So the minimal d is 10.\n\n   However, what if we have two lanterns at the same location?\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 5\"\n        sorted: [5,5]\n        candidate1 = 5\n        candidate2 = 10-5=5\n        candidate3 = (5-5)/2 = 0\n        Answer = 5.0\n\n        Check: with d=5, the lanterns at 5 cover [0,10] (from 5-5=0 to 5+5=10). So correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: We must use floating point because the answer can be a float.\n\n   However, note the problem says: \"The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\"\n\n   We'll output the number with 10 decimal places.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   # If there is only one lantern, then we don't have consecutive pairs, but we still have the two edges.\n\n   cand1 = a[0]  # distance from left edge to the first lantern\n   cand2 = l - a[-1]  # distance from the last lantern to the right edge\n   cand3 = 0.0\n\n   if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2, because two lanterns each covering half the gap (if d is at least gap/2, then the left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, and the right lantern starts at a[i+1]-d, and we require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d -> d>=gap/2)\n            if gap / 2.0 > cand3:\n                cand3 = gap / 2.0\n\n   ans = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\n   # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   However, wait: is it possible that the maximum value is negative? No, because n>=1, and the positions are between 0 and l. So cand1 and cand2 are nonnegative, and cand3 is nonnegative.\n\n   But note: what if the street is empty? The problem says n>=1 and l>=1.\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   However, let me test with a sample from the problem statement.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the ends. Our method handles that.\n\n   Let me run the sample: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n   cand1 = 2, cand2=0, cand3= (5-2)/2=1.5 -> max is 2.\n\n   But wait: the sample output is 2.0000000000.\n\n   So we output 2.0000000000.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the street is of length l, and the lanterns are at points ai (0<=ai<=l). \n\n   One more corner: if the street has length 0? The problem says l>=1, so no.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9). \n\n   The list of ai can have duplicates, but sorting and then processing gaps is safe.\n\n   Let me test with duplicate lanterns:\n\n   Example: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n        cand1 = 0\n        cand2 = 0\n        cand3 = max((5-0)/2, (10-5)/2) = max(2.5, 2.5) = 2.5 -> answer 2.5\n\n        Check: with d=2.5, the first lantern at 0: [0-2.5,0+2.5] = [-2.5,2.5] -> covers [0,2.5]\n                second at 5: [2.5,7.5]\n                third at 10: [7.5,12.5] -> covers [7.5,10] (since the street ends at 10).\n\n        So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But wait, the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, and we require d>=2.5. Similarly, the gap between 5 and 10 is 5, so d>=2.5. The edges are 0 and 0. So the minimal d is 2.5.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n   However, wait: what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street even after using the maximum d? \n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n3 7\"\n        cand1 = 3\n        cand2 = 3 (because 10-7=3)\n        cand3 = (7-3)/2 = 2.0\n        Then d = max(3,3,2) = 3.0.\n\n        Check: \n            Lantern at 3 with d=3: covers [0,6] (from 0 to 3+3=6)\n            Lantern at 7 with d=3: covers [4,10] (from 7-3=4 to 10)\n            The gap from 6 to 4? Actually, the first lantern covers up to 6, the second starts at 4. So the coverage is [0,6] and [4,10] -> together [0,10]. \n\n        But wait, what about the point 5.5? It is in the second lantern's coverage? Yes, because 5.5 is between 4 and 10.\n\n        However, note the condition for the gap: the two lanterns must meet. The condition we used was d >= (7-3)/2 = 2.0. But we set d=3 which is >=2.0. \n\n        The condition for the gap is satisfied, and the edges are satisfied.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Let me try another: \"2 10\\n1 9\"\n        cand1 = 1\n        cand2 = 1 (10-9=1)\n        cand3 = (9-1)/2 = 4.0\n        Then d = 4.0.\n\n        Check: \n            First lantern at 1: covers [1-4,1+4] = [-3,5] -> so covers [0,5]\n            Second lantern at 9: covers [9-4,9+4] = [5,13] -> covers [5,10] (since the street ends at 10)\n\n        So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   Another: \"2 10\\n2 8\"\n        cand1=2, cand2=2, cand3=(8-2)/2=3 -> d=3\n        First lantern: [2-3,2+3] = [-1,5] -> covers [0,5]\n        Second lantern: [8-3,8+3] = [5,11] -> covers [5,10] (since the street ends at 10). So the entire street is covered.\n\n   But wait, what if the gap is odd? \n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n2 7\"\n        cand1=2, cand2=3, cand3=(7-2)/2=2.5 -> d=3.0\n        First lantern: [2-3,2+3] = [-1,5] -> covers [0,5]\n        Second lantern: [7-3,7+3] = [4,10] -> covers [4,10]\n\n        The gap from 5 to 4 is negative? Actually, the first lantern covers up to 5, and the second starts at 4, so the entire street is covered.\n\n   But note: the condition for the gap is that the two lanterns must meet. The meeting point is when the first lantern's right end (a[i]+d) is at least the second lantern's left end (a[i+1]-d). So 5>=4 -> yes.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: we are taking the maximum of three values. But sometimes the maximum might be from the edges and sometimes from the gaps.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if we have more than two lanterns and the maximum gap is in the middle? Then the middle gap condition will set the d, but the edges might require a larger d? \n\n   Example: \"3 10\\n0 1 9\"\n        cand1 = 0\n        cand2 = 10-9=1\n        cand3 = max( (1-0)/2, (9-1)/2 ) = max(0.5, 4.0) = 4.0\n        Then d=4.0.\n\n        Check: \n            First lantern at 0: [-4,4] -> covers [0,4] (since the street starts at 0)\n            Second lantern at 1: [-3,5] -> covers [0,5] (overlapping with the first)\n            Third lantern at 9: [5,13] -> covers [5,10]\n\n        So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`. Each lantern at position `a_i` covers the interval `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. The entire street must be covered by the union of these intervals. The solution involves ensuring that:\n   - The leftmost part of the street (from `0` to the first lantern) is covered by the first lantern.\n   - The rightmost part of the street (from the last lantern to `l`) is covered by the last lantern.\n   - The gaps between consecutive lanterns are covered by the combined coverage of adjacent lanterns.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must extend from `0` to its position, so `d` must be at least the distance from `0` to the first lantern.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: The last lantern must extend from its position to `l`, so `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined coverage. The minimal `d` for each gap is half the distance between them. The largest such value across all gaps will determine the minimal `d` needed for the middle sections.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Sort the lantern positions to easily compute the distances to the edges and between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculate three candidate values for `d`:\n     - The distance from `0` to the first lantern.\n     - The distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n     - The maximum of half the distances between all pairs of consecutive lanterns.\n   - The solution is the maximum of these three candidates, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting the list of lantern positions takes `O(n log n)` time.\n   - Iterating through the sorted list to compute the maximum gap requires `O(n)` time.\n   - The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it efficient for the given constraints (`n ≤ 1000`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    cand1 = a[0]\n    cand2 = l - a[-1]\n    cand3 = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            required = gap / 2.0\n            if required > cand3:\n                cand3 = required\n                \n    ans = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate calculating the distances to the edges and between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Calculations**: \n   - `cand1` is the distance from `0` to the first lantern, ensuring the left edge is covered.\n   - `cand2` is the distance from the last lantern to `l`, ensuring the right edge is covered.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is divided by 2 to find the minimal `d` required to cover that gap. The largest such value across all gaps is stored in `cand3`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The solution is the maximum value among `cand1`, `cand2`, and `cand3`, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.",
