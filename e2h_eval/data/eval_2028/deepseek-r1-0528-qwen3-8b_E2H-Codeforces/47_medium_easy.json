    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (with 1 <= a,b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b (if a < b then d is negative, but we can assume without loss of generality that we set x = a+k and y = b+k, then note that x-y = a-b is fixed).\n\nWe have: \n  Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, |a-b|)   [since gcd(x,y)=gcd(x,y-x)]\n\nThen, LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / g.\n\nNote: Without loss of generality, we can assume that we are looking for k such that a+k and b+k are positive (which they are for k>=0).\n\nObservation:\n  The difference between (a+k) and (b+k) is fixed: d = a-b (which is constant). So we can write:\n      x = a+k, y = b+k, then x - y = a-b.\n\nBut note: if a==b, then we have x=y, so the LCM is just x (or y). Then we want to minimize x, so k=0.\n\nIf a != b, let d = abs(a-b). Then note that the gcd of x and y must divide d. Therefore, the divisors of the LCM are limited by the divisors of d.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the condition on k is that the gcd(x,y) must divide d. And note that as k increases, the numbers x and y increase, but their gcd might change.\n\nHowever, note that we can also think in terms of factors of d. Since the gcd must divide d, then the possible values for the gcd are the divisors of d.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the smallest k (non-negative) that minimizes the LCM. \n\nAnother approach:\n\nLet d = |a-b|. Without loss of generality, assume d>0.\n\nWe can consider that for a fixed divisor g of d, we can set the gcd to be g. Then we require that g divides both a+k and b+k. Since g divides d, then we have:\n\n  a+k ≡ 0 (mod g)  => k ≡ (-a) mod g\n  Similarly, k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\nBut note: since d = a-b, then if g divides d, then (-a) mod g is the same as (-b) mod g? Actually, because g divides d, then a ≡ b (mod g). So the condition is the same for both: k ≡ (-a) mod g, and k ≡ (-b) mod g, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor g of d, we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that:\n    k ≡ (-a) mod g   (i.e., k ≡ (g - (a mod g)) % g, but careful: if a mod g is 0 then k should be 0? Actually, we require k ≡ (-a) mod g, so k = (g - (a % g)) % g, but note: if a % g == 0 then k=0.\n\nBut wait: k must satisfy both conditions, and they are the same. However, note that the modulus condition is over the same g.\n\nBut there's more: the gcd might not necessarily be exactly g, it could be a multiple of g? Actually, no: we are fixing the gcd to be at least g, but the actual gcd might be larger. However, note that the condition for having the gcd divisible by g is that g divides d and k satisfies the congruence. But the actual gcd might be any divisor of d that is >= g? Actually, the gcd must divide d and we are considering all divisors.\n\nBut here's the catch: the LCM is (x*y)/g. However, if the actual gcd is g', then we have LCM = (x*y)/g'. So to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the gcd (because the product x*y is increasing with k, but the divisor g' is increasing too). However, note that the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k, so we cannot simply maximize g' arbitrarily.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nWe know that the gcd(x,y) must divide d. Therefore, the gcd is one of the divisors of d. So we can iterate over all divisors g of d and consider the minimal k that makes g divide both (a+k) and (b+k). Then, for that k, the gcd will be at least g (actually, it will be the gcd which is a divisor of d, but we are forcing one condition).\n\nBut note: the minimal k for divisor g is k0(g) = (g - (a % g)) % g. However, we must note that if a % g == 0, then k0(g)=0, otherwise k0(g) = g - (a % g). But wait: we require that (a+k) % g == 0 and (b+k)%g==0. Since (a+k) % g = (a % g + k % g) % g, and similarly for b, but note that k must be chosen so that k ≡ -a (mod g). The smallest non-negative k is indeed k0(g) = (g - (a % g)) % g, but if a % g == 0 then k0(g)=0, else k0(g)=g - (a % g).\n\nHowever, note: we must also ensure that the gcd of (a+k0(g)) and (b+k0(g)) is exactly a divisor of d, but it might not be g. It could be a multiple of g? Actually, no: because the gcd must divide d, and we are only requiring that g divides both. But the actual gcd could be any divisor of d that is a multiple of g? Not necessarily. For example, if d=12 and g=4, then k0(4) might lead to gcd being 4, or 12? Actually, the gcd must divide d, so it must be a divisor of 12, and if 4 divides the gcd then the gcd must be 4, 8, or 12? But 8 does not divide 12. So the gcd must be a divisor of d and divisible by g. However, we don't know the exact gcd, but note that the LCM formula uses the gcd.\n\nBut here's the problem: we are trying to minimize the LCM. The LCM is (x * y) / gcd(x,y). We are going to consider candidate k's from the divisors of d.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. If a == b, then answer is 0.\n\n2. Let d = abs(a-b). Then, factorize d to get all divisors? But note: d can be up to 10^9, so we need an efficient way to factorize.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d (including 1 and d), compute candidate k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g. However, note: we require that g divides d, but also note that we must have k0 such that (a+k0) and (b+k0) are divisible by g. This k0 is the smallest non-negative solution.\n\n4. Then, for this k0, we can compute the gcd of (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the LCM would be (a+k0)*(b+k0) // gcd_value.\n\nBut wait: why do we need to compute the gcd again? Because the gcd might not be g, but a divisor of d that is a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd must divide d, but it might be any divisor. However, note that we are forcing that g divides the gcd, so the gcd is a multiple of g and divides d. But the actual gcd might be larger than g (if it has more common factors). But then, how does that affect the LCM?\n\nActually, the LCM depends on the actual gcd. But note: we are iterating over divisors g of d. However, the same k might be produced by multiple divisors? And also, we are only considering k0 for divisors g, but the same k might appear from different divisors.\n\nBut note: the condition for k0(g) is that k0(g) is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k). Then, the gcd of (a+k0(g)) and (b+k0(g)) is at least g, but might be greater. However, we are interested in the minimal LCM, and the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd. So if we fix k, then the gcd might be larger than g, and that would make the LCM smaller.\n\nBut wait: the product (a+k)*(b+k) is fixed for a fixed k, and the larger the gcd, the smaller the LCM. So for a fixed k, if we can get a larger gcd, the LCM is smaller. However, we are generating k from divisors of d, and the condition for k0(g) is that g divides the numbers, so the gcd is at least g. But the actual gcd might be higher.\n\nBut note: the gcd must divide d, so we are already covering all divisors. However, we are missing something: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. Also, what if the gcd is not one of the divisors we considered? Actually, the gcd must be a divisor of d, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut there is a catch: the k we are generating are the minimal k for each divisor g. However, note that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. For example, if k0(g1)=k0(g2)=k, then we don't want to compute the LCM twice.\n\nMoreover, we must consider that k=0 might be the best even if d has divisors, but note: if a==b, then k=0 is the answer.\n\nBut also note: we must consider k beyond those generated by divisors? Actually, the problem requires the minimal LCM and then the smallest k. However, the key observation is that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide d. Therefore, the value of k must be such that for some divisor g of d, we have k ≡ (-a) mod g. So the candidate k's are exactly the ones we are generating (the minimal k for each divisor g) and then possibly more? Actually, the set of k's that make the gcd divisible by g is periodic with period g. But we are only taking the minimal k for each divisor. However, we must also consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are allowed to consider k=0,1,..., maybe even negative? No, k>=0.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"if there are multiple optimal integers k, choose the smallest one\". So we are to compare candidate k's (from divisors) and then choose the one that gives minimal LCM, and if tie the smallest k.\n\nHowever, is it sufficient to consider only the minimal k for each divisor? Consider: the condition for having the gcd divisible by g is that k ≡ (-a) mod g. The next k that satisfies that is k0(g) + t*g for t>=0. But note: as k increases, the numbers (a+k) and (b+k) become larger, so the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing, and the gcd might also change (but the gcd must divide d). However, the LCM might not be minimal at the first occurrence (k0(g)) because a larger k might have a larger gcd (thus making the LCM smaller) even though the product is larger? Let me check:\n\nSuppose we have two candidates: k1 and k2 (k1 < k2). At k1, the gcd is g1, at k2, the gcd is g2 (and g2 > g1). Then the LCM at k1 is (a+k1)*(b+k1)/g1, and at k2 is (a+k2)*(b+k2)/g2.\n\nEven if g2 is larger, the product (a+k2)*(b+k2) is much larger. So it's not clear.\n\nBut note: the LCM is the product divided by the gcd. However, the product is increasing with k, so we cannot rely solely on the gcd to reduce the LCM arbitrarily.\n\nAlternative Insight (known from problems):\n\nActually, there is a known problem similar to this: \"Neko does Maths\" from a past competition. The solution is to consider the divisors of |a-b| (if a!=b) and then the candidate k's are the divisors themselves and also the divisors minus the remainder? \n\nBut note: the example: \n  Input: 6 10 -> Output: 2\n\nHere, d = 4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - (6%1)) % 1 -> but 6%1 is 0, so k0=0.\n  Then, LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nFor g=2: k0 = (2 - (6%2)) % 2 = (2-0)%2 = 0.\n  Then, LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nFor g=4: k0 = (4 - (6%4)) % 4 = (4-2)%4=2.\n  Then, numbers: 6+2=8, 10+2=12. GCD(8,12)=4, LCM= (8*12)//4=24.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, and the smallest k that achieves it is 2.\n\nBut wait, why didn't we consider k=1?\nAt k=1: numbers 7 and 11, GCD=1, LCM=77 -> worse.\nk=2: 8 and 12, GCD=4, LCM=24.\nk=3: 9 and 13, GCD=1, LCM=117.\n\nSo k=2 is the answer.\n\nBut note: the candidate k's we considered were 0 and 2. Why didn't we consider k=1? Because k=1 doesn't correspond to any divisor of d=4? Actually, the condition for k=1: the gcd must divide 4, and indeed it does (1 divides 4). But our method only considers k0(g) for divisors g, and k0(1)=0, k0(2)=0, k0(4)=2. So we did not generate k=1.\n\nBut wait, the condition for the gcd being 1 is satisfied by k=0 and k=1 and k=2, etc. However, we are generating the minimal k for each divisor. But note: the minimal k for divisor 1 is 0, and then the next k that satisfies the condition for divisor 1 is 1, then 2, etc. However, we are not iterating over all k, only the minimal k for each divisor.\n\nBut the problem is: we are only testing the minimal k for each divisor. But is it possible that a non-minimal k for a divisor gives a better LCM? \n\nConsider: For divisor g, the next k is k0(g)+g, then k0(g)+2g, etc.\n\nBut note: the LCM at k0(g) is (a+k0(g))*(b+k0(g))/gcd_value, and at k0(g)+g is (a+k0(g)+g)*(b+k0(g)+g)/gcd_value_at_k0(g)+g.\n\nThe product is larger, but the gcd might be larger too (if the increased numbers share more divisors). However, the LCM might be smaller? \n\nBut note: the LCM is (x*y)/gcd. The gcd can only increase (if the numbers share more common factors) but the product is increasing too. \n\nBut observe: the minimal LCM might occur at a k that is not the minimal one for any divisor? \n\nWait: the condition for the gcd is that it divides d. Therefore, the gcd is a divisor of d. Now, the set of k for which the gcd is at least g is periodic with period g. So the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k that makes the gcd divisible by g. But the actual gcd at that k might be a divisor of d that is greater than g? \n\nBut note: the set of k that make the gcd divisible by g is the same as the set of k that are congruent to (-a) mod g. However, the actual gcd might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g. But since d is fixed, the divisors are fixed. \n\nBut the key point: the minimal k for each divisor g gives us a candidate. However, the problem is that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are missing k's that are not the minimal for any divisor? \n\nWait, actually: every k that makes the gcd divisible by some divisor g must be congruent to (-a) mod g for that divisor g. But we are iterating over all divisors g. However, note that if k is generated by divisor g, then k is one of the residues modulo g. But we are only taking the minimal residue (non-negative and smallest). \n\nBut note: the set of k that make the gcd divisible by g is an arithmetic progression. However, the minimal k is the smallest non-negative in that progression. \n\nBut is it possible that a candidate k (from a divisor g) is not the minimal k overall? Actually, we are generating one candidate per divisor. Then we must compare the LCM at these candidate k's and also consider that the same k might appear from multiple divisors.\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer is 2 for (6,10). We got k=2 from divisor 4. What about other divisors? \n\nBut wait, there's another candidate: the minimal k for divisor 1 is 0, divisor 2 is 0, divisor 4 is 2. So we consider k=0 and k=2. Then we compute the LCM at k=0 and k=2.\n\nNow, what about k=4? It is the next candidate for divisor 4: k0(4)+4 = 2+4=6. But we don't need to consider k=6 because k=2 already gave a lower LCM than k=0, and k=6 would be even larger.\n\nBut is it possible that a k that is not the minimal for any divisor gives a lower LCM? \n\nConsider: the condition for having a high gcd is that k must be chosen such that the gcd is as large as possible. However, the gcd is bounded by the divisors of d. \n\nBut note: the minimal k for divisor g is the smallest k that makes the gcd divisible by g. Then, the next k (adding g) might give a gcd that is a multiple of g (if the numbers share more factors) but the product is larger. \n\nBut the LCM is (product)/gcd. It is not obvious whether the next k (k0(g)+g) would have a smaller LCM.\n\nHowever, note: the minimal LCM might occur at k=0 (if a and b are such that they have a large gcd) or at a positive k. \n\nBut the insight from known problems (like CodeForces problem \"Neko does Maths\") is that we only need to consider the divisors of d (which is |a-b|) and the candidate k's are the divisors and the divisors minus the remainder, but also note that sometimes k=0 is included.\n\nBut wait, there is a known solution for this problem: \n  if a == b: print(0)\n  else:\n      d = abs(a-b)\n      ans_k = 0\n      ans_lcm = lcm(a, b)   # but note: when k=0, the LCM is lcm(a,b)\n\n      Then, for each divisor g of d:\n          k = (g - a % g) % g   # This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0.\n          # But note: we must also ensure that k is non-negative and minimal.\n\n          Then, compute the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k). Then the LCM = (a+k)*(b+k) // gcd_value.\n\n          Then, compare this LCM with the current minimal LCM, and if it is smaller then update the answer (k and LCM). If the same LCM, then choose the smallest k.\n\n      But wait, what if the gcd is not g? Then we are using the actual gcd. That is correct.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the divisor g might not be the actual gcd. But that's okay because we are computing the LCM using the actual gcd.\n\nBut note: the divisor g is a divisor of d, and we are generating k such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then the gcd is at least g, but we don't know if it is exactly g. However, the LCM calculation uses the actual gcd.\n\nBut the problem: we must consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. But we are iterating over divisors, and we are storing the candidate k and LCM.\n\nBut note: there is an alternative solution that considers that the minimal k must be one of the divisors of d (or divisor - remainder) but also including k=0.\n\nHowever, the above method (iterating over divisors) is acceptable because d can be up to 10^9, but the number of divisors is at most around 1344 (for highly composite numbers). So we can factorize d and then iterate over all divisors.\n\nBut wait: what if d=0? Then a==b, and we already handled a==b.\n\nBut note: the input says a,b>=1, so d=0 only when a=b.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n2. If a==b: print(0) and exit.\n3. Let d = abs(a-b).\n4. Factorize d to get all divisors. (We can do by iterating i from 1 to sqrt(d))\n5. Initialize:\n      best_k = 0\n      best_lcm = lcm(a, b)   # which is (a*b)//gcd(a,b) but note: k=0 is one candidate.\n\n6. For each divisor g in divisors (including 1 and d):\n      k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g   # This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0, and note that since d is divisible by g, then (b+k) % g will be (b % g + k % g) % g = (b % g + (-a % g)) % g. But since g divides d, then (a-b) % g == 0, so a % g = b % g. Therefore, k0 is valid for both.\n\n      Then, we compute:\n          x = a + k0\n          y = b + k0\n          g_val = gcd(x, y)   # This will be at least g, and divides d (because d is divisible by g, and the gcd divides d? Actually, the gcd divides any linear combination, and note that d = a-b, so gcd(x,y) divides (x-y)=d.\n\n      Then, current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n      Then, if current_lcm < best_lcm, then update best_lcm and best_k = k0.\n            if current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k, then update best_k = k0.\n\n7. Print best_k.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors? Then we are comparing the same k0 multiple times. That's okay because we are storing the minimal LCM for that k0 (and if we get the same LCM from the same k0, we don't update because we are updating only when we see a smaller LCM or same LCM with a smaller k). But note: we are storing the best_k (the candidate k) and best_lcm.\n\nBut note: the same k0 might appear from multiple divisors. Then, we are going to compute the same LCM multiple times. But that's acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must note: the divisor list includes duplicates? No, we are getting distinct divisors.\n\nBut wait: what if d is very large and we have many divisors? The number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (about 10^4.5 divisors, which is around 10^5 worst-case? Actually, the maximum number of divisors for numbers up to 10^9 is around 1344).\n\nBut note: we are computing the gcd for each candidate k0. The numbers a+k0 and b+k0 can be as large as 10^9 + 10^9 (if k0 is up to d, and d<=10^9). The gcd computation is logarithmic, so it's efficient.\n\nBut wait: is k0 always less than or equal to d? Yes, because k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g, and g is a divisor of d, so g<=d, and k0 is in [0, g-1] (if a%g !=0, then k0=g-(a%g); if a%g==0, then k0=0). So k0 is at most g-1, and g<=d, so k0<=d-1.\n\nBut note: d can be as large as 10^9, so k0 is at most 10^9, but we are iterating over divisors (about 1344 divisors) and for each divisor we do a gcd computation (which is O(log(max(x,y))) and then a multiplication (which is O(1)). So the total operations is about 1344 * (log(10^18)) which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: there is a catch. The above method does not consider k's that are not the minimal k for any divisor. \n\nBut note: the condition for the gcd being a divisor g is that k ≡ (-a) mod g. The minimal k for each divisor g is the smallest non-negative solution. However, the actual minimal k that minimizes the LCM might be a non-minimal solution for some divisor? \n\nLet me test with a simple example: a=5, b=10. Then d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - 5%1)%1 = 0. Then numbers:5,10 -> gcd=5, LCM=(5*10)//5=10.\nFor g=5: k0 = (5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0. Then numbers:5,10 -> same as above.\n\nBut wait, what if we take k=5? Then numbers:10,15 -> gcd=5, LCM= (10*15)//5=30. Worse.\n\nBut what about k=1? \n  Then numbers:6,11 -> gcd=1, LCM=66.\nk=2:7,12->gcd=1, LCM=84.\nk=3:8,13->gcd=1, LCM=104.\nk=4:9,14->gcd=1, LCM=126.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 10 at k=0.\n\nBut wait, the example input: \n  Input: ['5 10'] -> Output: '0'\n\nYes, so our method returns k=0.\n\nBut wait, the example provided in the problem was:\n  Input: ['6 10','21 31','5 10']\n\n  Output: ['2','9','0']\n\nSo for (5,10) we output 0.\n\nBut wait, the example (5,10) is the last one, and the expected output is 0.\n\nBut why did the example (6,10) work? \n\nAnother example: (21,31). d=10. Divisors:1,2,5,10.\n\nFor g=1: k0=0 -> numbers:21,31 -> gcd=1, LCM=21*31=651.\nFor g=2: k0 = (2-21%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> numbers:22,32 -> gcd=2, LCM= (22*32)//2=352.\nFor g=5: k0 = (5-21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5=4 -> numbers:25,35 -> gcd=5, LCM=(25*35)//5=175.\nFor g=10: k0=(10-21%10)%10=(10-1)%10=9 -> numbers:30,40 -> gcd=10, LCM=(30*40)//10=120.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 120 at k=9.\n\nBut wait, is there a k smaller than 9 that gives LCM<=120? \nk=0:651\nk=1:22,32 -> LCM=352\nk=2:23,33 -> gcd=1, LCM=759\nk=3:24,34 -> gcd=2, LCM=(24*34)//2=408\nk=4:25,35 -> gcd=5, LCM=175\nk=5:26,36 -> gcd=2, LCM=(26*36)//2=468\nk=6:27,37 -> gcd=1, LCM=999\nk=7:28,38 -> gcd=2, LCM=532\nk=8:29,39 -> gcd=1, LCM=1131\nk=9:30,40 -> LCM=120.\n\nSo indeed, k=9 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: our method found k=9 from divisor 10. \n\nBut note: the divisor 10 is the largest divisor, and k0=9. \n\nHowever, note that the divisor 5 also gave k0=4, and at k=4 we got LCM=175, which is worse than 120.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nBut wait: what if the minimal k is not the minimal k for the divisor that gives the highest gcd? In the example (21,31), the divisor 10 gives the highest gcd (10) and the minimal k for divisor 10 is 9. The divisor 5 gives a gcd of 5 and k=4, which is smaller k but worse LCM.\n\nSo we are not just maximizing the gcd, but minimizing the LCM.\n\nBut note: the LCM is (x*y)/gcd. The product x*y is minimized when k is small, but the gcd might be small too. Or when k is large, the product is large but the gcd might be large enough to compensate.\n\nTherefore, we must consider all divisors.\n\nBut note: there is a catch. The above method only considers the minimal k for each divisor. However, the same k might be achieved by multiple divisors. But that's okay because we are storing the candidate k and the LCM.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that a divisor g1 gives k0, and then a divisor g2 (larger than g1) gives a k0' which is larger than k0, but the LCM at k0' is smaller than at k0? Yes, as in the example (21,31): k0=0 (divisor1) gives LCM=651, k0=1 (divisor2) gives 352, k0=4 (divisor5) gives 175, k0=9 (divisor10) gives 120.\n\nBut note: the minimal k for divisor10 is 9, which is the largest k we considered. But we must consider that the LCM at k0=9 is the smallest.\n\nBut what if we consider non-minimal k's? For example, for divisor10, the next k is 9+10=19. Then the numbers are 21+19=40, 31+19=50. GCD(40,50)=10, LCM=(40*50)//10=200, which is worse than 120.\n\nSimilarly, for divisor5, the next k is 4+5=9, which we already considered.\n\nBut wait, k=9 is generated by divisor10 and divisor5? \n  For divisor5: k0=4, then the next k is 4+5=9. So we can also get k=9 from divisor5. But we already computed k=9 from divisor10, and we would also compute k=9 from divisor5? \n\nBut note: our method only considers the minimal k for each divisor. We are not iterating over all multiples. \n\nBut wait, the problem: the minimal k for divisor5 is 4, but the next k that satisfies divisor5 is 9. However, we are not generating k=9 from divisor5 in our loop because we are only generating the minimal k for each divisor.\n\nBut then, how do we account for k=9 from divisor5? \n\nActually, the condition for divisor5 is that k ≡ (-21) mod 5. -21 mod5 = (-1) mod5 = 4. So the solutions are k=4,9,14,... So the minimal k is 4, and then 9,14,...\n\nBut our method only takes the minimal k (4) for divisor5. We do not consider k=9 from divisor5 because 9 is not the minimal k for divisor5.\n\nBut wait: the divisor5 condition is satisfied by k=4,9,14,... So we must consider k=9? \n\nNo, because we are only concerned with the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. The problem says: if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k. \n\nIn the example (21,31), the minimal LCM is 120, and the smallest k that achieves 120 is 9. So we must consider k=9.\n\nBut how do we generate k=9? \n\nWe generated k=9 from divisor10. But we didn't generate it from divisor5. \n\nBut note: divisor10 is a divisor of d=10, and the minimal k for divisor10 is 9. So we did consider k=9.\n\nBut if we had a divisor that has minimal k=9, we would consider it.\n\nBut what if the minimal k for divisor10 is 9, and the minimal k for divisor5 is 4, and the minimal k for divisor2 is 1, and divisor1 is 0. Then we consider k=0,1,4,9.\n\nBut note: the divisor10 is necessary to get k=9.\n\nBut wait, the divisor5 also leads to k=9 (as the second solution) but we don't generate it from divisor5 because we only take the minimal solution. \n\nBut is that a problem? \n\nNo, because the problem requires the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. We are generating k=9 from divisor10, and that's the smallest k that minimizes the LCM (since k=0,1,4 do not achieve LCM=120). \n\nBut wait, what if there is a divisor that has minimal k=9 and also a divisor that has minimal k=4? Then we consider both. But we are iterating over divisors, and we get k=4 from divisor5 and k=9 from divisor10.\n\nBut what if we miss a k that is not the minimal for any divisor? \n\nExample: Consider a=10, b=16. Then d=6. Divisors:1,2,3,6.\n\nCompute minimal k for each divisor:\n\ng=1: k0=0 -> numbers:10,16 -> gcd=2, LCM=80.\ng=2: k0=0 -> same as above? Actually, 10%2=0, so k0=0. Same as above.\ng=3: k0=(3-10%3)%3=(3-1)%3=2 -> numbers:12,18 -> gcd=6, LCM=36.\ng=6: k0=(6-10%6)%6=(6-4)%6=2 -> same as g=3.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 36, and the smallest k is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about k=5? \n  k=5: 15,21 -> gcd=3, LCM=(15*21)//3=105 -> worse.\n\nBut note: k=2 is the answer.\n\nNow, consider k=8: \n  k=8: 18,2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is constant (\\( a - b \\)). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) must divide this difference. Therefore, the possible GCD values are the divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), we can compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\). Once we have \\( k \\), we compute the LCM of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) using their GCD.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of \\( a \\) and \\( a \\) is \\( a \\).\n   - Otherwise, factorize \\( |a - b| \\) to get all its divisors.\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that makes \\( g \\) a divisor of both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each candidate \\( k \\) and keep track of the minimal LCM encountered, along with the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The factorization step involves checking all numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{d} \\), where \\( d = |a - b| \\). The number of divisors of \\( d \\) is \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\), which is feasible since \\( d \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\). Each divisor requires a GCD computation, which is efficient using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d:\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_k = 0\n    x0 = a + best_k\n    y0 = b + best_k\n    g0 = gcd(x0, y0)\n    best_lcm = (x0 * y0) // g0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        x_val = a + k0\n        y_val = b + k0\n        current_g = gcd(x_val, y_val)\n        current_lcm = (x_val * y_val) // current_g\n        \n        if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n            best_k = k0\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), it immediately returns \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself.\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: The code calculates all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( |a - b| \\).\n4. **Initial Setup**: The initial best \\( k \\) is set to \\( 0 \\), and the corresponding LCM is computed for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n5. **Iterating Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest \\( k \\) that makes \\( g \\) a divisor of both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is computed. The LCM for these values is then calculated.\n6. **Tracking Minimum LCM**: The code keeps track of the smallest LCM encountered and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n7. **Output**: Finally, the smallest \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging the divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large values.",
