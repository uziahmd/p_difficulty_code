Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. So total data is at most 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n\n We are to find all integers p in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying when:\n   (1) The current file's progress is p: floor(100 * x / a_i) = p   for some x from 0 to a_i (but note: we update after each byte, so x is an integer from 0 to a_i)\n   (2) The overall progress is p: floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_bytes) = p\n\n However, note that the overall progress uses the sum of bytes from all files so far (including the current file partially) and the total of all files.\n\n But note: the overall progress uses the entire set of files (all n). So the denominator is fixed: total = sum(a_i).\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since the total size is not too large (<=100000) and the number of files is at most 100, we can simulate the entire process in terms of events (each byte copy) but that would be 100000 events which is acceptable? However, note that we only care about the values of p (from 0 to 100) and we want to know if at any moment both bars show the same p.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n For a given p, we need to check if there exists a time (i.e., after having copied a certain amount from the first k files and some part of the (k+1)-th file) such that:\n\n   Condition 1: In the current file (say the i-th file) we have:\n        p <= (100 * x) / a_i < p+1\n        => ceil((p * a_i) / 100) <= x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1) / 100)   [But note: the floor condition is exactly p when x is in [ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor((p+1)*a_i - 1)]? Actually, we require floor(100*x/a_i) = p.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n          p <= 100*x / a_i < p+1\n        => (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n        Since x is integer, then x must be in [ceil((p * a_i)/100), floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]? \n\n        But note: floor(100*x/a_i) = p  <=>  p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1.\n\n        So x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [if (p * a_i) is divisible by 100 then x_min = (p*a_i)//100, but actually ceil might be the smallest integer >= (p*a_i)/100]\n        and x_max = floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1) / 100)   [because x must be less than (p+1)*a_i/100]\n\n        However, note: if (p+1)*a_i is an integer, then the maximum x is (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1? Actually, we can write:\n\n        x must satisfy: \n          x >= ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [if (p * a_i) % 100 == 0 then ceil gives (p*a_i)//100, else it's the next integer]\n          x < (p+1)*a_i/100   -> so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) ?\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n          x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because ceil(q) = (q + 99)//100 if q is positive? Not exactly, but for integer division we can do: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, but here we have 100*x/a_i, so let me reframe:]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [This gives the ceiling of (p * a_i)/100? Let me check: if (p*a_i) is divisible by 100, then (p*a_i+99)//100 = (p*a_i)//100. If not, then it rounds up. But wait: \n          Example: p*a_i = 150, then (150+99)//100 = 249//100 = 2, but ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n          But if p*a_i=200, then (200+99)//100 = 299//100 = 2, but ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        Actually, the standard formula for ceiling of n/m is (n+m-1)//m. Here m=100, so ceiling of (p*a_i/100) is (p*a_i + 99) // 100.\n\n        Similarly, the upper bound for x is the maximum integer strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100, so:\n\n          x_max = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100) - 1   ??? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, we require x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the largest integer x satisfying that is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9). But note: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is an integer, and x must be at most that integer minus one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100   ??? \n\n        But note: we are working with integers. The condition is 100*x < (p+1)*a_i. Then x <= floor(( (p+1)*a_i - 1 ) / 100) because if 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, then x < (p+1)*a_i/100, and the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) = (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100, but if divisible, then we take (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, then we subtract one? But wait, if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i = 100*k, then the condition is 100*x < 100*k -> x < k, so x_max = k-1 = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        However, if not divisible, then (p+1)*a_i = 100*k + r (0 < r < 100), then condition is 100*x < 100*k + r -> x <= k, and k = (p+1)*a_i//100 (floor division). So then x_max = k.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n          x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0, then x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100, else x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - (1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else 0)\n\n        But note: we must also ensure x_max does not exceed a_i.\n\n        So for the current file i, the amount x (from 0 to a_i) must be in the interval [x_min, x_max] (if this interval is non-empty).\n\n Now, the second condition: the overall progress is p.\n\n   Let S = total_bytes = sum(a_j for j=1..n)\n   Let T = the total bytes copied so far (which is the sum of all previous complete files and the current x bytes).\n\n   Then: floor(100 * T / S) = p   <=> p <= 100*T/S < p+1.\n\n   This implies:\n\n        T_min = ceil(p * S / 100)   [but note: T must be an integer, and the condition is floor(100*T/S)=p, so 100*T/S >= p and < p+1]\n\n        Actually, the condition is: p <= (100*T)/S < p+1\n\n        => T_min = ceil(p * S / 100)   [the smallest T such that 100*T/S >= p] but note: if p*S/100 is an integer, then T_min = p*S/100, otherwise the next integer.\n\n        But wait: floor(100*T/S)=p  <=> p <= 100*T/S < p+1\n\n        <=> T >= ceil(p * S / 100) and T < ceil((p+1)*S/100)   ? \n\n        Actually, we can express T as:\n\n          T_min = ceil(p * S / 100)\n          T_max = floor( ((p+1)*S - 1) / 100 )   [because 100*T/S < p+1  => T < (p+1)*S/100, so T <= floor((p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n        However, note: the condition is 100*T/S < p+1, so T < (p+1)*S/100. The maximum T is floor((p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*S//100 if (p+1)*S % 100 != 0, else (p+1)*S//100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          T_min = (p * S + 99) // 100   [ceiling of p*S/100, using the same trick as above for ceiling]\n          T_max = (p+1)*S // 100 - 1   if (p+1)*S % 100 == 0, then we subtract one? Actually, no: the condition is T < (p+1)*S/100, so T_max = floor((p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*S - 1) // 100   [but wait, we can use:]\n\n        Actually, we can compute T_min and T_max for the overall progress as:\n\n          T_min = ceil(p * S / 100) = (p * S + 99) // 100\n          T_max = floor((p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9) = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100   [because floor(x - epsilon) is the same as floor((x-1)) if we are dealing with integers? But note: (p+1)*S is integer, so (p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9 is just a little less than (p+1)*S/100. Then floor is the integer part. Alternatively, we can use: T_max = (p+1)*S - 1) // 100, but that is not the same.\n\n        Let me clarify: We want the largest integer T such that 100*T < (p+1)*S.\n\n        Then T_max = floor(( (p+1)*S - 1 ) / 100) = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100.\n\n        Why? Because (p+1)*S is integer, so (p+1)*S - 1 is integer. Then floor((p+1)*S/100) is (p+1)*S//100, but we need the floor of (p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9, which is (p+1)*S//100 if (p+1)*S % 100 != 0, and (p+1)*S//100 - 1 if divisible.\n\n        But note: ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100 is equal to (p+1)*S//100 - (1 // 100) ... no, integer division is floor. Actually:\n\n          (p+1)*S = k*100 + r, where 0<=r<100.\n          Then (p+1)*S - 1 = k*100 + (r-1) if r>=1, then (p+1)*S-1 = k*100 + (r-1) and divided by 100 gives k + (r-1)//100 = k (since r-1 in [0,98]), so floor((p+1)*S-1)/100 = k.\n\n          But if r==0, then (p+1)*S-1 = k*100 -1, then (p+1)*S-1 = (k-1)*100 + 99, then floor((p+1)*S-1)/100 = k-1.\n\n        So indeed, ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100 gives the floor of (p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9.\n\n        However, note: the condition is 100*T < (p+1)*S, so T < (p+1)*S/100, then T <= floor((p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9) = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100.\n\n        So T_min = (p * S + 99) // 100\n        T_max = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100\n\n        But note: T_max must be at least T_min? And also T_max must be at least the total of the previous files (if any) and at most the total of the first k files plus the current x (which is at most a_i).\n\n However, the catch: the moment must occur during the copying of the files in order. The overall progress T is the sum of the first (i-1) files (completely) and then x bytes of the i-th file.\n\n So we must have:\n\n   Let prefix_sum[i] = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{i-1}   (for the i-th file, the previous files' total)\n\n   Then T = prefix_sum[i] + x.\n\n   Conditions for the current file i and x:\n\n        Condition 1: x must be in [x_min, x_max] (as defined above for the current file i and p)\n        Condition 2: T = prefix_sum[i] + x must be in [T_min, T_max] (for the overall progress p)\n\n   And note: x must be between 0 and a_i, and also T_min <= prefix_sum[i] + x <= T_max.\n\n   Also, the current file is being copied, so x must be at least 0 and at most a_i.\n\n   Moreover, we must consider that the overall progress condition must be satisfied at the same moment (same x).\n\n How to check for a fixed p?\n\n   We iterate over the files i (from 1 to n) and then over the possible x that satisfy the current file condition, and check if T = prefix_sum[i] + x is in [T_min, T_max].\n\n   But note: the overall T_min and T_max are computed from the total S (fixed). \n\n   However, we can also iterate by the file index and then by the x in the allowed range for the current file.\n\n   But note: the overall progress condition must hold at the same moment, so T must be exactly prefix_sum[i] + x and that must be in [T_min, T_max].\n\n   Steps for a fixed p:\n\n      Step 1: Compute T_min = (p * S + 99) // 100\n              T_max = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100\n\n      Step 2: For each file i (0-indexed):\n\n          Let prefix = (if i==0 then 0, else sum(a_0 to a_{i-1}))\n          Then the current file is a_i, and we require that x (bytes copied in this file) satisfies:\n               x_min_file = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n               x_max_file = ( (p+1)*a_i - 1 ) // 100   [this is the same formula as T_max but for the current file]\n\n          But note: if (p+1)*a_i is 0? No, a_i>=1, and p from 0 to 100.\n\n          Then the x must be in [x_min_file, min(a_i, x_max_file)] and also x must be such that T = prefix + x is in [T_min, T_max].\n\n          However, note: the overall progress condition must hold, so we require T_min <= prefix+x <= T_max.\n\n          Additionally, x must be at least 0 and at most a_i.\n\n      Step 3: If we find at least one file i and one x (within the allowed range for the current file) such that T_min <= prefix+x <= T_max, then p is valid.\n\n   But note: the same p might be achieved at multiple moments, but we only need one.\n\n   However, what if the current file condition and the overall condition are not satisfied at the same x? Then we move to the next file.\n\n   But note: the same p might appear in different files? Actually, the overall progress condition is global (depends on the total S) and the current file condition is local (depends on the current file).\n\n   Example: two files, and p=50. It might be achieved in the first file (if the first file is large enough) or in the second file (if the first file was small and the second file pushes the overall progress to 50).\n\n   But note: the overall progress condition is independent of the file index (it depends on the total S and the cumulative sum). However, the current file condition depends on the current file.\n\n   However, note: the moment must be during the copying of one particular file. We must check for each file.\n\n   But note: the overall progress condition must be satisfied at the same moment (so the cumulative sum must be in [T_min, T_max]) and the current file condition must be satisfied (x in [x_min_file, x_max_file]).\n\n   However, there is a catch: the overall progress condition uses the entire set of files (all n) and the current file condition uses only the current file.\n\n   But note: the entire set of files is known (we know S). So we can precompute S.\n\n   Steps for the entire solution:\n\n      Read n\n      Read list a of n integers.\n\n      Let S = sum(a)\n\n      Precompute prefix sums: \n          prefix[0] = 0\n          prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1} for the i-th file (0-indexed, so for the i-th file, we use prefix[i])\n\n      Then, for p from 0 to 100:\n\n          T_min = (p * S + 99) // 100\n          T_max = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100\n\n          If T_min > T_max: then skip p (actually, this should not happen because (p*S+99)//100 <= ((p+1)*S-1)//100? Let's check: \n            p*S/100 <= (p+1)*S/100 - 1/100? \n            => 100*p*S <= 100*(p+1)*S - 100?\n            => 0 <= 100*S - 100, which is true since S>=1. But note: when S is 0? but n>=1 and a_i>=1, so S>=1.\n\n          Then, for each file index i (0-indexed):\n\n              Let prev_total = prefix[i]   (the sum of files 0 to i-1)\n\n              Then the current file is a[i]. The x (bytes in this file) must satisfy:\n\n                  x_min_cur = (p * a[i] + 99) // 100\n                  x_max_cur = ( (p+1)*a[i] - 1 ) // 100\n\n              Then the x must be in [max(0, x_min_cur), min(a[i], x_max_cur)] (but note: x_min_cur might be 0, and x_max_cur might be negative? no, because p>=0 and a[i]>=1, so (p*a[i]+99)//100 is at least 0, and ( (p+1)*a[i]-1 )//100 is at least ( (1)*1 -1 )//100 = 0//100=0, but if p=0 and a[i]=1: then x_min_cur = (0+99)//100 = 0, x_max_cur = (1-1)//100 = 0, so x=0 is allowed.\n\n              Then, for each candidate x in the continuous range [x_min_cur, x_max_cur] (but note: we don't need to iterate over every integer if the range is large; however, the maximum a[i] is 1000, so the range is at most 1000 numbers, and we have at most 100 files, so 100*1000=100000 per p, and p from 0 to 100 (101 values) -> 101 * 100000 = 10.1e6, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we can avoid iterating by checking the intersection of intervals.)\n\n          Actually, we don't need to iterate over every x. We can check:\n\n              The total T = prev_total + x must be in [T_min, T_max] and x in [x_min_cur, x_max_cur] and x in [0, a[i]].\n\n          The condition for x is:\n\n              x >= max(x_min_cur, T_min - prev_total)   [because T_min <= prev_total+x => x>= T_min - prev_total]\n              x <= min(x_max_cur, T_max - prev_total)   [because T_max >= prev_total+x => x<= T_max - prev_total]\n\n          Then, if the interval [L, R] = [max(x_min_cur, T_min - prev_total), min(x_max_cur, T_max - prev_total)] is non-empty and within [0, a[i]], then p is achieved.\n\n          But note: x must be an integer, and the interval is integer. So we need to check if there exists an integer x in [L, R] (with L<=R) and 0<=x<=a[i].\n\n          However, note: x_min_cur and x_max_cur are computed from the current file, and T_min and T_max are computed from the total S.\n\n          Steps for a fixed p and file i:\n\n            Let L1 = max(x_min_cur, T_min - prev_total, 0)\n            Let R1 = min(x_max_cur, T_max - prev_total, a[i])\n\n            Then if L1 <= R1, then there exists an x that satisfies both conditions.\n\n          But wait: is that correct?\n\n          Conditions for x:\n\n            Condition from current file: x in [x_min_cur, x_max_cur] and x in [0, a[i]]\n            Condition from overall: T_min <= prev_total+x <= T_max  => x in [T_min - prev_total, T_max - prev_total] (and note T_min and T_max are fixed, and prev_total is fixed)\n\n          Then the intersection is [max(x_min_cur, T_min - prev_total, 0), min(x_max_cur, T_max - prev_total, a[i])]\n\n          Then if the lower bound <= the upper bound, then we have an x.\n\n          However, note: the condition from the current file is independent and must be satisfied. But the overall condition requires that the cumulative sum (prev_total+x) is in [T_min, T_max]. \n\n          Example: p=0.\n\n            T_min = (0*S+99)//100 = 0\n            T_max = (1*S-1)//100\n\n            For the first file: \n                x_min_cur = (0*a0+99)//100 = 0\n                x_max_cur = (1*a0-1)//100\n\n            Then x must be in [0, min(a0, (a0-1)//100)]? \n\n            But note: (a0-1)//100 is 0 for a0=1, and for a0>1, if a0<=100 then (a0-1)//100=0, if a0=101 then (101-1)//100=100//100=1.\n\n            Then the condition for the current file is x in [0, min(a0, (a0-1)//100)].\n\n            Then the overall condition requires x>= T_min - prev_total = 0 - 0 = 0, and x<= T_max - 0 = (S-1)//100.\n\n            Now, the cumulative sum T = x (since first file) must be <= (S-1)//100. But note: we are at the beginning, and we are copying the first byte: then T=1, and then floor(100*1/S) = 0 only if 100*1/S < 1, i.e., S>100. \n\n            So if S>100, then at x=1 the overall progress is 0, but the current file condition for x=1: \n                floor(100*1/a0) = 0 only if a0>100 (because 100*1/a0 < 1 when a0>100). \n\n            So the condition for the current file and overall progress to be 0 is that the current file has been copied 0 bytes? \n\n            Actually, at x=0, the current file shows 0% and the overall shows 0%. So that's always the case at the very beginning. But note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", and the beginning is included.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so the beginning (0 bytes) is included.\n\n            So for p=0, we always have the initial state.\n\n            But wait, the example outputs: the first example output includes 0, then 16, etc.\n\n            Therefore, we must include p=0.\n\n            However, our method for p=0:\n\n              T_min = (0*S+99)//100 = 0\n              T_max = (1*S-1)//100\n\n              Then for the first file (prev_total=0):\n                  x_min_cur = 0\n                  x_max_cur = (S-1)//100   (if we use the formula for the current file: (p+1)*a0-1)//100 = (1*a0-1)//100, but note: our T_max is (S-1)//100, and the current file condition is (1*a0-1)//100, which is independent of S.\n\n              Then the condition for the current file is x in [0, min(a0, (a0-1)//100)]\n\n              But note: the overall condition requires x in [0, T_max] (because T_min=0, and T_max=(S-1)//100). \n\n              However, the current file condition requires x <= (a0-1)//100, which is much smaller if a0 is small.\n\n              Then the intersection is [0, min(a0, (a0-1)//100, (S-1)//100)].\n\n              But note: the overall condition requires x<= (S-1)//100, and the current condition requires x<= (a0-1)//100.\n\n              So the intersection is [0, min(a0, (a0-1)//100, (S-1)//100)]. \n\n              However, the condition for the overall progress to be 0 is that the cumulative T (which is x) is in [0, (S-1)//100]. Since x is at least 0 and at most min(a0, (a0-1)//100) (which is <= (a0-1)//100) and (a0-1)//100 <= (S-1)//100? Not necessarily, but we take the minimum.\n\n              But note: the condition for the current file is more restrictive than the overall condition for the first byte? \n\n            Actually, the issue is: the condition for the overall progress being 0 is that 100*x/S < 1, i.e., x < S/100. So if S>100, then x=0,1,..., floor(S/100 - 1) [because x must be less than S/100] -> but wait, the condition is floor(100*x/S)=0, so 0<=100*x/S <1 -> x < S/100.\n\n            The condition for the current file being 0 is: 100*x/a0 < 1 -> x < a0/100.\n\n            Therefore, the moment when x=0 is always included (both conditions are 0). So we don't need to worry.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", and the initial state (x=0) is always there. So p=0 is always present.\n\n            Similarly, p=100 is the end. At the end, the cumulative T=S, then the overall progress is floor(100*S/S)=100. And the last file: at x=a_n, the current file condition: floor(100*a_n/a_n)=100. So p=100 is always present.\n\n            But wait, what if we have multiple files? The overall progress reaches 100 only at the very end (when all files are copied). Similarly, the current file condition for the last file at x=a_n is 100. So yes.\n\n            Therefore, we must include 0 and 100.\n\n   Algorithm for fixed p:\n\n        T_min = (p * S + 99) // 100\n        T_max = ( (p+1)*S - 1 ) // 100\n\n        # If T_min > T_max, then skip (but as reasoned, T_min <= T_max because (p*S+99)//100 <= (p*S+99) < (p+1)*S, and (p*S+99)//100 <= (p*S+99) < (p+1)*S, so T_min <= (p*S+99)//100, and T_max = ( (p+1)*S - 1 )//100, which is at least (p*S + 100*S - 1)//100, but we know (p*S+99)//100 <= (p*S+99) and (p*S+99) < (p+1)*S (if S>0) so T_min <= (p*S+99) < (p+1)*S, and T_max = ( (p+1)*S-1 )//100 >= (p*S+100*S-1)//100, but that doesn't directly compare. Actually, we must ensure T_min <= T_max. Since (p*S+99)//100 <= (p*S+99) and (p+1)*S-1 >= p*S+99? Not necessarily.\n\n        Let me check: \n            T_min = (p*S+99)//100\n            T_max = ( (p+1)*S-1 )//100\n\n            We require T_min <= T_max.\n\n            Note: (p*S+99)//100 is the ceiling of p*S/100, and ( (p+1)*S-1 )//100 is the floor of (p+1)*S/100 - 1e-9.\n\n            We know that the interval [p*S/100, (p+1)*S/100) has length S/100, which is at least 1 (since S>=1, but p can be 100, then S/100 might be fractional). Actually, the length is S/100, which is >=0.01 (minimum) but we are dealing with integers.\n\n            However, note that T_min and T_max are defined such that T_min is the smallest integer T such that 100*T/S >= p, and T_max is the largest integer T such that 100*T/S < p+1.\n\n            Then by definition, T_min <= T_max because the condition for T_min is 100*T_min/S >= p and for T_max is 100*T_max/S < p+1, and note that T_min and T_max are consecutive integers? Not necessarily, but we know that the real interval [p*S/100, (p+1)*S/100) is non-empty (unless S=0, which we don't have). And T_min is the ceiling of the left endpoint, and T_max is the floor of the right endpoint minus epsilon. So if the interval [p*S/100, (p+1)*S/100) has length S/100, then T_min and T_max are defined appropriately.\n\n            However, if the interval [p*S/100, (p+1)*S/100) contains no integer? Then T_min > T_max. But note: the length is S/100, and if S/100 < 1, then the interval might not contain an integer. \n\n            Example: p=0, S=1, then T_min = (0+99)//100 = 0, T_max = (1*1-1)//100 = 0. Then T_min=T_max=0 -> non-empty.\n\n            Example: p=0, S=2, then T_min=0, T_max=(2-1)//100=1//100=0 -> non-empty.\n\n            Example: p=0, S=101, then T_min=0, T_max=(101-1)//100=100//100=1 -> non-empty.\n\n            Example: p=1, S=1, then T_min=(1*1+99)//100=100//100=1, T_max=(2*1-1)//100=1//100=0 -> then T_min=1, T_max=0 -> empty.\n\n            So we must skip p=1 in this case.\n\n            Why? Because the overall progress must be 1 at some point. The total S=1, then the overall progress becomes 1 only when we have copied 1 byte (the entire file). But the condition for the overall progress to be 1 is floor(100*T/1)=100*T, so we need 100*T>=1 and <2. Then T>=1 (since T is integer) and T<2, so T=1. But then the moment is the last byte of the first file (if the first file is the only file). \n\n            However, the current",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that there exists a moment during the copying of files where both the current file's progress and the overall progress bars show the same percentage. The progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, and their values are floor divisions of the respective progress multiplied by 100.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the copying process of multiple files and checking for specific progress percentages. The key insight is that for each percentage `p`, we need to verify if there exists a point during the copying process where:\n   - The current file's progress (percentage completed within its own size) is exactly `p`.\n   - The overall progress (percentage of total data copied so far) is also exactly `p`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each percentage `p` from 0 to 100, compute the minimum (`T_min`) and maximum (`T_max`) cumulative bytes required for the overall progress to be `p`. Then, for each file, check if there exists a number of bytes `x` copied in that file such that:\n   - The current file's progress is `p`.\n   - The cumulative bytes (sum of all previous files plus `x`) falls within `[T_min, T_max]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sums**: Precompute the cumulative sizes of files up to each position to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied before starting each file.\n   - **Range Calculation**: For each `p`, compute the valid range of cumulative bytes (`[T_min, T_max]`) that would result in an overall progress of `p`.\n   - **Intersection Check**: For each file, determine the valid range of bytes (`x`) that would make the current file's progress `p` and check if any `x` in this range also results in a cumulative byte count within `[T_min, T_max]`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each percentage `p` (0 to 100) and each file (up to 100 files). For each `p` and file, it performs constant-time checks, leading to an overall complexity of O(100 * n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_size = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    results = set()\n    for p in range(0, 101):\n        T_min = (p * total_size + 99) // 100\n        T_max = ((p + 1) * total_size - 1) // 100\n        \n        if T_min > T_max:\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for i in range(n):\n            prev_total = prefix[i] if i > 0 else 0\n            file_size = a[i]\n            \n            x_min_cur = (p * file_size + 99) // 100\n            x_max_cur = ((p + 1) * file_size - 1) // 100\n            \n            low_bound = max(x_min_cur, T_min - prev_total, 0)\n            high_bound = min(x_max_cur, T_max - prev_total, file_size)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.add(p)\n            \n    sorted_results = sorted(results)\n    for res in sorted_results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix array stores cumulative file sizes up to each position, allowing quick access to the total bytes before processing each file.\n3. **Percentage Check**: For each percentage `p` from 0 to 100:\n   - Compute the minimum (`T_min`) and maximum (`T_max`) cumulative bytes required for the overall progress to be `p`.\n   - If `T_min` exceeds `T_max`, skip to the next percentage.\n   - For each file, determine the valid range of bytes (`x`) that would make the current file's progress `p` and check if any `x` in this range results in a cumulative byte count within `[T_min, T_max]`.\n4. **Output Results**: Collect all valid percentages in a set to avoid duplicates, sort them, and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible progress percentages by leveraging mathematical calculations and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
