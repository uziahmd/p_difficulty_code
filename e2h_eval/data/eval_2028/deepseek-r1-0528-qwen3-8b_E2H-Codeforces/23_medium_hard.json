In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in one line, but the example input is given as a list of three strings. Actually, the input format is: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string is two characters: digit and then one of 'm', 'p', 's'.\n\n However, note the example input: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning there is one line with three tokens (each token is a string representing a tile). But the example input is shown as three separate strings? \n\n Let me re-read: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input is given as three separate examples.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n So the input will be one line with three tokens. For example:\n   \"1s 2s 3s\"\n   or \n   \"9m 9m 9m\"\n   or \n   \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This might be confusing. Actually, the problem states that the input is one line containing three strings (each string being one tile). But the example input is shown as three separate strings? \n\n Clarification: The input is one line that has three strings (each string is two characters). So we can split the input line by space to get a list of three tiles.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being a single tile. But the problem says the input is one line. \n\n Actually, the example input format is:\n\n Input: \n   1s 2s 3s\n\n But wait, the example shows three examples. The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", so we have one line with three tokens.\n\n Example 1: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"\n Example 2: \"9m 9m 9m\" -> three tiles: \"9m\", \"9m\", \"9m\"\n Example 3: \"3p 9m 2p\" -> three tiles: \"3p\", \"9m\", \"2p\"\n\n So we read one line, split it into three tokens.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split into a list of three strings.\n\n 2. We have three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) in the hand.\n\n Since we can draw any tile arbitrarily many times, we are allowed to form multiple copies of the same tile.\n\n Note: A mentsu is either a koutsu (three identical) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n We are allowed to have more than three tiles. The goal is to have at least one mentsu (a set of three tiles that form either a triplet or a sequence). We can draw as many tiles as we want, but we want the minimum number.\n\n Let's consider possibilities:\n\n Possibility 0: Already have a mentsu? Then we need 0.\n\n Possibility 1: We don't have a mentsu, but we can form one by drawing 1 tile.\n\n Possibility 2: We can form one by drawing 2 tiles.\n\n Possibility 3: We can form one by drawing 3 tiles? Actually, we start with three tiles.\n\n Since we can only draw extra tiles (and we start with three), the total number of tiles after drawing n tiles is 3+n.\n\n We are looking for the smallest n such that there exists a mentsu in the set.\n\n However, note: the definition of mentsu is a set of three tiles (so we don't require all four to be used, just three). And we can use any three from the total set.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose which tiles to use. So we don't need to use all the drawn ones, just have at least one mentsu.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We have three initial tiles. We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Check if we already have a mentsu (n=0)\n\n Option 2: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 1 tile (n=1)\n\n Option 3: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 2 tiles (n=2)\n\n Option 4: Otherwise, n=3? Actually, wait: we can draw 3 tiles and then have six tiles and form a mentsu? But note, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. However, is there a scenario where we cannot form a mentsu until we draw 3?\n\n Let me think: \n\n - To form a koutsu: we need three identical tiles. \n   Example: [1m, 1m, 1m] is already there. If we have [1m, 1m, 2m], then we can draw one 1m to complete the triplet.\n\n - To form a shuntsu: we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n Now, what if we have three different suits? Then we must draw two more tiles to form a shuntsu? Actually, no: \n\n Example: ['1m', '2p', '3s'] \n   We cannot form a shuntsu because the suits are different. \n\n But wait, a shuntsu requires same suit. So we must have the same suit. \n\n Therefore, if the three tiles are not in the same suit, then we must draw at least two tiles to form a shuntsu? Actually, no: we can form a triplet by drawing two more of the same tile? \n\n However, note: a triplet can be formed by having three of the same tile. But the tile must be the same representation. So if we have two different tiles, we can draw two more of the same tile that is already present.\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n We have three tiles. There are two cases:\n\n Case 1: All three tiles are of the same suit.\n Case 2: Not all three tiles are of the same suit.\n\n In Case 1: same suit. Then we can check for both koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n   Koutsu: Count the frequency of each distinct tile (by number). \n        If any number appears three times: then we have a koutsu -> 0.\n\n   Shuntsu: We can arrange the numbers in sorted order and check for consecutive sequences. But note: we can also consider duplicates? Actually, a shuntsu requires three distinct numbers.\n\n        However, if we have duplicates, we can use each tile only once. So we look for three consecutive numbers, regardless of duplicates? Actually, no: we cannot use the same tile twice. \n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 2m, 3m] -> then we can form two shuntsus? But we only need one. However, we are starting with three. \n\n        With three tiles: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> yes. [1m, 1m, 1m] -> no (because we don't have consecutive numbers). [1m, 2m, 2m] -> we cannot form a shuntsu because we need three consecutive and we only have two 2m and one 1m and one 3m missing? Actually, we don't have 3m. \n\n        How about [1m, 2m, 2m]? We have two 2m. We can form a shuntsu if we have 1m, 2m, 3m. We are missing 3m. So we need to draw 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,2m,3m] and we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using one 2m). But note, we are only required to have one mentsu. So we can use the drawn tile to complete the shuntsu.\n\n        However, we started with three, then we draw one, so total four. But the question is: what is the minimum draws.\n\n        So in Case 1 (same suit) without a koutsu, we can consider:\n\n          - Check if we can form a shuntsu by drawing 0, 1, or 2 tiles.\n\n        Steps for same suit:\n\n          Step 1: Group by number (ignore suit since they are same).\n\n          Step 2: Sort the numbers.\n\n          Step 3: Check if there's already a consecutive sequence (shuntsu) of three distinct numbers (with no gaps) and we have at least one of each.\n\n          But note: we can have duplicates, so we can only use each tile once.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3] -> yes.\n                   [1,1,1] -> koutsu already, so handled above.\n                   [1,1,2] -> we have two 1s and one 2. Then we can form a shuntsu if we have a 3? But we don't. So we need to draw a 3. Then we have [1,1,2,3]. Then we can use the 1,2,3. But wait, we have two 1s, so we can use one 1, the 2, and the 3. So we need one draw.\n\n          However, what about drawing two? Maybe we can form two different mentsus? But we only need one. So we are concerned with the minimal.\n\n          But note: we can also form a koutsu by drawing two more of the same tile. \n\n          For [1,1,2]: \n            Option 1: Draw two 1s -> then we have [1,1,2,1,1] -> then we can form a koutsu [1,1,1] (we don't even need all five). So we can form a koutsu by drawing two.\n\n          So for [1,1,2] (same suit), the answer could be min(1,2) = 1 (because we can form a shuntsu by drawing 1).\n\n          However, wait: how do we form a shuntsu with [1,1,2] by drawing one? We draw a 3, then we have [1,1,2,3]. Then we can form [1,2,3]. But note: we have two 1s, so we can use one of them. That works.\n\n          But what if the three tiles are [1,2,4] (same suit)? \n            Check koutsu: no.\n            Check shuntsu: \n                Sort: [1,2,4] -> no consecutive three. \n                What can we do?\n                Option: draw one tile. We can draw a 3 -> then we have [1,2,3,4]. Then we can form [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. So one draw.\n\n            Alternatively, draw two tiles to form a koutsu? \n                We can draw two 1s: then we have [1,1,1,2,4] -> koutsu [1,1,1] -> two draws.\n\n            Or two 2s: [1,2,2,2,4] -> koutsu [2,2,2] -> two draws.\n\n            Or two 4s: [1,2,4,4,4] -> koutsu [4,4,4] -> two draws.\n\n            So the minimum is 1.\n\n          Another example: [1,2,4] -> one draw.\n\n        How about [1,3,4] (same suit)?\n            Sort: [1,3,4] -> no consecutive three.\n            To form a shuntsu, we can draw 2: then [1,2,3,4] -> then we have [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. But wait, we don't have a 2 initially. So we need to draw a 2. Then we have [1,2,3,4] and we can form [1,2,3] (using the 1, the drawn 2, and the 3). So one draw.\n\n        But wait, we can also form a koutsu? We don't have three of any. So no.\n\n        However, what if we have [1,1,4] (same suit)? \n            koutsu: no.\n            shuntsu: [1,1,4] -> we can form a shuntsu by drawing 2 and 3? That would be two draws. Alternatively, we can form a koutsu by drawing two 1s (then we have three 1s) -> two draws.\n\n            But wait, can we form a shuntsu with one draw? \n                We can draw a 2 and a 3? Actually, we can only draw one tile at a time, but we are considering the minimum number of draws. We are allowed to draw multiple tiles arbitrarily. However, we are counting the total draws.\n\n            Actually, we are allowed to draw one tile at a time, but we can plan for multiple draws. However, the minimal number of draws is the minimal n such that after n draws we have a mentsu.\n\n            So for [1,1,4] (same suit): \n                n=0: no\n                n=1: \n                    We can draw one tile. What tile? \n                    To form a koutsu: we can draw two more 1s? No, we can only draw one. Then we have two 1s and one 4. Not enough for koutsu.\n                    To form a shuntsu: we need three consecutive. We have 1 and 4. The consecutive sequences that include 1 are [0,1,2] (but 0 doesn't exist) or [1,2,3]. Similarly, for 4: [2,3,4] or [3,4,5]. \n\n                    We can draw a 2: then we have [1,1,2,4]. Then we can form [1,2,?] but we don't have a 3. \n                    We can draw a 3: then we have [1,1,3,4]. Then we can form [3,4,?] but we don't have a 5, and we don't have a consecutive sequence of three.\n\n                    Alternatively, draw a 1: then we have [1,1,1,4] -> koutsu! So we can form a koutsu by drawing one 1.\n\n                    But wait, the tile is represented as '1m' or whatever. So if the suit is fixed (say 'm'), then drawing '1m' is allowed. So we can draw one tile to form a koutsu.\n\n                    Therefore, for [1,1,4] (same suit) we can do it in 1 draw.\n\n            Correction: I thought we needed two 1s to form a koutsu, but actually we need three. We have two 1s, so one more 1 makes three.\n\n        Therefore, for same suit:\n\n          We can have two ways to form a mentsu: koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Let the three tiles (converted to numbers) be [a, b, c] (all same suit).\n\n          First, check koutsu: \n            If there are three of the same number: 0 draws.\n\n          Else, we consider:\n\n            Option 1: Draw one tile to form a koutsu: \n                For each distinct number x that appears at least once, if we draw two more of x, then we have three. But wait, we can only draw one tile. So we can only complete a koutsu if we have two of one kind and then we draw the third. Actually, we can also complete a koutsu if we have one of a kind and we draw two? But that takes two draws.\n\n                Actually, to form a koutsu by drawing one tile: we must have two of one kind and then draw the last one. Because we start with three tiles.\n\n                Example: [1,1,2] -> we can draw one 1 to get [1,1,1,2] (so koutsu). \n\n            Option 2: Draw one tile to form a shuntsu: \n                We need to complete a consecutive sequence. The consecutive sequence must be three numbers. We have some numbers. We can consider the gaps.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider: \n\n            We are going to consider the entire set (including drawn tiles) and we are allowed to draw up to 3 tiles (since we start with three, and we can draw up to 3? Actually, we can draw more, but we want the minimum).\n\n          However, note: we can draw as many as we want, but we are looking for the minimum.\n\n          We know that:\n\n            With 0 draws: if we have a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n            With 1 draw: if we can form a koutsu (by having two of one kind and drawing one) OR form a shuntsu (by having two numbers that are consecutive and missing one in the middle, or having two non-consecutive numbers and then we can complete a sequence by drawing two adjacent numbers? Actually, no: we are only drawing one.\n\n          Actually, for shuntsu with one draw: \n            We need to complete a consecutive sequence of three. \n\n            Possibilities:\n\n            Case A: We have two numbers that are consecutive and we are missing one. For example, [1,2,4]: we have 1,2,4. The consecutive sequences that include these: \n                [1,2,3] is missing 3. \n                [2,3,4] is missing 3.\n\n            So drawing 3 completes two potential shuntsus.\n\n            Case B: We have two numbers that are two apart (like [1,3,?]) and then we can complete by drawing the middle one? But wait, we need three consecutive. So [1,3,?] alone isn't enough. We need three numbers. \n\n            Actually, we have three numbers. We can break the three numbers into groups. \n\n          How about we try to see if there's a way to form a shuntsu with one draw:\n\n            Let the set of numbers be S (after removing duplicates? No, because we have three tiles, but duplicates matter). \n\n            Actually, we have three numbers (possibly with duplicates). We can use each tile only once.\n\n            We need to cover three consecutive numbers. \n\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3. Then we use one 1, the 2, and the 3. So yes.\n\n            Example: [1,3,3] -> we can form [2,3,4] by drawing 2 and 4? But that's two draws. Alternatively, we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 2. Then we use the 1, the drawn 2, and one 3. So one draw.\n\n            Example: [1,3,3] -> one draw.\n\n          So the condition for shuntsu with one draw: \n\n            There exists a consecutive sequence (x, x+1, x+2) such that the hand (three tiles) has at least one tile from two of the three numbers, and the missing one can be drawn.\n\n            But note: we have three tiles. We can use duplicates to our advantage? \n\n            Actually, we can use one tile per number. So if we have two 3s, then we can use two of the three numbers from the existing tiles and the third from the draw.\n\n            Conditions for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n            Let the three numbers be a, b, c (all in the same suit). \n\n            We can consider every consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) that is possible (from 1 to 7, because 9 is the maximum, so x+2<=9).\n\n            Then, in the set {a,b,c}, we must have at least two distinct numbers from the triplet (and we can use duplicates if available). But note: we have three tiles, so we can use duplicates.\n\n            Actually, we can represent the hand as a multiset.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n            Let T = {x, x+1, x+2}. We need to check if the hand has at least one tile for two of the three numbers, but note: if a number appears twice, then we can use two tiles of that number.\n\n            However, we are only concerned with the existence of three consecutive numbers. We can use:\n\n                count = 0\n                for num in T:\n                    if num in hand_numbers (or the multiset) then we can use one occurrence.\n\n            But wait, we have three tiles. We need to cover three consecutive numbers. We can use:\n\n                Condition: the hand has at least one of x, one of x+1, and one of x+2.\n\n            However, if the hand has duplicates, we might have two of one number. Then we can use that duplicate to cover two different requirements? \n\n            Actually, no: because the three consecutive numbers must be distinct. So we need one tile from x, one from x+1, and one from x+2.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two of x? Then we can use two of x for two different sequences? But we are forming one sequence. We only need one tile per number.\n\n            So we need at least one tile with number x, one with x+1, and one with x+2.\n\n            But we have three tiles. So we can have:\n\n                [x, x+1, x+2] -> already have the sequence.\n\n                Or, we can have two of one number and one of the others. But if we have two of x, then we have two tiles for x, and then we need one for x+1 and one for x+2. But we only have three tiles. So if we have two x and one x+1, then we are missing x+2.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for one-draw shuntsu is:\n\n                There exists a triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that the hand has at least one of x, one of x+1, and one of x+2. \n\n            But wait, if we don't have one of them, then we cannot form the sequence without drawing. However, we are allowed to draw one tile, so we can complete one missing number.\n\n            Actually, we are missing one of the three numbers. So if we have two of the three numbers, then we can draw the missing one.\n\n            Therefore, for a given triplet (x, x+1, x+2), the hand must have at least two distinct numbers from the triplet (and the two distinct numbers must be present, possibly with duplicates). \n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. We can use one tile per number. So we need to check:\n\n                Let the hand have a multiset of three numbers. We need to check if the hand has at least one occurrence of two distinct numbers in the triplet.\n\n            But wait: what if the hand has two of the same number? Then we have two of x. Then we need one of x+1 and one of x+2. But we only have three tiles: two are x, and one is something else. Then the something else must be either x+1 or x+2. Then we are missing one. So we can draw the missing one.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for one-draw shuntsu is:\n\n                There exists a triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that the hand does not contain all three numbers, but contains at least two distinct numbers (which may be repeated) from the triplet. \n\n            However, note: we are only missing one number. So:\n\n                Let M = {x, x+1, x+2}\n                Let S = set of distinct numbers in the hand that are in M.\n\n                Then, if |S| >= 2, then we can complete the triplet by drawing the missing one (if any) or if we have two distinct numbers and one duplicate, then we are missing one.\n\n            Actually, we don't require the two distinct numbers to be the entire M without the duplicate. We just need to cover two distinct numbers (any two) and then we can use the duplicate to help? \n\n            Example: [x, x, x+1] -> then we have two distinct numbers: x and x+1. Then we are missing x+2. So we can draw x+2.\n\n            Example: [x, x+1, x+1] -> same.\n\n            Example: [x, x, x+2] -> then we have two distinct numbers: x and x+2. Then we are missing x+1. So we can draw x+1.\n\n            Example: [x, x+1, x+2] -> already have the triplet.\n\n            But wait, [x, x, x] -> then we don't have two distinct numbers from the triplet? Then we cannot form a shuntsu by drawing one.\n\n            So the condition is: the hand (the three tiles) must have at least two distinct numbers that are part of the triplet (x, x+1, x+2). \n\n            However, note: we can also have the same number appearing twice and one other number that is one of the two others. \n\n            Algorithm for same-suit case:\n\n            Step 1: Check for koutsu (triplet): \n                Let counts = frequency of each number (each distinct tile value, ignoring suit because same)\n                If any count>=3: then 0.\n\n            Step 2: Check for shuntsu (sequence) without drawing: \n                Sort the distinct numbers (or the list) and check if there is a consecutive sequence of three distinct numbers (ignoring duplicates). But note: if there are duplicates, we can use one occurrence per number.\n\n                Actually, we need three distinct numbers that are consecutive.\n\n                Example: [1,2,3] -> yes.\n                         [1,2,2] -> we have 1,2 -> missing 3, so no.\n\n                But wait, we have three tiles. We can use one occurrence of each. So we need to check if the set of numbers (without duplicates) has three consecutive numbers? \n\n                Example: [1,2,3] -> set {1,2,3} -> consecutive -> yes.\n                         [1,2,4] -> set {1,2,4} -> not consecutive -> no.\n\n                However, what if we have [1,2,2]? Then the set is {1,2} -> not consecutive.\n\n            Step 3: Check for one-draw:\n\n                For koutsu: \n                    We can form a koutsu if there exists a number x that appears at least twice (so that drawing one more makes three). Then we can do it in 1 draw.\n\n                For shuntsu:\n                    We can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that the hand (the three tiles) has at least two distinct numbers from this triplet.\n\n            Step 4: Check for two-draw:\n\n                We can form a koutsu by drawing two tiles (if no koutsu already and no one-draw koutsu) or a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                But note: we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles even if we have a one-draw koutsu? We are looking for the minimum.\n\n                However, we are checking in increasing order: first 0, then 1, then 2, then 3.\n\n            But wait, the problem allows drawing any tiles arbitrarily. We are to find the minimum.\n\n            We can also consider: sometimes two draws might be necessary even if one-draw koutsu is not available, but one-draw shuntsu is not available.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1] -> already koutsu (0 draws) -> done.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] (same suit): \n                0: no (no koutsu and no shuntsu because set {1,2} is not consecutive)\n                1: \n                    koutsu: we have two 1's, so drawing one 1 -> koutsu -> 1 draw.\n                    shuntsu: we have {1,2}. We are missing a 3 for [1,2,3] or [0,1,2] (invalid). So we can draw 3 -> then we have [1,1,2,3] and we can form [1,2,3] (using one 1, the 2, and the 3) -> 1 draw.\n\n                So we have two options for one draw. Therefore, we can do 1 draw.\n\n            Example: [1,1,4] (same suit): \n                0: no.\n                1: \n                    koutsu: two 1's -> draw one 1 -> koutsu -> 1 draw.\n                    shuntsu: we have {1,4}. We can form [3,4,5] by drawing 3 and 5? But that's two draws. Or [2,3,4] by drawing 2 and 3? Also two. Or [1,2,3] by drawing 2 and 3? Two. \n                    But wait: we can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile? \n                        We need to complete a consecutive triplet. \n                        The consecutive triplets that include 1: [1,2,3] (missing 2 and 3) -> two missing.\n                        The consecutive triplets that include 4: [2,3,4] (missing 2 and 3) -> two missing, or [4,5,6] (missing 5 and 6) -> two missing.\n\n                    So we cannot form a shuntsu with one draw. But we can form a koutsu with one draw. So answer is 1.\n\n            Example: [1,4,7] (same suit): \n                0: no.\n                1: \n                    koutsu: no duplicate -> cannot form koutsu in one draw (we would need to draw two of one kind, but that's two draws).\n                    shuntsu: we have {1,4,7}. \n                        Check consecutive triplets: \n                            [1,2,3]: missing 2,3 -> two missing.\n                            [2,3,4]: missing 2,3 -> two missing (but we have 4, so we are missing 2,3) -> not.\n                            [3,4,5]: missing 3,5 -> two missing.\n                            [4,5,6]: missing 5,6 -> two missing.\n                            [5,6,7]: missing 5,6 -> two missing.\n                            [6,7,8]: missing 6,8 -> two missing.\n                            [7,8,9]: missing 8,9 -> two missing.\n\n                    So one-draw shuntsu: no.\n\n                2: \n                    koutsu: we can draw two of 1, or two of 4, or two of 7 -> then we have a koutsu. So 2 draws.\n\n                    shuntsu: we can draw two tiles to complete a consecutive triplet. For example, to form [1,2,3]: we can draw 2 and 3. Then we have [1,2,3,4,7]. Then we can use [1,2,3]. So two draws.\n\n                    But wait, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles in a different way? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that are adjacent to an existing tile. \n\n                    However, the minimal is 2.\n\n            Example: [1,2,4] (same suit): \n                0: no.\n                1: \n                    koutsu: no duplicates -> no.\n                    shuntsu: we have {1,2,4}. \n                        Check consecutive triplets:\n                            [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> one draw.\n                            [2,3,4]: we have 2 and 4, missing 3 -> one draw.\n\n                    So one-draw.\n\n            Example: [1,3,4] (same suit): \n                0: no.\n                1: \n                    koutsu: no duplicates -> no.\n                    shuntsu: \n                        [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> one draw.\n                        [2,3,4]: we have 3 and 4, missing 2 -> one draw.\n\n            Example: [1,1,3] (same suit): \n                0: no koutsu (only two 1s) and no shuntsu (set {1,3} not consecutive).\n                1: \n                    koutsu: two 1s -> draw one 1 -> koutsu -> 1 draw.\n                    shuntsu: \n                        [0,1,2]: invalid (0 not allowed)\n                        [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> one draw.\n\n                    So we have two options: 1 draw.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal for same-suit is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n            But note: is it possible that we need 3 draws? \n\n            Example: [1,1,1] -> 0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] -> 1.\n\n            Example: [1,1,4] -> 1.\n\n            Example: [1,2,4] -> 1.\n\n            Example: [1,4,7] -> 2.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1] -> 0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> 0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2] -> \n                0: no koutsu (two 2s, but not three) and no shuntsu (set {1,2} not consecutive)\n                1: \n                    koutsu: two 2s -> draw one 2 -> koutsu -> 1 draw.\n                    shuntsu: \n                        [0,1,2]: invalid\n                        [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> 1 draw.\n\n            So the answer is 1.\n\n            Now, what about different suits?\n\n            Case 2: Tiles are not all same suit.\n\n            Then we cannot form a shuntsu (because shuntsu requires same suit). \n\n            So the only way to form a mentsu is by forming a koutsu.\n\n            But note: a koutsu requires three identical tiles (same number and same suit). \n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','1s'] -> no, because the two 1m are one suit, but the 1s is another. So we cannot form a triplet of three 1m (we only have two 1m) and we cannot form a triplet of three 1s (we only have one 1s). \n\n            However, we can draw tiles arbitrarily.\n\n            Steps for different suits:\n\n            We have three tiles. They might be:\n\n              Option 1: Already have a koutsu? Then 0.\n\n              Option 2: Can we form a koutsu by drawing one tile? \n\n                    For a koutsu, we need three identical tiles (same number and same suit). \n\n                    We can consider each distinct tile (by both number and suit) and count its frequency.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','1m','2p'] -> \n                        Tile '1m': count=2 -> then we can draw one more '1m' to get three.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','2m','3p'] -> \n                        Each tile is distinct. Then we can form a koutsu by drawing two tiles of one kind.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> \n                        We have one of each. Then we can draw two more of one suit? But note: we need three identical. So we can draw two '1m' to get three 1m, but then we have to ignore the other two? Actually, we can choose which three to use. \n\n                    However, we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can draw two '1m' and then we have five tiles: ['1m','1m','1m','1p','1s'] -> then we can form a koutsu of 1m.\n\n                    But wait, we are allowed to use the drawn tiles arbitrarily. We don't have to keep the original ones? Actually, we keep the original three and add the drawn ones. Then we have a set of five tiles. Then we can form a koutsu from the three 1m.\n\n                    However, the problem says: the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu.\n\n                    So we don't need to use all the tiles.\n\n                    Therefore, for koutsu:\n\n                      We can form a koutsu if we can get three copies of any tile (any specific tile: i.e., same number and same suit).\n\n                    How many draws are needed for a particular tile type?\n\n                      Let the tile type (number and suit) be T. \n                      Let count_T = current count of T.\n\n                      Then, we need to draw (3 - count_T) if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The solution involves checking if the current hand already contains a mentsu (0 draws needed). If not, determine if drawing 1 or 2 tiles can form a mentsu.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Same Suit**: Tiles must be of the same suit to form a shuntsu. For koutsu, any three identical tiles (same number and suit) suffice.\n   - **Different Suits**: Only koutsu is possible since shuntsu requires the same suit. Here, we need to form three identical tiles by drawing additional copies.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the hand already has a koutsu or shuntsu.\n   - **One Draw Check**: Determine if drawing one tile can form a koutsu (two existing tiles of the same type) or a shuntsu (two distinct numbers from a consecutive triplet).\n   - **Two Draws Check**: If one draw isn't sufficient, check if two draws can form a koutsu (drawing two copies of a tile) or a shuntsu (completing a consecutive triplet).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves checking all possible consecutive triplets (up to 9 possible starting points) and counting tile frequencies, resulting in a constant time complexity O(1) due to fixed input size (three tiles).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) < 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = data[:3]\n    \n    # Check if already have a mentsu\n    def has_koutsu(tiles):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        count = defaultdict(int)\n        for tile in tiles:\n            count[tile] += 1\n        for v in count.values():\n            if v >= 3:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_shuntsu(tiles):\n        suits = {}\n        for tile in tiles:\n            num = int(tile[0])\n            s = tile[1]\n            if s not in suits:\n                suits[s] = {}\n            if num in suits[s]:\n                suits[s][num] += 1\n            else:\n                suits[s][num] = 1\n                \n        for s, nums in suits.items():\n            nums_set = set(nums.keys())\n            nums_list = sorted(nums_set)\n            n = len(nums_list)\n            for i in range(n - 2):\n                if nums_list[i+1] == nums_list[i] + 1 and nums_list[i+2] == nums_list[i] + 2:\n                    return True\n            for num in nums_list:\n                for neighbor in [num-1, num+1]:\n                    if neighbor not in nums:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n        return False\n\n    if has_koutsu(tiles) or has_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one-draw possibility\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    tile_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        tile_count[tile] += 1\n        \n    one_draw = False\n    \n    # Check koutsu with one draw\n    for tile in tile_count:\n        if tile_count[tile] >= 2:\n            one_draw = True\n            break\n            \n    # Check shuntsu with one draw\n    if not one_draw:\n        suits = {}\n        for tile in tiles:\n            num = int(tile[0])\n            s = tile[1]\n            if s not in suits:\n                suits[s] = {}\n            if num in suits[s]:\n                suits[s][num] += 1\n            else:\n                suits[s][num] = 1\n                \n        for s, nums in suits.items():\n            nums_set = set(nums.keys())\n            nums_list = sorted(nums_set)\n            for x in range(1, 8):\n                if x in nums_set and x+1 in nums_set and x+2 in nums_set:\n                    one_draw = True\n                    break\n            if one_draw:\n                break\n                \n    if one_draw:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Two draws needed\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three strings representing tiles. Each string is split into individual tiles.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the hand already contains a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). If found, it prints `0`.\n3. **One Draw Check**: \n   - **Koutsu**: If there are at least two tiles of the same type, drawing one more forms a koutsu.\n   - **Shuntsu**: If the tiles include two numbers from any valid consecutive triplet (e.g., 1,2,3), drawing the missing number completes a shuntsu.\n4. **Two Draws Check**: If no one-draw solution exists, the answer is `2`, as drawing two tiles (either two copies of a tile for koutsu or completing a sequence) will suffice.\n5. **Output**: The minimum number of draws (0, 1, or 2) is printed based on the checks above.",
