Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any extra whitespace including newline) to get the expected letters.\n - The third line is the pile.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Expected: \n        Combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But note: the example input has the third line as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which when sorted should be the same as the sorted combined.\n\n However, wait: the example input in the problem is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n But we are reading from stdin, so we will read three lines.\n\n Let me clarify with the example:\n\n   Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n Now, if we combine Line1 and Line2, we get \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". The length is 14 + 8 = 22.\n\n The pile \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 14 + 8 = 22? Let's count:\n\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n   S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 19? \n\n Wait, let me count: \n   SANTA -> 5, MOROZ -> 5, then DEDCLaus -> 7? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n   Input example: \n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But that example is just one element in a list? Actually, the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So, we can assume:\n\n        guest_name = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host_name = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, combining guest_name and host_name: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> this is 14+8=22 characters.\n\n   The pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 19 characters.\n\n   But wait, the example says \"In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\"\n\n   This implies that the pile must have exactly the same letters as the combined string.\n\n   However, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   Let me check: \n\n        Combined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> \n        S: appears in both? Let me break down:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Total: \n          S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        Break down: \n          S: 2 (at the beginning and at the end) -> but wait, let's write it out:\n\n          S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n          Count:\n            S: 2\n            A: 2\n            N: 1\n            T: 1\n            M: 1\n            O: 2\n            R: 1\n            Z: 1\n            D: 2\n            E: 1\n            C: 1\n            L: 1\n            U: 1\n\n        But wait, the combined string only has 1 S. However, the pile has 2 S's.\n\n        There's a discrepancy.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example: \n\n        The example input is given as: \n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        But note: the example output is \"YES\".\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended to use the entire string from the first two lines without breaking the words? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n\n            \"the last line contains letters in a pile\"\n\n        and the example input is provided as:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        That means the first two lines are separate: the first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", the second is \"DEDMOROZ\", and the third is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n        But then the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n        Now, if we sort the combined string and the pile:\n\n        Combined: \n            'A','A','A','C','D','D','E','L','M','N','O','O','R','S','T','U','Z' -> wait, let me list:\n\n            SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ: \n            S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z\n\n            Actually, counting again for the combined string:\n\n            S: appears twice? (one in SANTA and one in the second S in SANTACLAUS? No, SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> so two S's? \n            Let me spell: \n                SANTACLAUS: \n                S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> indeed two S's.\n\n            Then the combined string: \n                Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters: two S's, three A's, etc.\n                Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters: two D's, two O's, etc.\n\n            Combined: two S's from guest, plus one S from host? No, host doesn't have an S.\n\n            So total S: 2 (from guest) and the rest as above.\n\n        Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> \n            Let's count S: two (first and last), A: three (positions 2,5,17), D: two, O: two, etc.\n\n        Now, the combined string (guest+host) has:\n            S: 2 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 2\n            A: 3 (guest: SANTA has 2 A's? Actually: \n                SANTA: S, A, N, T, A -> two A's; CLAUS: C, L, A, U, S -> one A -> total 3)\n            And the pile has A:3, S:2, etc.\n\n        So now they match.\n\n        Therefore, the example is correct.\n\n        The issue was: I miscounted the guest's name. \"SANTACLAUS\" has two S's and three A's.\n\n        So the method is to:\n\n          s1 = first_line.strip()\n          s2 = second_line.strip()\n          s3 = third_line.strip()\n\n          if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        But note: the example input might have newlines, so stripping is good.\n\n        However, the problem says the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 2: \n            Input: \n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n            Expected: NO\n\n        Combined string: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let's count the letters:\n\n        Combined: \n            P: 2 (from PAPA) and then the rest?\n            A: 3 (PAPA:2, NOEL:1)\n            P: 2\n            A: 3\n            I: 1 (from NOEL)\n            N: 1\n            O: 1 (from NOEL) + 1 (from PAPAINOEL) -> wait, let's break:\n\n            PAPAINOEL: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L\n            JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n            Combined: \n                P: 2 (from PAPA) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI) = 3\n                A: 2 (from PAPA) + 0 = 2\n                I: 1 (from PAPAINOEL) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI) = 2\n                N: 1\n                O: 1 (from PAPAINOEL) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI) = 2\n                E: 1\n                L: 1 (from PAPAINOEL) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI) = 2\n                J: 1\n                U: 3 (from JOULUPUKKI: U appears three times? JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> yes, three U's)\n                K: 2\n\n            Now, the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            Let me break it down (without spaces):\n\n            J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n            Counting:\n                J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            Now compare:\n\n            Combined: \n                P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n            Pile:\n                P:2 -> missing one P.\n\n            So indeed, the pile has 2 P's but we need 3.\n\n            Therefore, the sorted lists would not be equal.\n\n        Example 3: \n            Input: \n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Expected: NO\n\n            Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n            Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me check length: \n                Combined: len(\"BABBONATALE\") + len(\"FATHERCHRISTMAS\") = 10 + 14 = 24\n                Pile: len(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") = 25 -> already different length.\n\n            So we can immediately say NO.\n\n        However, we don't know the lengths until we check. But if the lengths are different, we can avoid sorting.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if len(s1+s2) != len(s3):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        This is efficient because the maximum length is 200 (each up to 100). Sorting 200 elements is cheap.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the combined length is at most 200.\n\n        We'll read the three lines.\n\n        Example 1: \n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            len(s1+s2) = 22, len(s3)=22 -> then sort and compare.\n\n        Example 2: \n            s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            len(s1+s2)=21, len(s3)=19 -> wait, no: \n            \"PAPAINOEL\" has 9 letters, \"JOULUPUKKI\" has 10, so 19. \n            But wait, the example input for the third line is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which has 19 letters.\n\n            However, the example says the output is NO because of a missing letter and an extra.\n\n            But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n                ['PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI']\n\n            So the third line is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which is 19 characters.\n\n            The combined is 9+10=19. Then why NO?\n\n            Because the letters don't match. The example says: \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n            Actually, wait: the example says \"In the second sample letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n            But the combined string has 3 P's (from the breakdown above) and the pile has 2 P's. Also, the combined string has 2 L's (from guest: BABBONATALE has one L? Actually, let me recalc for example2:\n\n            Example2:\n\n                Guest: PAPAINOEL -> P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L -> 1 L.\n                Host: JOULUPUKKI -> J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 1 L.\n\n                So combined: 2 L's.\n\n                Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> \n                    J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 3 L's.\n\n            So the pile has 3 L's, but we need 2.\n\n            Therefore, the sorted lists will be different.\n\n        So the method is:\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                # Sort both the combined string and the pile string and compare\n                if sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let me run the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n            s1+s2 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", sorted(s1+s2) = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n            s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", sorted(s3) = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n            They should be the same.\n\n        Example 2: \n            s1+s2 = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\", sorted(s1+s2) -> a list of 19 letters\n            s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", sorted(s3) -> a list of 19 letters, but different.\n\n        Example 3: \n            s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            len(s1)=10, len(s2)=14, so total 24, but s3 has 25 -> NO.\n\n        However, note: the example input in the problem for the third sample is:\n\n            ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n            The third string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", which has 25 letters.\n\n        Therefore, our code should work.\n\n        But note: the example input representation in the problem is a list of strings, but we are reading three lines.\n\n        We are using:\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n        This is standard.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more thing: performance. The maximum length is 200, so sorting 200 elements is very fast.\n\n        Code:\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, we can also consider using collections.Counter for counting the letters, which might be slightly faster for long strings, but here the strings are short.\n\n        But note: the problem says the length is at most 100 for each, so the combined is 200, and the pile is 200.\n\n        Using Counter:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But we still have to check the length, because if the lengths are different, the counters will be different too. However, the Counter method will implicitly check the counts and the keys.\n\n        However, the problem says the pile might have extra or missing letters, so the length check is necessary for efficiency (if the lengths differ, we don't need to count all the letters).\n\n        But note: if the lengths are the same, but the counts are different, then the Counter will catch it. However, the Counter method might be slower than the sorted method for the same length? \n\n        Actually, the sorted method creates two lists of 200 elements and sorts them. The Counter method creates three Counters (for s1+s2, and s3) and then compares the counts. \n\n        The sorted method is O(n log n) for two lists of size 200, which is 200*log2(200) ~ 200*8 = 1600 operations per sort, so two sorts: 3200.\n\n        The Counter method: for a string of 200, it goes through each character and counts, then compares two dictionaries. The counting for two strings of 200: 400 operations, and then comparing the two Counters (dictionaries) is O(n) in the number of distinct letters.\n\n        Since the alphabet is only 26, the comparison is very fast.\n\n        But the problem is small, so either way is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says the letters are uppercase Latin letters, so we can also use a fixed array of 26.\n\n        But for clarity and since the problem is small, we can use the sorted method.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the Counter method and skip the length check because if the length is different, the Counter will not be equal.\n\n        But the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the same multiset.\n\n        So:\n\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        This is simpler and handles the length automatically (because if the total length is different, the counts for some letter would differ by the difference).\n\n        However, the Counter method might be considered less efficient in terms of memory and time for very long strings, but here the maximum length is 200, so it's negligible.\n\n        But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the combined string is at most 200, and the pile is at most 200.\n\n        However, the problem says the pile is the third line, and the length of the pile is the same as the sum of the first two? Not necessarily, but if the pile is longer, then the Counter method will still work.\n\n        Actually, the Counter method does not require the same length because if the length is different, the counts for some letters will differ, and the Counter objects will be different.\n\n        So we can simply do:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait, what if the pile is shorter? Then the Counter(s3) will have fewer counts for some letters, and the condition fails.\n\n        So the Counter method inherently checks the exact multiset.\n\n        However, the problem says the pile is found at the door and we need to verify that there are no extra letters and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n\n        The Counter method does exactly that: the multiset of the pile must be exactly the multiset of the two names.\n\n        So this is acceptable.\n\n        But the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and we are to write efficient code.\n\n        The sorted method and the Counter method are both efficient for 200 characters.\n\n        However, the Counter method uses a dictionary which might be slightly slower than sorting for such a small input, but the difference is negligible.\n\n        I'll choose the Counter method because it is more direct and less error-prone.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input contains only uppercase letters. So we don't have to worry about other characters.\n\n        Let me write the code with Counter.\n\n        However, if we are not allowed to use the collections module, we could do:\n\n            def count_letters(s):\n                # returns a dictionary of letter counts for s\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                d = defaultdict(int)\n                for char in s:\n                    d[char] += 1\n                return d\n\n            c1 = count_letters(s1+s2)\n            c2 = count_letters(s3)\n            if c1 == c2:\n                ...\n\n        But the problem does not restrict imports, and using Counter is standard.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            # and then proceed.\n\n        But the problem says to include necessary imports.\n\n        Since the problem is small, we can use Counter.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.\"\n\n        We are only importing Counter.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input is from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n        Final code with Counter:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: YES -> works.\n        Example 2: NO -> works.\n        Example 3: NO -> works.\n\n        But wait, example3: \n            s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            The Counter for s1+s2 and s3: \n                s1+s2: \n                    B:2, A:2, B:2 (already) ... but wait, let me count manually for example3:\n\n            s1 = \"BABBONATALE\": \n                B:2, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, L:1\n            s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\":\n                F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, M:1, A:1, S:1 -> wait, let me break s2: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n                F,A,T,H,E,R,C,H,R,I,S,T,M,A,S -> \n                A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1, F:1\n\n            Combined: \n                B:2, A:2 (from s1) + 2 (from s2) = 4, O:1, N:1, T:2 (1 from s1, 1 from s2), E:1+1=2, R:2, C:1, H:2, I:1, S:2, M:1, F:1, L:1 (from s1)\n\n            Now, the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me break it down:\n\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Without spaces: \n                B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n            Count:\n                B:3, A:5, T:3, H:2, E:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1, O:1, N:1, F:1, L:2\n\n            So clearly, the combined has B:2, but the pile has 3 -> so Counter(combined) != Counter(pile)\n\n            Therefore, output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input is three lines. We are reading three lines.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n            Output: YES\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input:\n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input:\n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        All correct.\n\n        But note: the example input representation in the problem is a list of three strings, but we are reading from stdin. The problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n        So we are reading three lines.\n\n        However, if the input is given via a file, we can use the same code.\n\n        We'll submit the code accordingly.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the input is from stdin, so we use input().\n\n        However, in some online judges, input() may be slower, but for 3 lines and up to 100 characters, it's fine.\n\n        We'll write the code.\n\n        IMPORTANT: In Python, input() reads a line from stdin and returns it as a string.\n\n        We are using .strip() to remove any trailing newline or spaces. But the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, so the newline might be included. Using strip() removes any leading/trailing whitespace, which includes the newline. But the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, so the newline is the only possible trailing whitespace.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use .rstrip() to remove only the trailing newline, but strip() is safe.\n\n        However, the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the entire line (except the newline) is uppercase letters.\n\n        We'll keep the .strip().\n\n        Code:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let me run with the sample inputs.\n\n        Sample 1: \n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n            Output: YES\n\n        Sample 2: \n            Input:\n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        Sample 3: \n            Input:\n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        It works.\n\n        But note: the example input in the problem was provided as a list of strings. Our code reads from stdin, so if we are testing from a file, we can use the same.\n\n        We are ready.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100. Our code handles that.\n\n        We'll submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (count of each letter) of the combined names matches the multiset of the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the standard input, which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Multiset Match**: Use a counter (from the `collections` module) to compare the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of each letter in the pile. If both counts match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for an exact match in letter counts, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present in the pile compared to the combined names.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three strings from standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined string and the pile string (`s3`).\n4. **Comparison**: The counts from the combined names and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, and the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis method ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in tools for handling character counts and comparisons.",
