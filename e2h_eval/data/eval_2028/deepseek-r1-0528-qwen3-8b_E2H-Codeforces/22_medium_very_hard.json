After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means highest mark, and note: marks are from 1 to 9).\n    But note: there can be multiple students having the same highest mark? Then they are all considered best for that subject.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (0-indexed), we can find the maximum mark in that column.\n Then, for each student i, we check if there exists at least one subject j such that:\n   grade[i][j] == max_mark[j]   (because if there are multiple students with the max_mark, then they are all best in that subject)\n\n But note: what if the maximum mark appears only once? Then only that student is best in that subject.\n\n However, the condition for being successful is independent for each student: we just require that the student has the maximum mark in at least one subject.\n\n Implementation:\n Step 1: Parse input.\n Step 2: Create a list of rows (each row is a string of length m)\n Step 3: For each subject j (column), compute the maximum value (as a char) in that column.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n   subjects = list of n marks for subject j, which is [row[j] for row in grid]\n\n Then, for each student i, we look at his marks in each subject and check if for any subject j, his mark equals the maximum mark for subject j.\n\n However, note: the grid is small (n, m <= 100). So we can do:\n\n   max_marks = []\n   for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n Then, for each student i, we check for at least one j such that grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n But wait: what if two students have the same maximum mark? Then both are best in that subject, so both are successful because of that subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        2 2\n        12\n        21\n\n   For subject0: max_marks[0] = '2'\n   For subject1: max_marks[1] = '2'\n\n   Student0: ['1','2'] -> in subject0: 1 != 2 -> not best; subject1: 2==2 -> best -> successful.\n   Student1: ['2','1'] -> subject0: 2==2 -> best -> successful.\n\n Therefore, we can count the student if there is at least one subject j for which grid[i][j] == max_marks[j].\n\n However, note: the example input format is given as a string. The sample input might be provided as:\n\n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   But the problem says: the first line contains two integers, then n lines.\n\n   Let me read from stdin.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Expected output: 2\n\n   Let's break down:\n        Student0: \"223\" -> [2,2,3]\n        Student1: \"232\" -> [2,3,2]\n        Student2: \"112\" -> [1,1,2]\n\n   For subject0: max_marks[0] = max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n   For subject1: max_marks[1] = max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n   For subject2: max_marks[2] = max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n   Now check:\n        Student0: \n            subject0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n            (subject1: '2' != '3'; subject2: '3' == '3' -> also True, but one is enough)\n        Student1:\n            subject0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n            subject1: '3' == '3' -> True -> successful (but one is enough)\n        Student2:\n            subject0: '1' != '2'\n            subject1: '1' != '3'\n            subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So the count is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   Output: 3\n\n   We'll compute max_marks for each subject (each column) for 5 subjects.\n\n   Column0: ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n   Column1: ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n   Column2: ['7','8','1'] -> max='8'\n   Column3: ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n   Column4: ['8','8','1'] -> max='8'\n\n   Now check each student:\n\n   Student0: \"91728\"\n        subject0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n   Student1: \"11828\"\n        subject1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n   Student2: \"11111\"\n        subject1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n   So all three are successful.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read n, m\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        grid.append(s)\n\n   max_marks = [0]*m   # We will make a list of m elements, each element is the max for that subject.\n\n   Actually, we can use:\n        max_marks[j] = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n   Then, for each student i, we check:\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count this student and break inner loop.\n\n   Then output the count.\n\n But note: the input may be provided as a single string in the example, but the problem reads from stdin.\n\n However, the problem says: the first input line contains two integers. Then next n lines.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Edge: n=1, m=1: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n        Then max_marks[0] = '5'\n        Check student0: grid[0][0]=='5' -> True -> successful, so output 1.\n\n Another edge: all same marks, e.g., \n        Input: \n            2 2\n            11\n            11\n\n        Then max_marks = ['1','1']\n        Student0: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n        Student1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n This matches the requirement: each student is the best at every subject, so they are successful.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column of the gradebook to identify the maximum value.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If a student has the highest mark in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark in that subject.\n3. **Student Success Check**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Result Output**: The total count of successful students is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to handle the constraints effectively.",
