And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait: the example says \"then the result is\" and then they don't explicitly say what 9 is?\n Let me recalc: \n   First week: (3+4) = 7, second week: (4+7)=11. Then the total sleep over all weeks is 7+11=18.\n   There are 2 weeks, so average per week is 18/2 = 9.\n\n So the problem: we are to compute the average of the averages for each week? Actually, note that the example does not say \"average over all days\", but \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\".\n\n However, note: the doctor asked for the average amount of hours of sleep per week. And we have multiple weeks. So we are to take the average of the weekly averages.\n\n But note: there's an alternative interpretation. We could also think: total sleep over the entire period (which is n days) divided by the number of weeks? \n\n However, note: the example has two weeks, and the two weeks together cover 3 days (since the last week ends at day 3, but the first week is days 1 and 2, the second week is days 2 and 3). So if we simply take total sleep (which is 3+4+7=14) and divide by 2 (weeks) we get 7, which is not 9.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: the average per week is defined as (sum of sleep in that week) / k, and then we average these values over the (n-k+1) weeks.\n\n So we need to compute:\n   total_weekly_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [ (a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[i+k-1]) / k ]\n\n But note: the average over the weeks is the same as (total_weekly_sum) / (n-k+1)\n\n And total_weekly_sum = (sum of all windows of size k) / k.\n\n Then: average = (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [ (window_sum_i) ]) / (n-k+1) = (1/k * (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} window_sum_i)) / (n-k+1) = (1/(k*(n-k+1))) * (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} window_sum_i)\n\n But note: we can also compute the total sleep in all windows without dividing by k until the end.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the overall average by:\n\n   average = (sum of all elements, but each element is counted as many times as it appears in a window) / (k*(n-k+1))\n\n But wait, how many times is each element counted?\n\n For an element at position i (0-indexed), it will appear in a window starting from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). The count for element i is (min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1) ?\n\n Actually, the windows that include element i are those that start from j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1 (so that the window [j, j+k-1] includes i). Also, j must be at least 0 and at most n-k.\n\n So the starting index j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= max(0, i-k+1) and j <= i and j <= n-k.\n\n The condition j<=i is redundant because j<=n-k and we require j>=max(0,i-k+1). The valid j's are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). Therefore, the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n However, note: if we let L = max(0, i-k+1) and R = min(i, n-k), then the count is R - L + 1.\n\n But note: the window must have length k and we require that i is in the window. The window starting at j must be <= i and >= i-k+1, and j must be in [0, n-k].\n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum of all window sums.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1: Use a sliding window to compute the sum of the window for each week, then average the weekly averages.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints (n up to 200,000) and k can be any value from 1 to n. We can compute the sum of all window sums by:\n\n   total_window_sum = 0\n   # Precompute prefix sums for the array\n   prefix[0] = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   Then the sum of window starting at i (from 0 to n-k) is: prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n   Then total_window_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n But note: this is the same as (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n And we can also compute this without storing all prefix sums by noting that:\n\n   total_window_sum = (prefix[n] * something) ... actually, we can use the fact that:\n\n   Each element a[i] appears in the windows that start from max(0, i-k+1) to i (if we consider the window must include i and the window starts at j, then j <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j<=n-k). But note: the window starting at j must end at j+k-1, so i must be <= j+k-1 -> j>= i-k+1.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the formula above with the prefix sums.\n\n Then the average is (total_window_sum / (k * (n-k+1))) ? \n\n Actually, no: because the total_window_sum is the sum of the window sums (each window sum is the sum of k numbers). Then the average per week is (each window sum) / k, and then we average over (n-k+1) weeks:\n\n   average = (total_window_sum / (k * (n-k+1)))\n\n But wait: total_window_sum is the sum of the window sums. Then the average over the weeks is (total_window_sum) divided by (k * (n-k+1))? \n\n Let me break down:\n\n   Let S = total_window_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (window_i)\n   Then the average per week is (window_i) / k, so the average over the weeks is (1/(n-k+1)) * (1/k) * S.\n\n   So yes: average = S / (k*(n-k+1))\n\n However, note: we can also compute S by the prefix sum method.\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n   prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=3, prefix[2]=7, prefix[3]=10.\n\n   Window0 (start0): prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n   Window1 (start1): prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 10-3 = 7\n\n   Then S = 7+7 = 14.\n\n   Then average = 14 / (2*2) = 14/4 = 3.5.\n\n But the expected answer is 9.\n\n Wait, let me check the example again: \n\n   The example says: \"then the result is\" and then the output is 9.0000000000.\n\n What's going on?\n\n Let me re-read the problem statement: \n   \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n In the example, there are two weeks. The average per week is the average of the two weekly averages? \n\n But note: the example output is 9.0, which is (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2? No, wait: \n\n   First week: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n   Second week: (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n\n Then the average of the two weekly averages is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5, which is not 9.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the total sleep over all the days, and then divide by the total days? \n\n   Total sleep: 3+4+7 = 14, and the total days covered by the two weeks is 3 (because the two weeks together cover 3 days: day1, day2, day3). But note: the two weeks share day2.\n\n   If we think of the average per week, then we have two weeks. The total sleep for the two weeks is 3+4 (for the first) and 4+7 (for the second) -> total sleep across both weeks is 3+4+4+7 = 18. Then average per week is 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n So the problem is: the average of the weekly totals (without dividing by k) and then divide by the number of weeks? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". \n\n   Per week: the first week is 7 hours (over 2 days) and the second week is 11 hours (over 2 days). Then the average per week is (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n So the problem is: we are to compute the average of the weekly totals (the raw sum for each week) and then that average is the answer.\n\n But note: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n So the procedure is:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the sum for each week (each contiguous segment of length k).\n   Step 2: Average these sums (i.e., divide the total sum of the week-sums by the number of weeks).\n\n   Number of weeks = n - k + 1.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n      total_weekly_sum = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_weekly_sum += sum(a[i:i+k])\n\n      average = total_weekly_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n However, the direct summation of each window would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n, k up to 200,000.\n\n Instead, we can use prefix sums:\n\n      Let P[0] = 0, and P[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n      Then the sum of the window starting at i is P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n      Then total_weekly_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n      Then average = total_weekly_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n      P[0]=0, P[1]=3, P[2]=3+4=7, P[3]=3+4+7=10\n\n      i=0: P[2]-P[0] = 7-0 = 7\n      i=1: P[3]-P[1] = 10-3 = 7\n\n      total_weekly_sum = 7+7 = 14\n      number of weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n      average = 14/2 = 7 -> but expected is 9.\n\n Wait, now I'm confused.\n\n Let me recalc the example: the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The weekly totals are 7 and 11, respectively. Then the average should be (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n But our prefix method gave 7+7 = 14, which is 7+7=14, but the actual weekly totals are 7 and 11.\n\n Why did we get 7 for the second window?\n\n      For the second window: i=1, so we take a[1] to a[1+2-1] = a[1] to a[2]: 4 and 7 -> 11, but our prefix: P[3]-P[1] = 10-3 = 7, which is wrong.\n\n The mistake: the prefix array P is defined so that P[i] = sum of the first i elements.\n\n      a0=3, a1=4, a2=7.\n\n      P[0]=0\n      P[1]=a0=3\n      P[2]=a0+a1=3+4=7\n      P[3]=a0+a1+a2=3+4+7=14?  But wait, I initially set P[3]=10, that was a mistake.\n\n Correction: \n      We have a = [3,4,7], so:\n          P[0]=0\n          P[1]=3\n          P[2]=3+4=7\n          P[3]=3+4+7=14\n\n      Then window0: i=0 -> P[0+2] - P[0] = P[2]-P[0]=7-0=7 -> correct.\n      Window1: i=1 -> P[1+2] - P[1] = P[3]-P[1]=14-3=11 -> correct.\n\n      Then total_weekly_sum = 7+11 = 18\n      average = 18/2 = 9.\n\n So the error was in my manual calculation of the prefix array.\n\n Therefore, the plan is:\n\n   Read n,k and the list a.\n\n   Precompute the prefix sum array P of length n+1.\n\n   total_weekly_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_weekly_sum += (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n   average = total_weekly_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n   Print the average with 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the total_weekly_sum might be an integer, but we are dividing by (n-k+1) which may not be an integer.\n\n But the problem requires: absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n We can use floating point division, but note: the numbers can be large (n, k up to 200000, and a[i] up to 10^5). The maximum total_weekly_sum is (n-k+1)* (k * 10^5) which is about 200000 * 200000 * 100000 -> that is 4e15, which is within the range of Python floats, but we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic and then convert to float for division, but since the problem allows absolute or relative error 1e-6, and the numbers are integers, we can do:\n\n   total_weekly_sum is an integer, then we divide by (n-k+1) as a float.\n\n But note: the problem says the input integers, so we can do:\n\n   total_weekly_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_weekly_sum += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   Then average = total_weekly_sum / float(n-k+1)\n\n However, we can also use:\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_weekly_sum / (n-k+1)))\n\n But wait, is that safe? The total_weekly_sum is an integer and n-k+1 is an integer. The division might be non-integer.\n\n Example: n=3, k=2: total_weekly_sum=18, n-k+1=2 -> 18/2=9.0.\n\n Another example: n=4, k=2, a=[1,2,3,4]:\n   Windows: [1,2] -> 3, [2,3] -> 5, [3,4] -> 7 -> total_weekly_sum=3+5+7=15, average=15/3=5.0.\n\n But note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n   total_weekly_sum = P[1]-P[0] = 10 - 0 = 10\n   average = 10/1 = 10.0\n\n And the third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n   n=8, k=2, so 7 weeks.\n\n   We need to compute the sum of the 7 windows of length 2.\n\n   We can do it by hand for the first few and last few:\n\n   Window0: 1+2 = 3\n   Window1: 2+4 = 6\n   Window2: 4+100000 = 100004\n   Window3: 100000+123 = 100123\n   Window4: 123+456 = 579\n   Window5: 456+789 = 1245\n   Window6: 789+1 = 790\n\n   Total_weekly_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n\n   Let me add step by step:\n\n     3+6=9\n     9+100004=100013\n     100013+100123=200136\n     200136+579=200715\n     200715+1245=201960\n     201960+790=202750\n\n   Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   The example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n   So the code:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read first line: n, k\n   Read second line: list of n integers.\n\n   Precompute prefix: \n        prefix[0] = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   total_weekly_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_weekly_sum += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   avg = total_weekly_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n   Format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the above loop runs (n-k+1) times, and n can be up to 200,000. This is acceptable because it's O(n) and n-k+1 can be up to 200,000.\n\n But note: the prefix array is already computed, so we are just doing a single pass for the prefix and then a single pass for the windows.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: we can also use a more efficient way to compute the total_weekly_sum without the explicit loop? \n\n   total_weekly_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   But note: prefix[0] is 0, so:\n\n   = (sum_{i=k}^{n} prefix[i]) - (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} prefix[i])\n\n   However, we don't need to do that because we are already using the prefix array and we are iterating only (n-k+1) times, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: we can compute the sum of the prefix array from k to n and from 0 to n-k, but that doesn't save us much because we still need to iterate over the prefix array.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the loop by:\n\n   total_weekly_sum = 0\n   for i in range(k, n+1):\n        total_weekly_sum += prefix[i]\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_weekly_sum -= prefix[i]\n\n   But then we are iterating two times: one for the first part (k to n) and one for the second part (0 to n-k). \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   total_weekly_sum = 0\n   for i in range(k, n+1):\n        total_weekly_sum += prefix[i]\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_weekly_sum -= prefix[i]\n\n   But wait, the original expression is:\n\n        total_weekly_sum = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   And note: the indices in the first part go from k to n (inclusive) and the second part from 0 to n-k (inclusive). \n\n   However, the first part: the window starting at i uses prefix[i+k] and prefix[i]. The window starts at i from 0 to n-k, so we are subtracting prefix[i] for i from 0 to n-k, and adding prefix[i+k] for i from 0 to n-k, which is the same as adding prefix[k] to prefix[n] (because i from 0 to n-k means i+k from k to n).\n\n   So the above two loops are equivalent.\n\n   But note: the range of i in the second part is from 0 to n-k (inclusive) so we subtract prefix[0] to prefix[n-k]. The first part adds prefix[k] to prefix[n].\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we can compute the two parts without a loop by using the built-in sum and slicing the prefix array, but that would create a new list and use extra memory.\n\n   Since n can be 200000, and the prefix array is already stored, we can do:\n\n        total_weekly_sum = sum(prefix[k:n+1]) - sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])\n\n   But note: prefix has length n+1, so:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:])   # from index k to n (inclusive) because prefix has n+1 elements, the last index is n (since we defined prefix[0..n])\n        part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n        total_weekly_sum = part1 - part2\n\n   However, the second part: prefix[0:n-k+1] is from index0 to index (n-k) (since slicing in Python goes up to but not including the stop index). \n\n   Actually, we want prefix[0] to prefix[n-k] (inclusive). The slice [0:n-k+1] gives indices 0 to n-k (because it stops at n-k+1, exclusive). So that is correct.\n\n   But the first part: prefix[k:n+1] gives from index k to n (inclusive) because n+1 is exclusive? Actually, no: the slice [k:n+1] goes from k to n (inclusive) because the last index is n (inclusive) when we use n+1 as the stop.\n\n   However, note: our prefix array has n+1 elements: indices 0 to n.\n\n   So:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:n+1])   -> indices k to n (inclusive) -> (n - k + 1) elements.\n        part2 = sum(prefix[0:n-k+1]) -> indices 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> (n-k+1) elements.\n\n   Then total_weekly_sum = part1 - part2.\n\n   But wait, the original expression is:\n\n        total_weekly_sum = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   So that matches.\n\n   However, the two parts are computed separately and we are using two slices and two sum operations. The total_weekly_sum might be very large, but we are only doing two slices and two sums. The time complexity is O(n) and the memory is O(n) for the prefix array.\n\n   But note: the problem says n up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_weekly_sum = sum(prefix[k:n+1]) - sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n   But wait: the two slices together are of length (n+1) and we are summing each once. But note: the two slices might be large, but we are just doing two passes.\n\n   However, the original method with the for-loop runs (n-k+1) times and each time we do two array lookups (each O(1) because we precomputed the prefix array). \n\n   Which is better? The slicing method uses two slices and two sum() calls, which internally also iterates over the slices. \n\n   The for-loop method:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   This is one loop, and we do two lookups per iteration (each O(1)). The total operations are (n-k+1)*2, which is about 400000 operations.\n\n   The slicing method:\n\n        part1 = 0\n        for j in range(k, n+1):   # n-k+1 elements\n            part1 += prefix[j]\n\n        part2 = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1): # n-k+1 elements\n            part2 += prefix[j]\n\n        total_weekly_sum = part1 - part2\n\n   This is two loops, each of (n-k+1) iterations, so same total operations.\n\n   The difference is that the for-loop method does the subtraction in one go, while the slicing method does two separate sums.\n\n   The for-loop method is probably more efficient because we avoid creating two large slices (which creates two temporary lists? Actually, no: the slicing in Python creates a view for some immutable types but for list it creates a new list? Actually, no: in CPython, for lists, slicing creates a new list. So we are creating two new lists of size (n-k+1) and (n-k+1) respectively, and then summing them. This uses extra memory and time.\n\n   The for-loop method uses O(1) extra memory (apart from the prefix array) and does the computation in one go.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and (n-k+1) can be up to 200000, so the two slices would be two arrays of 200000 integers. Each integer is up to 10^5 * 200000 (wait, no: the prefix array elements can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 = 20e9, which fits in an integer but the memory for two slices of 200000 integers is 200000*8*2 bytes? 3.2 MB, which is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem says we are reading from stdin and writing to stdout, and we are not told about memory limits, but typically competitive programming problems have memory limits around 256MB or so, so 3.2 MB is nothing.\n\n   However, let's stick to the clarity and efficiency. The for-loop method is straightforward and avoids the memory overhead of the slices.\n\n   But note: the problem says to write a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. We must be efficient and clear.\n\n   Let me choose the for-loop method.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        total_weekly_sum = 0\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        # Iterate over the starting index i from 0 to num_weeks-1\n        for i in range(num_weeks):\n            # Each window starting at i: from i to i+k-1\n            # The sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n            total_weekly_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        average = total_weekly_sum / num_weeks\n\n        # Format the average to have 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But wait, the example input \"1 1\\n10\": \n        n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n        prefix = [0,10]\n        num_weeks = 1\n        i=0: total_weekly_sum = prefix[1]-prefix[0] = 10-0=10\n        average = 10/1 = 10.0 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        prefix = [0,3,7,14]\n        num_weeks=2\n        i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0]=7-0=7\n        i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=14-3=11\n        total_weekly_sum=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> correct.\n\n   The third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        n=8, k=2, num_weeks=7\n        We computed the windows: [1,2] -> 3, [2,4] -> 6, [4,100000] -> 100004, [100000,123] -> 100123, [123,456] -> 579, [456,789] -> 1245, [789,1] -> 790.\n        total_weekly_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750\n        average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   But wait, let me check the addition:\n\n        3 + 6 = 9\n        9 + 100004 = 100013\n        100013 + 100123 = 200136\n        200136 + 579 = 200715\n        200715 + 1245 = 201960\n        201960 + 790 = 202750 -> correct.\n\n   Now, we must format the output to 10 decimal places.\n\n   Let me run the code for the third example and see the output.\n\n   However, note: the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n   But when we do 202750 / 7, we get:\n\n        202750 // 7 = 28964 remainder 2 -> so 28964 + 2/7\n\n        2/7 = 0.2857142857... (repeating every 6 digits: 285714)\n\n   So the output should be 28964.2857142857...\n\n   How does formatting work?\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(28964.2857142857))\n\n   This will give: 28964.2857142857\n\n   But note: the formatting rounds to 10 decimal places. Since 2/7 is a repeating decimal, but we are using floating point, we might get rounding errors.\n\n   However, the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Our calculation is exact in integer arithmetic until the division by 7, and then we rely on floating point. But note: the total_weekly_sum is an integer and we are dividing by an integer (num_weeks). The result is a rational number. Floating point might not represent it exactly, but for the required precision (10 decimal places and error 1e-6) it should be acceptable.\n\n   But note: the numbers can be very large (up to 4e15 as discussed) and then dividing by an integer (up to 200000) might lose precision in floating point? \n\n   The maximum total_weekly_sum is (n-k+1)* (max window sum). The maximum window sum is k * 10^5. So maximum total_weekly_sum is 200000 * (200000 * 100000) = 4e15, which is within the range of integers, but when converting to float, 4e15 is represented exactly? \n\n   However, we are doing:\n\n        average = total_weekly_sum / num_weeks\n\n   and total_weekly_sum and num_weeks are integers. But if total_weekly_sum is 4e15 and num_weeks is 1, then the float representation of 4e15 is exact. But if we divide by 2, 3, etc., the result might not be exact.\n\n   But note: the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. The floating point division of two integers (each up to 4e15) will have an error that is less than 1e-15 relative? Actually, the IEEE double precision has about 15-16 significant decimal digits. \n\n   However, we are only required to output 10 decimal places. So even if there is a tiny error, it should be within 1e-10, which is more than 1e-6.\n\n   Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   But note: the example \"8 2 ...\" has a result that is periodic and we are printing 10 decimal places. The example output is '28964.2857142857'. \n\n   When we do:\n\n        x = 202750 / 7\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(x))\n\n   Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n   However, the example output is exactly that.\n\n   But wait, the example output is written as: '28964.2857142857'\n\n   The formatting in Python will round to 10 decimal places. Let's see:\n\n        >>> x = 28964.2857142857142857   # but actually we don't know the exact representation\n        >>> \"{:.10f}\".format(x)\n        '28964.2857142857'\n\n   But note: the formatting rounds to the nearest representation. The value we have is stored as a float. The exact value of 202750/7 is 28964 + 2/7, and 2/7 is periodic. However, the float cannot store all the digits, but the rounding to 10 decimal places should be correct.\n\n   We'll trust the formatting.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        num_weeks = n - k",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible consecutive weeks in his sleep records. Each week is defined as a sequence of `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in total. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then averaging these sums across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time per week, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to compute this efficiently given the constraints (n up to 200,000), avoiding a brute-force approach that would be too slow.\n2. **Intuition**: By using a prefix sum array, we can quickly compute the sum of any subarray (week) in constant time. The prefix sum array allows us to precompute cumulative sums, making the calculation of each week's sum efficient.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in O(1) time.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each starting index of a week, use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the next `k` elements. Sum these values for all possible weeks.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for constructing the prefix sum array and O(n) for processing each week, resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the storage required for the prefix sum array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_weekly_sum = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(num_weeks):\n        window_sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        total_weekly_sum += window_sum\n        \n    average = total_weekly_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of each week `k`, and the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array is built such that each entry at index `i` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows efficient range sum queries.\n3. **Calculating Weekly Sums**: For each possible starting index of a week (from 0 to `n - k`), the sum of the next `k` days is computed using the prefix sum array. These sums are accumulated into a total.\n4. **Computing Average**: The total sum of all weekly sleeps is divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the prefix sum array to minimize computation time, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
