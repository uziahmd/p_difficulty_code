A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime and the drink and salt are shared.\n\n However, note the requirement: each friend needs nl milliliters, one slice and np grams for one toast.\n\n So for T toasts per friend, the entire group (n friends) will need:\n   - Drink: n * T * nl\n   - Lime slices: n * T\n   - Salt: n * T * np\n\n But wait: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   total_drink = k * l\n   total_lime_slices = c * d\n   total_salt = p\n\n Then, the maximum number of toasts that can be made from drink is: total_drink // (nl * n)   [because each toast for the whole group requires n * nl milliliters?]\n\n Actually, let's reexamine: In the example, there are 3 friends. They want to make as many toasts as they can so that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n For one toast per friend, the entire group uses:\n   drink: 3 * nl\n   lime slices: 3\n   salt: 3 * np\n\n Therefore, the limiting factors are:\n\n   from_drink = total_drink // (nl * n)   [but wait, if we make T toasts per friend, then total toasts is T*n, and the drink needed is T * n * nl? Actually, no: because the condition is per friend: each toast for a friend requires nl milliliters. So for T toasts, one friend uses T * nl. Then for n friends, total drink is n * T * nl.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if we make T toasts for each friend, then each friend uses T * nl, and the entire group uses n * T * nl.\n\n Similarly, for lime: each toast for a friend requires one slice. So for T toasts per friend, each friend uses T slices, and the entire group uses n * T slices.\n\n For salt: each toast for a friend requires np grams, so entire group uses n * T * np.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire group to share the resources arbitrarily. We have to use the same T for every friend.\n\n Therefore, the constraints are:\n\n   n * T * nl <= k * l\n   n * T <= c * d\n   n * T * np <= p\n\n Then, T (toasts per friend) must satisfy:\n\n   T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   T <= (c * d) / n\n   T <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, wait: the example calculation:\n\n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n   Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   total_drink = 4*5 = 20\n   total_lime_slices = 10*8 = 80\n   total_salt = 100\n\n   Now, the drink constraint: T <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so T <= 2 (if using integer division, we take floor)\n\n   But the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   Why 6? Because the example breaks down the drink by considering one toast for the entire group: \n        drink per toast (for the entire group) would be 3 * 3 = 9 ml, so 20/9 -> 2 toasts per friend? \n\n   Let me clarify: \n\n   The example says: \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   Wait, why 20/3? Because each toast for one friend requires 3 ml. But if we are making toasts for the entire group, then one toast (for the entire group) would require 3 ml * 3 friends? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if we make one toast for each friend, then we are making 3 toasts (one for each friend) and that requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But the example did:\n\n        drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n   This implies that they are thinking: how many single-portion toasts (each portion being for one friend) can we make? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the entire group can make T toasts per friend, meaning the entire group makes n * T toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then the drink required is n * T * nl.\n\n   However, note the example says: \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3\". \n\n   How do they get 6?\n\n   They are calculating:\n\n      drink: 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. So the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> 6 toasts (if we consider that each toast is for one friend).\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if we are making 6 toasts, that means 6 friends are having one toast (but we have 3 friends). \n\n   Actually, the example is calculating the total number of toasts (each toast being one portion for one friend) that the drink can provide: 20 / 3 = 6 (so 6 portions). Then, since there are 3 friends, the number of toasts per friend is 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n   Similarly, lime: total slices is 80. Each toast requires one slice. So 80 toasts (portions) can be made. Then 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> but wait, they don't divide the lime by 3? \n\n   Let me read again: \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Then they say \"and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts\". Then they take the minimum (6, 80, 100) and then divide by 3.\n\n   But wait, the lime: each toast (each portion) requires one slice. So 80 slices can make 80 toasts (portions). Similarly, salt: 100 portions (each requiring 1 gram). \n\n   Then the entire group can make at most 6 portions (from drink), 80 portions (from lime), and 100 portions (from salt). The limiting factor is 6 portions.\n\n   Now, since there are 3 friends, we distribute these 6 portions equally? But 6 portions for 3 friends: each friend gets 2 portions (toasts).\n\n   However, what if the portions are not divisible by the number of friends? The problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. And they must all drink the same amount.\n\n   So we cannot give a fractional toast to a friend. Therefore, the total number of toasts (portions) must be divisible by the number of friends? Or we take the floor of the total portions divided by n?\n\n   Actually, the example does: min(6,80,100) // 3. But note: 6 is an integer, and 6//3=2.\n\n   But wait, the example calculation: min(6,80,100) is 6, then divided by 3 (using integer division) gives 2.\n\n   However, the lime and salt are not constrained by the number of friends? \n\n   Let me break down:\n\n   The entire group's requirements for T toasts per friend:\n\n        Drink: n * T * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n        Lime: n * T <= c*d            => T <= (c*d) / n\n        Salt: n * T * np <= p         => T <= p / (n*np)\n\n   Then T_max = floor(min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) ))\n\n   But wait, the example uses:\n\n        Drink: (k*l) / (nl) = 20/3 ≈ 6.66 -> then divided by n (which is 3) -> 6.66/3 ≈ 2.22 -> floor 2.\n\n        However, note: the example first calculated the total toasts from drink as 20/3 (without dividing by n). \n\n   Actually, the example is doing:\n\n        From drink: total_drink = 20, and each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml -> so the total number of toasts (each toast being for one friend) that can be made is 20 // 3 = 6 (using integer division).\n\n        Then, because there are 3 friends, we can only serve 6 // 3 = 2 toasts per friend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: we are making T toasts per friend, which is equivalent to making n*T toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then:\n\n        Drink: n*T * nl <= k*l   => T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        But note: (k*l) / (n*nl) = (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so T_max = 2.\n\n   However, the example did:\n\n        total_drink_available = 20\n        drink_required_per_toast_for_entire_group = n * nl = 9\n        Then total_toasts_entire_group = 20 // 9 = 2 (if we use integer division for entire group toasts)\n\n        Then toasts per friend = 2 / n = 2/3 -> but wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\n   Actually, the example does not use entire group toasts. It uses individual toasts.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let T be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n        Then the entire group consumes:\n\n            Drink: T * n * nl\n            Lime: T * n\n            Salt: T * n * np\n\n   Then, the maximum T is the minimum of:\n\n        T1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we use integer division? But note: we are counting whole toasts per friend, so we must use integer division for the entire resource?]\n\n   But note: the resources must be sufficient for integer numbers of toasts.\n\n   However, the example calculation:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml, each friend's toast requires 3 ml -> for one friend, 3 ml per toast. But if we have 3 friends and we want T toasts per friend, then we need 3 * T * 3 = 9T ml.\n\n        Then T <= 20 / 9 -> so maximum T is 2 (since 9*2=18<=20, 9*3=27>20).\n\n        Similarly, lime: each friend's toast requires 1 slice, so for T toasts per friend, we need 3*T slices. Total slices available is 80. So T <= 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> so T=26 (if we were to use all lime) but we are limited by drink to T=2.\n\n        Salt: each friend's toast requires 1 gram, so for T toasts per friend, we need 3*T grams. We have 100 grams. T <= 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> so T=33.\n\n   Then the answer is min( floor(20/(3*3)), floor(80/3), floor(100/(3*1)) ) = min(floor(20/9), floor(80/3), floor(100/3)) = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n   However, wait: the example says: min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   What is 6? 6 is the number of toasts (each for one friend) that the drink allows: 20 // 3 = 6 (since each toast for one friend requires 3 ml). Then we divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get the per friend count.\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        T = min( (k*l) // (nl), (c*d) // 1, p // (np) )   [but wait, the lime condition is just the total slices, and the drink condition is total ml divided by ml per toast (for one friend)].\n\n   Then, after getting the total number of toasts (each for one friend) that the resources allow (by taking the minimum of the three resources, each considered per toast for one friend), we divide by the number of friends.\n\n   However, we must ensure that we are not exceeding the resources when considering the entire group.\n\n   Let me compare two methods:\n\n   Method 1 (as in example):\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n        Then, toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n   (if we use integer division)\n\n   But wait, the drink: (k*l) // nl gives the total toasts (each for one friend) from the drink.\n   Lime: c*d gives the total toasts (each for one friend) from lime.\n   Salt: p // np gives the total toasts (each for one friend) from salt.\n\n   Then the entire group can make at most total_toasts (each toast being for one friend). Then, to have the same for each friend, we must have total_toasts divisible by n? Not necessarily: we can only assign whole toasts.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n   So if we have total_toasts = 6, and n=3, then we can assign 6/3 = 2 toasts per friend.\n\n   But if total_toasts = 7, then 7 // 3 = 2 (with remainder 1). However, we cannot leave the last toast unassigned because the condition is that all friends must drink the same amount. We can only assign 2 toasts per friend (using 2*3=6 toasts) and then the remaining 1 toast is not assigned to anyone (since we cannot break the toast). \n\n   So the answer is total_toasts // n.\n\n   However, wait: is that correct?\n\n   Example 2: Input \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n   Here: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n   total_toasts from drink: (100*10) // 4 = 1000 //4 = 250\n   total_toasts from lime: 1*19 = 19\n   total_toasts from salt: 90 // 3 = 30\n\n   Then total_toasts = min(250, 19, 30) = 19.\n   Then toasts_per_friend = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19//5 is 3 with remainder 4)\n\n   The example output is 3.\n\n   Another example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n   n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n   total_toasts from drink: (1000*1000) // 50 = 1000000 //50 = 20000\n   total_toasts from lime: 25*23 = 575\n   total_toasts from salt: 1 // 1 = 1\n\n   Then total_toasts = min(20000,575,1)=1\n   Then toasts_per_friend = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n   Output is 0.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n        total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl   # because each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml\n        total_lime_toasts = c * d             # each toast (for one friend) uses 1 slice, so total slices is the total toasts\n        total_salt_toasts = p // np           # because each toast (for one friend) uses np grams of salt\n\n        total_toasts = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\n        toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n\n        Print toasts_per_friend\n\n   Why does this work?\n\n   Explanation:\n\n        We are calculating the maximum number of toasts (each being one set of resources for one friend) that can be made from each resource.\n\n        Then, the entire group can make at most 'total_toasts' toasts (each toast being for one friend). \n\n        Then, we divide by the number of friends (using integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend. This ensures that each friend gets the same number of toasts (and we don't exceed the total available toasts).\n\n   However, note: the drink calculation: (k*l) // nl gives the number of toasts (each for one friend) that the drink can support. Similarly, the lime and salt.\n\n   But wait, the drink condition: the entire drink is k*l ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml. So the maximum number of such toasts is indeed (k*l) // nl.\n\n   Similarly, lime: each toast (for one friend) requires 1 slice, so we have c*d slices -> that's the maximum toasts (each for one friend).\n\n   Salt: each toast (for one friend) requires np grams, so (p // np) is the maximum toasts (each for one friend).\n\n   Then, the entire group can only make 'total_toasts' toasts (each being for one friend) because we are limited by the scarcest resource.\n\n   Then, we distribute these toasts equally among n friends. Since we cannot have a fraction of a toast, we use floor division (total_toasts // n) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   This matches the examples.\n\n   However, note: the example calculation for drink was (k*l) // nl, but wait: the example said 20/3 (which is about 6.66) and then took floor (6) for the drink. That matches.\n\n   But note: the example also used the drink to calculate the entire group's drink requirement differently: they did 20/3 (per friend) and then said 6 toasts (meaning 6 friends could have one toast). Then they divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. \n\n   Our method: we are effectively doing:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n        Then toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        toasts_per_friend = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n\n\n   But note: the example did:\n\n        Step1: total_toasts_from_drink = 20 // 3 = 6\n        Step2: total_toasts_from_lime = 80\n        Step3: total_toasts_from_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n\n        Then total_toasts = 6\n\n        Then toasts_per_friend = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   So the code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_lime_slices = c * d\n        total_salt = p\n\n        # Calculate the maximum number of toasts (each for one friend) from each resource\n        toasts_from_drink = total_drink // nl\n        toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices   # because each toast requires one slice\n        toasts_from_salt = total_salt // np\n\n        total_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n\n        result = total_toasts // n\n\n        print(result)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n        toasts_from_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20//3 = 6\n        toasts_from_lime = 10*8 = 80\n        toasts_from_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n        total_toasts = 6\n        result = 6 // 3 = 2 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n        toasts_from_drink = 1000 //4 = 250\n        toasts_from_lime = 1*19 = 19\n        toasts_from_salt = 90//3 = 30\n        total_toasts = 19\n        result = 19 //5 = 3 -> matches.\n\n   Example 3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n        toasts_from_drink = 1000000 //50 = 20000\n        toasts_from_lime = 25*23 = 575\n        toasts_from_salt = 1//1 = 1\n        total_toasts = 1\n        result = 1//10 = 0 -> matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and between 1 and 1000.\n\n   We assume the input format is as described.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt for each friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends consume the same number of toasts without exceeding the available resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources (drink, limes, and salt). Each toast per friend requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - One slice of lime.\n   - `np` grams of salt.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves determining the limiting factor among the three resources (drink, limes, and salt) that allows the fewest toasts when distributed equally among all friends. The steps are:\n   - Calculate the total number of toasts possible from each resource when considering one toast per friend.\n   - The drink allows `(k * l) // nl` toasts.\n   - The limes allow `c * d` toasts (since each toast requires one slice).\n   - The salt allows `p // np` toasts.\n   \n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm computes the minimum of these three values to find the maximum number of toasts that can be made across all resources. This value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts, using integer division to handle any leftovers.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    toasts_from_drink = (k * l) // nl\n    toasts_from_lime = c * d\n    toasts_from_salt = p // np\n    \n    total_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n    \n    result = total_toasts // n\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: The total milliliters of drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, so the number of toasts from the drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Limes**: Each lime provides `d` slices, so the total slices are `c * d`, each allowing one toast.\n   - **Salt**: The total grams of salt available is `p`, each requiring `np` grams per toast, so the number of toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n3. **Determine Limiting Resource**: The smallest of the three values calculated above determines the maximum number of toasts that can be made.\n4. **Toast Distribution**: The total number of toasts is divided by the number of friends (`n`) using integer division to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic and comparison operations to solve the problem within the given constraints.",
