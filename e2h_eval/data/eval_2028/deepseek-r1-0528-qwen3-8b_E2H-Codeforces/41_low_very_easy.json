There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) or even try to use brute-force with state space reduction.\n However, note that the restrictions are given as intervals and we have to satisfy all. The profit is the sum of squares.\n\n Observation: Each house i can be built with height from 0 to h, but must satisfy all restrictions that cover it.\n\n We can think of the following:\n   Let A[1..n] be the heights of the houses.\n\n   For each restriction j (l_j, r_j, x_j), we require that for every i in [l_j, r_j], A[i] <= x_j.\n\n   But note: if a house is covered by multiple restrictions, then the height must be at most the minimum x_j of all restrictions covering that house.\n\n However, there is an additional twist: we can choose the heights arbitrarily (as long as they are <= h) and we want to maximize the sum of squares.\n\n Important: The square function is convex and increasing for nonnegative numbers. So for each house, we want to set the height as high as possible (but not exceeding the minimum x_j from restrictions that cover it and also not exceeding h).\n\n BUT: wait, what if two restrictions interact? Consider: \n   Suppose we have two restrictions: one says [1,2] must be <= 3, and another says [2,3] must be <= 2. Then house 2 must be <= min(3,2)=2.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the entire street is covered by restrictions. Some houses might not be covered by any restriction, then we can set them up to h.\n\n However, there is a catch: the restrictions might not be independent. But note that the requirement is that for each restriction, the maximum in the interval is <= x_i.\n\n But here's the key: The restriction only constrains the maximum in the interval, so if we set a house to a very high value, then if that house is the maximum in some interval, the entire interval must be <= that value? \n\n Actually, no: the restriction says the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_i. So if we set a house to a value a, then for any restriction that covers that house, we must have a <= x_i. Moreover, for a restriction that doesn't cover that house, we don't care about that house.\n\n However, the catch is that a house might be forced to be low because of one restriction, but then if we set it too low, we lose profit. But we can set each house independently to the minimum of:\n   - h\n   - the maximum allowed by all restrictions that cover that house\n\n However, wait: is that sufficient?\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   If we set house1 = 1 (because of the first restriction), house2 = 3 (because the second restriction allows 3, and there's no other restriction that forces it lower?), house3=2 (from the third restriction). Then profit is 1+9+4=14.\n\n   Now, consider: what if we set house2 to 2? Then the first restriction is satisfied (house1=1), the second restriction requires that the tallest in [2,2] is <=3 -> 2<=3 is ok, and the third restriction requires house3<=2. Then we can set house3=2. Then profit is 1+4+4=9, which is worse.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 0? Then we get 0+9+4=13, which is worse.\n\n   So indeed, we set house1 to the maximum allowed (which is 1) because the restriction says so, and similarly for others.\n\n   However, consider a more complex example:\n\n   Restrictions: \n        [1,3] must be <= 5\n        [2,4] must be <= 3\n\n   Then house1: only the first restriction -> max allowed 5, but wait: house1 is only in [1,3] so it must be <=5, but also note that house1 is not in [2,4]. So house1 can be up to 5.\n   House2: both [1,3] and [2,4] -> min(5,3)=3.\n   House3: [1,3] and [2,4] -> min(5,3)=3.\n   House4: [2,4] -> 3.\n\n   Now, is this correct? Yes.\n\n   But note: the first restriction says the tallest house in [1,3] must be <=5. If we set house1 to 5, house2 to 3, house3 to 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses. Each house can be built with a height between 0 and a given maximum height \\( h \\), but must satisfy all restrictions that apply to its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a particular range must not exceed a certain height. The key observation is that for each house, the maximum allowable height is the minimum of:\n   - The overall maximum height \\( h \\).\n   - The heights specified by all restrictions that include that house.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, we first determine the maximum height it can have without violating any restrictions. This involves checking all restrictions that cover the house and taking the smallest \\( x_i \\) value from those restrictions. Once the maximum allowable height for each house is determined, the optimal height for maximizing profit (since the profit function is \\( a^2 \\)) is simply the highest allowable height, as the square function is strictly increasing for non-negative values.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves processing each restriction to compute the minimum allowable height for each house. This can be efficiently done by iterating over each restriction and updating the maximum allowed height for each house in the specified range. After processing all restrictions, each house's height is set to the minimum of its computed allowable height and the overall maximum height \\( h \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\( m \\) restrictions, and for each restriction, it updates \\( (r_i - l_i + 1) \\) houses. Given that \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are at most 50, the total operations are manageable (up to \\( 50 \\times 50 = 2500 \\)), making the approach efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h_max = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n    \n    allowed_heights = [h_max] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for l, r, x_val in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x_val < allowed_heights[i]:\n                allowed_heights[i] = x_val\n    \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        height = allowed_heights[i]\n        total_profit += height * height\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spots \\( n \\), the maximum height \\( h \\), and the number of restrictions \\( m \\). Each restriction is then read and stored in a list.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `allowed_heights` is initialized to store the maximum allowable height for each house. Initially, all houses can be built up to height \\( h \\).\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code checks all houses within the specified range and updates their maximum allowable height to the minimum value between the current allowable height and the restriction's height limit.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all restrictions are satisfied while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and straightforward array updates.",
