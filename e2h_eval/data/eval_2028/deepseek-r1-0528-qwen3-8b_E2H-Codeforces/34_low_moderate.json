And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n So, we have total_weeks = n - k + 1.\n\n The total sleep time over all weeks is: \n   sum_weeks = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_k) + ... + (a_{n-k} + ... + a_{n-1})\n\n How can we compute this without iterating through each week (which would be O(n*k))?\n\n Notice that each element a[i] appears in exactly (min(i+1, k) to min(n-i, n-k+1))? \n\n Actually, let's count for an element at index i (0-indexed):\n\n The week starting at j must satisfy: j <= i <= j+k-1 and also j from 0 to n-k.\n\n Therefore, j can range from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   The first week that includes a[i] starts at index start_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   The last week that includes a[i] ends at index start_max = i (because the week starting at i will include a[i] only if i+k-1 < n, but actually we don't need that)\n\n Actually, the week starting at j must be such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, but also j>=0 and j<=n-k.\n\n So the number of weeks that include a[i] is: \n   count_i = min(i, k-1, n-i-1+k?) \n\n Let me re-express:\n\n   j must be in [max(0, i - k + 1), min(i, n-k)]? \n\n Actually, the week starting at j must cover a[i] and the week must be entirely in [0, n-k] (so j from 0 to n-k).\n\n Conditions for j:\n   j <= i <= j+k-1   =>   j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n And j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). \n\n So the valid j are from L = max(0, i-k+1) to R = min(i, n-k) [but wait, the condition j<=i and j>=i-k+1, and j<=n-k and j>=0].\n\n Actually, the condition j<=i is automatically satisfied by j>=i-k+1 and i-k+1<=i (if k>=1). But note: j must be at most n-k.\n\n So the number of j is: \n   left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because j cannot exceed n-k\n\n Then the count for a[i] is: \n   count_i = max(0, right_bound - left_bound + 1)   if we use inclusive bounds.\n\n However, note: the week starting at j must end at j+k-1, which must be < n (since indices go from 0 to n-1). The condition for j is j <= n-k (because then j+k-1 <= n-1).\n\n So the formula for the total sum is: \n   total_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of weeks containing a[i])\n\n But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. Each week is defined as a contiguous subarray of length `k` days. The challenge is to compute the average efficiently without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a sequence of `n` days. The naive approach would involve summing each week's sleep times and then averaging them, but this would result in an O(n*k) time complexity, which is inefficient for large `n` and `k`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Each element in the sequence contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position `i` will appear in all weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. This allows us to compute the total sum of all weeks' sleep times by summing each element multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each week. However, instead of processing each week individually, we leverage the observation that each element's contribution can be calculated once and then used across all relevant weeks.\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: To further optimize, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. This reduces the time complexity to O(n), making it suitable for large inputs.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element once to determine its contribution and uses a prefix sum array for constant-time range sum queries. The overall time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(n):\n        left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right = min(i, n - k)\n        count = right - left + 1 if right >= left else 0\n        total_sum += a[i] * count\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of each week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If there are no valid weeks (i.e., `total_weeks` is zero), the output is immediately set to \"0.0000000000\".\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: A prefix sum array is constructed to allow efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n4. **Element Contribution Calculation**: For each element in the sequence, the number of weeks it appears in is determined by its position. The total sum of all weeks' sleep times is computed by summing each element's contribution (element value multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in).\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is derived by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging mathematical insights and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
