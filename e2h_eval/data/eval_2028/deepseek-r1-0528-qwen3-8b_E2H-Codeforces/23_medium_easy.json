In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in one line, but the example input is given as a list of three strings. However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\". Each string is a tile? Actually, the example input is given as:\n Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input format is actually three tiles in a single line, separated by spaces? Or is it three separate strings (each being one tile) in one line?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n And each tile is represented as a two-character string: first a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', 's'.\n\n However, the example input is given as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems to be a representation of three test cases. But the problem says: The only line.\n\n Actually, the example input is provided in the note as three separate examples. So the actual input for one test case is just one line with three tiles? Or three lines?\n\n The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n Example input: \n   \"1s 2s 3s\"   -> but wait, that would be three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"?\n\n But the example input is written as: \n   ['1s 2s 3s', ...]\n\n Actually, looking at the example output: \n   ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So there are three test cases. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. \n\n However, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input.\n\n Clarification: The input has only one line, which contains three strings. But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n   Input:\n      ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing because the example input is presented as a list of three strings, but the problem says the input is one line.\n\n Let me re-read: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So the input is one line with three strings (each string being one tile). Therefore, the entire input is:\n\n   \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n   or\n\n   \"9m 9m 9m\"\n\n   or\n\n   \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the third example has three tiles: \"3p\", \"9m\", \"2p\". So each tile is a string of length 2.\n\n However, note that the example input is given as a list of three strings. That might be because the problem note includes three examples.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line\" meaning one line per test case. But the example shows three test cases. \n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the description. Then the example input is given as three examples. \n\n But the problem does not specify the number of test cases. However, the example input is one line.\n\n Since the problem says \"The only line\", it implies that there is one test case per run. But the example input is shown with three test cases.\n\n I think the example input in the note is just showing three different examples. The actual input is one test case.\n\n So, we can assume the input is one line containing three tiles, each tile being a two-character string.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n But wait, how is that one line? It would be one line: \"1s 2s 3s\", and then we split that into three tokens.\n\n Alternatively, it could be three separate lines? But the problem says \"one line\".\n\n So, we read one line and split it by space to get three strings.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split it to get three strings.\n\n 2. We have three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu.\n\n What are the possibilities?\n\n We can form a mentsu by either:\n   - A koutsu: three identical tiles (same number and same suit).\n   - A shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) and same suit.\n\n We are allowed to draw any tile (any number and any suit) arbitrarily many times.\n\n We start with three tiles. We can draw 0, 1, 2, ... until we have a set of four or more tiles that contains at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu (which is three tiles) to exist in the hand.\n\n So, we can consider:\n\n Option 0: Already have a mentsu? Then answer 0.\n\n Otherwise, we consider:\n\n Option 1: Drawing 1 tile.\n\n Option 2: Drawing 2 tiles.\n\n Option 3: Drawing 3 tiles.\n\n But note: the problem asks the minimum number of extra tiles.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: If we already have a mentsu, then 0.\n\n Case 2: We don't have a mentsu, but we can form one by drawing 1 or 2 or 3 tiles.\n\n However, note: we can also consider that sometimes we might need to draw 4 tiles? But wait, let me think:\n\n With three tiles, if we draw one, we have four. Then we can form a mentsu from three of them.\n\n Similarly, with two draws we have five, and with three draws we have six.\n\n But we are to find the minimum.\n\n We can check:\n\n Possibility 0: Check if the three tiles already form a mentsu.\n\n Possibility 1: Check if by drawing 1 tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n Possibility 2: Check if by drawing 2 tiles we can form a mentsu.\n\n Possibility 3: Check if by drawing 3 tiles we can form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. So we can choose the best possible tile(s) to complete the mentsu.\n\n How to check for koutsu:\n\n   We need three identical tiles. So we can count frequency per tile type (by suit and number).\n\n   In the initial three tiles, if we have three of the same, then we have a koutsu.\n\n   Otherwise, we can try to draw two more of the same tile to complete a koutsu? But wait, we can also form a koutsu by having two of one kind and then drawing one more? Then total draws=1.\n\n   Similarly, we can form a koutsu by having one of a kind and then drawing two? Then total draws=2.\n\n   Or by having zero of a kind, then we draw three? But wait, we can also consider that we might form a koutsu from three distinct tiles? No, koutsu requires three identical.\n\n   So for koutsu:\n\n     If we have three of the same: 0 draws.\n\n     Else if we have two of the same: then we can complete with one more -> 1 draw.\n\n     Else if we have one of the same (meaning each distinct): then we need two more -> 2 draws.\n\n     But note: we can also form a koutsu by drawing three of a different tile? Actually, we can choose any tile. So we can choose to form a koutsu for a tile that we don't even have. However, we are allowed to draw any tile.\n\n   However, wait: we can also form a shuntsu. So we need to consider both possibilities.\n\n Similarly for shuntsu:\n\n   Conditions: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   We can check for each suit separately.\n\n   But note: the hand has three tiles. They might be of different suits.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n     - All three tiles are in the same suit and form a sequence? Then 0 draws.\n\n     - Otherwise, we can try to form a sequence by drawing one or two tiles.\n\n   How?\n\n     For a given suit, we can look at the numbers. But note: we might have two tiles in the same suit and one in another.\n\n   Steps for shuntsu:\n\n     Group by suit.\n\n     For each suit, we have a list of numbers.\n\n     Then, for each suit, we can sort the numbers and check for consecutive triplets.\n\n     However, we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can complete a sequence by drawing the missing tile.\n\n     Example: [1m, 2m] -> we can draw 3m to complete the sequence.\n\n     Also, we might have two non-consecutive tiles? For example, [1m, 3m] -> we can draw 2m to make a sequence.\n\n     But note: sequences must be consecutive and of three numbers.\n\n     However, we are not limited to having the three tiles in the same suit. We can use one tile from the hand and two drawn from the same suit, or two from the hand and one drawn, etc.\n\n     But note: the hand initially has three tiles.\n\n     We want to know the minimum draws to form at least one mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n Approach:\n\n We can consider two types: koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n But note: we can also form a mentsu by combining both? Actually, no: koutsu is three identical, shuntsu is three consecutive same suit.\n\n We are to find the minimum draws.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   Option 0: 0 draws -> if we have a koutsu OR a shuntsu.\n\n   Option 1: 1 draw -> if we can form a koutsu by drawing one (i.e., we have two of one tile) OR form a shuntsu by drawing one (i.e., we have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive and only one is missing, or we have two tiles that are two apart and the middle is missing, but wait, we can also have two tiles that are not consecutive but we can complete with one in between? Actually, for shuntsu:\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m] -> then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (if we have two and the next one is missing) -> then we have a shuntsu.\n\n        Another: [1m, 3m] -> then we can draw 2m to form [1m,2m,3m].\n\n        But what if we have three tiles? We might have two in the same suit and one in another, and then we can complete the shuntsu by drawing one.\n\n        Also, we can form a koutsu by drawing one if we have two of the same.\n\n   Option 2: 2 draws -> if we don't complete by 0 or 1, then we try 2.\n\n        For koutsu: if we have one of a kind, then we need two more to complete a triplet (so 2 draws).\n\n        For shuntsu: we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two. Examples:\n\n            - We have two tiles that are two apart and we need the middle one: [1m, 3m] -> we can draw 2m (one draw) but wait, that's one. Then two draws: maybe we have no two in the same suit, but we can form two different sequences? Actually, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles if we have one tile in a suit and we need two consecutive ones.\n\n            Example: [1m] -> then we can draw [2m,3m] to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, that uses the existing 1m and adds two, so two draws). \n\n            Another: [2m, 4m] -> we can draw 3m (one draw) to complete [2m,3m,4m]? Actually, yes: [2m,3m,4m] is a sequence. But wait, [2m,4m] and we draw 3m: that's one draw. So that falls under 1 draw.\n\n            However, consider: [1m, 4m] -> we can draw two tiles: 2m and 3m? Then we have [1m,4m,2m,3m] and then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (leaving 4m). So that's one mentsu (the [1m,2m,3m]) and we used two draws.\n\n            But note: we don't have to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu. So with [1m,4m] and drawing 2m and 3m, we have four tiles and we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using three of the four). So that's valid.\n\n            However, we can also consider: [1m,4m] -> we can draw 2m and 3m to complete two sequences? Actually, we are only required one mentsu.\n\n        There's also the possibility of forming two koutsus? Not necessary.\n\n        Actually, the problem is: we start with three tiles, and we can draw up to two, so we have five tiles. Then we can form one mentsu.\n\n        How about: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> already two 1m and one 2m. Then we can draw one 1m to complete the koutsu (then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the 2m is extra). So that's one draw.\n\n        But what if we don't have two of the same and no two consecutive in the same suit? Then we might need two draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2p, 3s] -> no same suit and no consecutive same suit. Then we can draw two tiles to form a mentsu.\n\n        How? We can choose to form a koutsu: say, draw two 1m (then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the other two are ignored). Or we can choose to form a shuntsu: draw two tiles to complete a sequence. But note: we can choose the same tile for koutsu. \n\n        Actually, we are free to choose any tiles. So we can choose to form a koutsu for any tile we wish.\n\n        So for [1m, 2p, 3s]:\n\n          Option: Draw two 1m -> then we have [1m,1m,1m] (and the others are irrelevant) -> koutsu.\n\n          Option: Or we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles: for example, we can draw two tiles of the same suit and form a sequence? Actually, we can choose to draw two tiles in the same suit. For example, choose suit 'm': we have one tile (1m). Then we can draw two tiles: 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (a shuntsu). \n\n        So two draws.\n\n        But wait, is there a way with one draw? \n\n        With one draw, we have four tiles: [1m,2p,3s,X]. \n\n        To form a koutsu: we need three identical. We have none. So we cannot form a koutsu.\n\n        To form a shuntsu: we need three consecutive in the same suit. We have one tile of each suit. Then we can only form a shuntsu in one suit. We have one tile in suit 'm' (1m). Then we can draw two more to complete the sequence? But we are only drawing one. So we can only complete one gap. Then we have two tiles in suit 'm': 1m and (say) 2m. Then we can form a shuntsu if we had 3m, but we don't. Alternatively, we have 1m and 2m, then we need 3m, but we drew one tile. We can draw 3m, then we have [1m,2p,3s,3m] -> now we have 1m and 3m (with no 2m) so no shuntsu. Or we draw 2m: then we have [1m,2p,3s,2m] -> now we have two 2m? But wait, the suit 'm' has two tiles: 1m and 2m. Then we don't have a sequence. \n\n        Alternatively, we draw a tile in a new suit? Then we have two tiles in that suit? Then we have two tiles in two different suits, and one tile remains. Then we cannot form a shuntsu.\n\n        So no, one draw is not enough.\n\n        Therefore, two draws is the minimum.\n\n        But wait, we can also consider: maybe we can form a koutsu by drawing two of the same tile. For example, we can draw two 1m, then we have three 1m (koutsu). So that's two draws.\n\n        Or we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles: as above, two draws.\n\n        So the minimum is two.\n\n        However, note: we can also consider forming a koutsu for a tile that we don't have. We are free to choose any tile. So we can choose to form a koutsu of any tile we like.\n\n        But the problem: we are to compute the minimum.\n\n        Now, we must consider: we might complete a mentsu by drawing one or two tiles, but note that we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles in some cases, but also a koutsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n        How do we systematically compute the minimum?\n\n        We can consider:\n\n        Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n        Step 1: Check if we already have a mentsu (0 draws). \n\n        Step 2: If not, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 1 tile (1 draw).\n\n        Step 3: If not, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 2 tiles (2 draws).\n\n        Step 4: Otherwise, 3 draws.\n\n        But note: the problem says we can draw any tile. So we are free to choose.\n\n        However, we must consider that we might form a mentsu by combining with drawn tiles in two different ways.\n\n        How to check for 0 draws:\n\n          Check for koutsu: \n            Count the frequency of each tile (by name, which is the whole string). \n            If any tile appears three times, then koutsu exists.\n\n          Check for shuntsu:\n            Group tiles by suit. For each suit, extract the numbers, convert to integers, and sort.\n            Then, for each suit, check if there is a consecutive sequence of three numbers.\n\n        How to check for 1 draw:\n\n          We can complete a koutsu by drawing one tile: if there is a tile that already appears two times, then drawing one more of the same will complete the triplet.\n\n          We can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile: \n\n            Condition: There must be a suit that has at least two tiles, and the two tiles are consecutive or two apart (so that the middle is missing) OR we have one tile and we can form a sequence by adding two consecutive numbers (but wait, we are only allowed to draw one). \n\n            Actually, for shuntsu: we need three consecutive numbers. \n\n            Possibilities:\n\n              Case 1: Two tiles in the same suit and they are consecutive (like 1 and 2) -> then we need 3 (if the numbers are 1 and 2, then 3 is missing). Then drawing 3 completes the sequence.\n\n              Case 2: Two tiles in the same suit and they are two apart (like 1 and 3) -> then we need 2 (the middle) to complete the sequence.\n\n            But note: the tiles in the hand might be more than two in a suit? Then we can use two of them and the drawn one to form a sequence.\n\n            Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we have three tiles in the same suit. Then we can form a sequence from [1m,2m,?] and we don't have 3m. But wait, we have 4m. However, we can use [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m). So we only need to draw 3m.\n\n            However, we can also form [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 3m.\n\n            So the condition for a suit is: we have a set of numbers (at least two) and we can form a consecutive triplet by drawing one tile.\n\n            How to check for a given suit:\n\n              Let the numbers (for a particular suit) be sorted. Then we can consider:\n\n                We need to have a triplet (n, n+1, n+2). We can check if we have two of the same number? Actually, no: the definition requires distinct numbers? Actually, the definition of shuntsu: sequential numbered tiles. So the numbers must be distinct and consecutive.\n\n            So for a suit, we can have duplicate numbers? Then we can use one occurrence for the consecutive sequence. But note: the hand has three tiles. We can use at most one occurrence per number.\n\n            Actually, the hand might have duplicates. But for shuntsu, we need distinct numbers.\n\n            So for a given suit, we consider the distinct numbers? Or we can use the same tile twice? No, because we have three distinct tiles (even if they are the same representation, but the tile is defined by its suit and number). \n\n            However, note: the hand may have duplicate tiles. Then we can use one occurrence for the sequence.\n\n            Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> we can use one 1m and one 2m, and then we are missing 3m. So we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m.\n\n            But wait, we have two 1m. Then we can also form a koutsu with the two 1m and drawing one more 1m. \n\n            So for shuntsu, we can use the available distinct numbers (or even if there are duplicates, we only need one occurrence of each number).\n\n            Therefore, for a suit, we can extract the set of distinct numbers and then check for a consecutive triplet that we can complete by drawing one tile.\n\n            Conditions for a given suit:\n\n              Let S be the set of distinct numbers in this suit.\n\n              We want to know if there exists an integer n such that {n, n+1, n+2} is a subset of S ∪ {x} for some x (the drawn tile) and |S ∪ {x}| <= the number of distinct numbers we have plus one.\n\n              But note: we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can add one number. Then we need to check if there is an n such that:\n\n                  Either:\n                    - {n, n+1, n+2} ⊆ S ∪ {x} for some x, and |S| + (1 if x not in S else 0) = the size of S after adding, and we only add one.\n\n              Alternatively, we can check:\n\n                We can complete a sequence if:\n\n                  Case 1: There is a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) that is missing one number, and that number is not present in S.\n\n                  Case 2: There is a sequence (n, n+1, n+2) that is missing two numbers, but wait, we can only draw one. So we cannot complete two missing numbers.\n\n                  Actually, we can only complete one missing number.\n\n            So for a given suit, we can consider:\n\n              We have a set of numbers T (distinct).\n\n              We want to check if there exists an n such that:\n\n                {n, n+1, n+2} has at most two elements in common with T, and the third element is not in T.\n\n              But note: we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can cover exactly one missing element.\n\n            However, we can also consider sequences that we can form by using two of the current tiles and one drawn.\n\n            Actually, the drawn tile can be used as any one of the three. So we can have:\n\n              Option A: The drawn tile is the smallest (n), then we require n+1 and n+2 to be in T.\n\n              Option B: The drawn tile is the middle (n+1), then we require n and n+2 to be in T.\n\n              Option C: The drawn tile is the largest (n+2), then we require n and n+1 to be in T.\n\n            Therefore, for a suit, we can iterate over n from 1 to 7 (because the numbers go from 1 to 9) and check:\n\n              For Option A: if (n+1) in T and (n+2) in T, then we can complete by drawing n.\n\n              For Option B: if (n-1) in T and (n+1) in T, then we can complete by drawing n (here n must be between 2 and 8).\n\n              For Option C: if (n-2) in T and (n-1) in T, then we can complete by drawing n (here n must be between 3 and 10).\n\n            But note: n must be between 1 and 9.\n\n            However, we can also consider that the drawn tile must be in the range [1,9].\n\n            So for a given suit, we can check for any n in [1,9] (but we must check the conditions above) and if any condition is true, then we can complete a shuntsu in that suit by drawing one tile.\n\n            But note: the hand might have multiple suits. We only need one mentsu.\n\n        However, we must consider: we might complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile from a suit that has two or more tiles. \n\n        Steps for 1 draw:\n\n          Check for koutsu: if there is a tile that appears at least two times, then we can complete by drawing one more (so 1 draw).\n\n          Check for shuntsu: for each suit (m, p, s), if the suit has at least two distinct numbers (or even one distinct number and we can complete the sequence by drawing one) then check the above conditions for that suit.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to choose any tile. So we can complete a shuntsu in any suit by drawing one tile (if the conditions above hold for that suit).\n\n        Similarly, for 2 draws:\n\n          Check for koutsu: if there is a tile that appears once, then we can complete by drawing two more (so 2 draws).\n\n          Check for shuntsu: \n\n            We can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n            Possibilities:\n\n              Option 1: The drawn two tiles complete the sequence. Then we need to check: for a suit, we have some numbers and we can form a sequence by adding two numbers.\n\n              Conditions for a suit:\n\n                We can complete a sequence if:\n\n                  There exists an n such that:\n\n                    We are missing two numbers from {n, n+1, n+2}. But note: we can use existing numbers. \n\n                Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                  We can form a sequence if:\n\n                    Option A: We have one number, then we need to draw the other two.\n\n                    Option B: We have two numbers, but they are not consecutive and not two apart (so we need two numbers to complete). \n\n                    Example: [1m, 4m] -> we need 2m and 3m.\n\n                    Option C: We have two numbers that are consecutive (like 1m and 2m) but we are missing the third (so we need one, which we already checked) -> so that's 1 draw.\n\n                    Option D: We have two numbers that are two apart (like 1m and 3m) -> then we need the middle, which is one draw.\n\n                So for two draws, we look for a suit where we have at least one distinct number and we are missing two numbers for a consecutive triplet.\n\n                Actually, we can generalize:\n\n                  For a suit, we have a set T of distinct numbers.\n\n                  We want to know if there exists an n such that {n, n+1, n+2} has at least one number in T, and the remaining two numbers are not in T.\n\n                  Then we can complete by drawing those two missing numbers.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to draw two tiles. So we can draw the two missing numbers.\n\n                However, there is another possibility: we can complete two different sequences? But we only need one.\n\n            But wait: we can also complete a koutsu by drawing two tiles (if we have one occurrence of a tile, then we can draw two more to get three). \n\n            So for koutsu, if there is at least one tile that appears once, then we can complete by drawing two.\n\n            For shuntsu, we can complete by drawing two if we have at least one tile in a suit and the two missing numbers for a consecutive triplet are not present.\n\n        However, note: we can mix and match. But the problem is: we are free to choose any tiles. So we can choose to form a koutsu in one tile type or a shuntsu in one suit.\n\n        Therefore, the minimum number of draws is the minimum among:\n\n          - 0 if we have a mentsu.\n\n          - 1 if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile (either by completing a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n          - 2 if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n          - 3 otherwise.\n\n        But wait, is 3 always the maximum? Actually, the problem says we can draw any tiles, so we can always form a mentsu by drawing three tiles: for example, draw three copies of the same tile (if we have zero or one) to form a koutsu. \n\n        However, we might also form a shuntsu by drawing three tiles: but koutsu is easier (we can always do koutsu with three draws: take any tile and draw three copies). \n\n        But note: we might form a koutsu for a tile that we don't have, so we draw three of that tile.\n\n        Therefore, the answer can be 0,1,2, or 3.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require to use the minimal number of draws beyond three. But the problem says \"minimum\", so we can stop at 3.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n        Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n          koutsu0 = False\n          suits_count = {'m': [], 'p': [], 's': []}\n          tile_count = {}\n          for tile in tiles:\n              tile_count[tile] = tile_count.get(tile,0) + 1\n              # Also, we can break tile into (number, suit)\n              num = int(tile[0])\n              s = tile[1]\n              suits_count[s].append(num)\n\n          koutsu0 = any(count>=3 for count in tile_count.values()) or any(len(s_list)>=3 and len(set(s_list))==3 and sorted(s_list) in [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],...,[7,8,9]]? Wait, no: koutsu is three identical, so we already counted by tile_count.\n\n          Actually, koutsu0 = any(tile_count[tile] == 3 for tile in tile_count)\n\n          For shuntsu0: \n            for s in ['m','p','s']:\n                if len(suits_count[s]) >= 3:\n                    nums = sorted(suits_count[s])\n                    # Remove duplicates?

However, the hand has three tiles, and if we have duplicates then we have less than three distinct numbers in that suit.\n                    # Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> distinct numbers: {1,2}.
