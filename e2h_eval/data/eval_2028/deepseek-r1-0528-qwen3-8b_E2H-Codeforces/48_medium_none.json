He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one which might be 'R' (for Roman numerals) for b.\n Then a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). However, note that if b is 'R', then the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split into tokens. There will be two tokens.\n 2. Check if the second token is 'R'. If yes, then we have to convert the given number from base a to a decimal (base-10) integer first, then convert that decimal integer to a Roman numeral.\n    But note: the input number is given in base a, so we must first decode it from base a to base-10.\n\n 3. If the second token is an integer (convert it to int), then we need to convert the given base-a number to base-b (which is an integer base between 2 and 25).\n\n However, note: the input number c is given as a string (possibly with leading zeros) in base a. We must first convert that string (from base a) to a base-10 integer.\n\n Important: The base a is between 2 and 25, and the digits in the string can be digits from '0' to '9' and letters from 'A' onward (if base >10) but note the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n But note: the input string may contain digits beyond '9'? Actually, the input is given as a string of digits (each digit representing a value from 0 to a-1). For bases above 10, we use letters from 'A' to ... (but the base is at most 25, so we only need up to base-25, so digits from '0' to 'Z' but only up to 24, i.e., 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, ..., 'Y' for 34? Actually, wait: base a is from 2 to 25, so the digits used in the input string can be from '0' to the digit representing a-1.\n\n However, note: the example includes base 12 and the digit 'A' (which is 10). So we have to map the characters to their numeric values.\n\n How to handle base conversion?\n\n Step 1: Convert the input string from base a to base 10.\n\n Let s = the input string (without spaces, as per the problem: next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a)\n\n We'll traverse each character in s (from left to right) and convert each digit to its value (if the char is a digit, then int(char), if it's a letter then ord(char) - ord('A') + 10). But wait, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n However, note: the input string might have leading zeros.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10, base 2, and the number is \"1\" in base 10 -> which is 1 in base 10. Then convert 1 to base 2: \"1\".\n\n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16, and the number is \"5\" (which is 5 in base 16, so 5 in decimal). Then convert 5 to Roman: \"V\".\n\n   Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base 5, the number is \"4\", which is 4 in base 5? Actually, wait: the input is a non-negative integer in base a. So \"4\" in base 5 is 4*5^0 = 4. Then convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\".\n\n   Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base 2 to base 2, so just output the same string without leading zeros? But note: the problem says to omit leading zeros. However, the example output is \"1111001\". But wait, the input is \"1111001\" which has no leading zeros? Actually, the input can have leading zeros, but the example doesn't. We have to remove any leading zeros in the output.\n\n   Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12 to base 13. The input number is \"A\", which in base 12 is 10. Then convert 10 to base 13: how? \n        10 // 13 = 0 remainder 10 -> so the digit for 10 in base13 is represented by 'A'? But wait, base13 uses digits from 0 to 12. Typically, we represent 10 as 'A', 11 as 'B', 12 as 'C'. So output 'A'.\n\n However, note: the problem says for bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So when converting to base b (which is an integer base between 2 and 25), we must use digits for numbers from 0 to b-1. We'll map:\n\n   For base b, we have:\n      digits: \n        if the value is less than 10: use str(value)\n        else: use chr(ord('A') + value - 10)\n\n But note: the problem says the base b is between 2 and 25, so we don't have to worry about base beyond 36.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: b is 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer.\n        How to convert: \n            Let base_a = a (integer)\n            Let num_base10 = 0\n            Let power = 1\n            For each char in reversed(c):\n                d = convert_char(char): \n                    if char in '0' to '9': d = int(char)\n                    else: d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                But wait: what if the base a is 11? Then the digit 'A' is allowed only if a>10. However, the input string c is given in base a, so all digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. \n\n            However, note: the input string might have digits that are invalid for base a? The problem says: \"a non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume valid.\n\n            Example: base 5, string \"4\" -> valid, because 4 < 5.\n\n            But what if base 16 and string \"G\"? Then that would be invalid, but the problem states: the input is valid.\n\n        Then, after converting to base10, we have an integer n (which is at least 1 because if Roman is included, the number is guaranteed to be at least 1 and <= 300010).\n\n   Step 2: Convert the base10 integer n to a Roman numeral.\n\n Case 2: b is an integer base (between 2 and 25)\n   Step 1: Convert the string c (base a) to base10 integer (same as above).\n   Step 2: Convert the base10 integer to base b (without leading zeros).\n\n However, note: there is an alternative: we could avoid converting to base10 for the Roman case and just do the conversion from base a to base b (if b is integer) without going through base10? But the problem says the input number is in base a, and we need to convert to base b (or Roman). Since the base a is at most 25, the base10 conversion is feasible because the number has at most 1000 digits. But 1000 digits in base 25: the maximum value is 25^1000 which is astronomically large. We cannot use standard base conversion (using base10) for such large numbers because the base10 representation might be too big to handle with integers (unless we use arbitrary precision, but then we have to do the conversion without base10?).\n\n But note: the problem says for the case when b is not 'R', the number won't be greater than 10^15^10? Actually, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". Wait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n    \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n This seems ambiguous. Let me read: \n    \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n Actually, I think the problem intended to say: the decimal value (base10) of the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 if b is 'R'. And for the other cases (b is integer base), the decimal value is <= 10^15^10? That doesn't make sense. \n\n Let me re-read: \n    \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\"\n\n But wait, 101510 is a specific number. However, the input string can be up to 1000 digits long. The guarantee is on the decimal value? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n    \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\"\n\n So, if b is not 'R', then the decimal value of the input number (base a) is at most 101510 (which is about 10^5). \n\n But wait, that would mean that even though the input string can be up to 1000 digits, the actual value is small (<= 101510). \n\n So we can safely convert the input string (which is in base a) to a base10 integer, because the base10 integer is at most 101510 (if b is not 'R') or at most 300010 (if b is 'R'). \n\n However, note: the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and the input string can be up to 1000 digits. But the decimal value is bounded by 101510 (for non-Roman) or 300010 (for Roman). \n\n Therefore, we can convert the entire string to base10 (as an integer) and then process further.\n\n Steps for base conversion (from base a to base10):\n\n   n = 0\n   power = 1\n   for each character in the string (from left to right):\n        digit_value = convert_char(char)   # from char to integer in [0, a-1]\n        n = n * a + digit_value\n\n But wait: if the string has 1000 digits, then we are doing 1000 multiplications by a (which is at most 25) and adding a digit (max 24). The maximum value we get is 101510 (if non-Roman) or 300010 (if Roman). So even though the string is 1000 digits, the base10 integer is bounded by 101510 (so we can do this).\n\n However, let me check: the maximum base10 value for a 1000-digit number in base 25 is (25^1000 - 1) which is way beyond 101510. But the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". So we are guaranteed that the decimal value is <= 101510. Therefore, the input string, even though it can be up to 1000 digits, must represent a number that is at most 101510 (if b is not 'R').\n\n Similarly, for Roman, the decimal value is at most 300010.\n\n So we can safely convert the entire string to base10.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the first line and split to tokens: tokens = [x.strip() for x in input().split()]\n   tokens[0] is a, tokens[1] is b.\n\n   Then read the next line: s = input().strip()\n\n   Convert a to integer (if the second token is not 'R').\n\n   Then, convert the string s from base a to base10 integer.\n\n   If tokens[1] is 'R':\n        Convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n   Else:\n        Convert the base10 integer to base b (integer) and output the digits (without leading zeros).\n\n Now, how to convert base10 to Roman?\n\n   We know the rules: \n        I: 1, V:5, X:10, L:50, C:100, D:500, M:1000.\n\n   And subtractive: IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), XC (90), CD (400), CM (900).\n\n   Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        Since the number is at most 300010, we can handle up to 300000 (which is MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM) but wait, 300010 is 300010.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a list of integer values and corresponding symbols.\n\n        Standard way:\n\n        roman_map = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n\n        Then, for a given number n (from 1 to 300010):\n            res = []\n            for value, symbol in roman_map:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res.append(symbol)\n                    n -= value\n            return ''.join(res)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number for Roman is not zero.\n\n        But wait: the example: 4 -> IV, 5 -> V, 9 -> IX.\n\n        Let's test with 4: \n            n=4\n            Check 1000: no, 900: no, ... until (5, 'V'): 4<5 -> skip, then (4, 'IV'): 4>=4 -> use 'IV', then n becomes 0. So returns \"IV\" -> correct.\n\n        But note: the example input \"5 R\\n4\": \n            First, convert \"4\" from base5 to base10: 4 (since base5: 4 is 4). Then convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\".\n\n        Example input \"16 R\\n5\": \n            Convert \"5\" from base16 to base10: 5. Then convert 5 to Roman: \n                n=5: \n                1000: no, 900: no, 500: no, 400: no, 100: no, 90: no, 50: no, 40: no, 10: no, 9: no, 5: yes -> use 'V', then n=0 -> returns \"V\".\n\n        Example input \"5 R\\n4\": \n            Convert \"4\" from base5: base5 digits: 4 is valid. Value = 4. Then convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\".\n\n        Example input \"10 2\\n1\": \n            Convert \"1\" from base10: 1. Then convert 1 to base2: \n                We'll write a function to convert base10 to base b (integer base).\n\n        How to convert base10 integer n to base b (integer base)?\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            Then reverse digits and map each digit to a character.\n\n        But note: the problem says to omit leading zeros, so if n==0, then output \"0\".\n\n        However, the problem says the input number is non-negative and can be zero? But for Roman, the number is guaranteed not to be zero. For other cases, the input is non-negative and the decimal value is at most 101510 (which is positive, but the input string could be \"0\" in base a?).\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"non-negative integer c in base a\", so zero is allowed. However, for Roman: \"it won't be 0\", so if we get a zero in the Roman case, then we don't have to handle it. But the input condition for Roman says the number is not zero. For the other cases, zero is allowed.\n\n        However, note: the base conversion from base a to base10: if the string is \"0\", then the base10 integer is 0.\n\n        Then for the other case (base b), we must output \"0\".\n\n        But the problem says: \"omit leading zeros\", so if the number is zero, we output \"0\".\n\n        However, the example inputs do not include zero.\n\n        Steps for base10 to base b (integer base):\n\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            Then, we need to map each digit to a character: \n                if r < 10: use str(r)\n                else: use chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n            Then reverse the digits and output.\n\n        Example: n=10, base=13: \n            n=10, divmod(10,13) -> (0,10) -> digits=[10]\n            Then map: 10 -> 'A'\n\n        Example: n=1, base=2:\n            n=1, divmod(1,2) -> (0,1) -> digits=[1] -> maps to '1'\n\n        Example: n=10, base=16: \n            n=10, divmod(10,16) -> (0,10) -> 'A'\n\n        Example: n=15, base=16: \n            n=15, divmod(15,16) -> (0,15) -> 'F'\n\n        Example: n=16, base=16:\n            n=16, divmod(16,16) -> (1,0), then n=1: divmod(1,16) -> (0,1)\n            digits = [0,1] -> reverse to [1,0] -> so output '10'\n\n        But wait: 16 in base16 should be \"10\", which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\": \n            First, convert \"1111001\" from base2 to base10: \n                This is 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^0)\n                = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121\n\n            Then convert 121 to base2: \n                121 //2 = 60 remainder 1\n                60//2=30 r0\n                30//2=15 r0\n                15//2=7 r1\n                7//2=3 r1\n                3//2=1 r1\n                1//2=0 r1\n                So digits (from last to first): 1111001 -> same as input.\n\n        But wait, we are converting from base2 to base2: so we must get the same. However, the example output is \"1111001\". \n\n        However, note: the input string is \"1111001\", and we are converting from base2 to base10: \n            We can compute: \n                Start from the left: \n                n = 0\n                for char in \"1111001\":\n                    d = 1 (if char=='1')\n                    n = n*2 + d\n\n            This gives: \n                n = 0\n                n = 0*2+1 = 1\n                n = 1*2+1 = 3\n                n = 3*2+1 = 7\n                n = 7*2+1 = 15\n                n = 15*2+0 = 30\n                n = 30*2+0 = 60\n                n = 60*2+1 = 121\n\n        Then converting 121 back to base2: \n            We get: \n                121 -> 1, remainder 120 -> 60 -> 0, 30->0, 15->1, 7->1, 3->1, 1->1\n                So the digits (from least significant to most) are: 1,0,0,1,1,1,1 -> reversed: 1111001.\n\n        So the algorithm for base a to base10:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in s:\n                d = int(char) if char in '0123456789' else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is less than or equal to 10? Then the input string might contain letters? \n\n        According to the problem: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n        So if base a is 11, then the digits can be from 0 to 10. The digit 'A' is used for 10.\n\n        However, if base a is 11, then the digit 'A' is allowed and represents 10. But if base a is 10, then the digits are from 0 to 9, so no letters.\n\n        So the conversion function for a digit char:\n\n            def char_to_digit(c):\n                if '0' <= c <= '9':\n                    return int(c)\n                else:\n                    return ord(c) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        But note: the input string might contain uppercase letters (since the examples are in uppercase). The problem does not specify case, but the example uses uppercase.\n\n        Also, note: the base a is at least 2, so if base a is 2, then digits can be only 0 and 1. The input string should only contain '0' and '1'.\n\n        However, the problem says: the input string is given in base a and may contain leading zeros. So we assume the input string is valid.\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 16 and the input string contains a letter that is not in the range of base a? For example, base16, then the digits must be from 0 to 15. So the letters 'G' (which is 6) would be invalid? But the problem states the input is valid.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   tokens = input().split()\n   a_str, b_str = tokens[0], tokens[1]\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   if b_str == 'R':\n        # Convert s from base a to base10\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            d = char_to_digit(char)\n            n = n * base_a + d\n\n        # Now convert n to Roman\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n\n        roman_str = ''\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while n >= value:\n                roman_str += symbol\n                n -= value\n        print(roman_str)\n\n   else:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n\n        # Convert s from base a to base10\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            d = char_to_digit(char)\n            n = n * base_a + d\n\n        # Now convert n to base_b\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            # Map each digit to a character\n            for i in range(len(digits)):\n                d = digits.pop()   # pop from the end (so we reverse)\n                if d < 10:\n                    digits[i] = str(d)\n                else:\n                    digits[i] = chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n            # But wait, we built the digits in reverse order (least significant first).

Let me rewrite the else branch:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                print(\"0\")\n            else:\n                digits = []\n                num = n\n                while num:\n                    num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n                    digits.append(r)\n                # Now digits are in reverse order (least significant first).

However, note: the input string is \"1111001\", and we are converting from base2 to base2. We must output the same without leading zeros. The input string has no leading zeros, so we output the same.\n\n   However, what if the input string has leading zeros? \n        Example: base2, base2, input string \"001111001\"\n\n        Then the base10 value is still 121 (because leading zeros don't change the value). Then we convert 121 to base2 and get \"1111001\", so we output \"1111001\".\n\n        But the problem says: \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n        So we are indeed omitting leading zeros.\n\n   But note: the base conversion from base a to base10: we are using the entire string. The leading zeros do not affect the value.\n\n   However, the base conversion algorithm for base10 is independent of leading zeros.\n\n   One more edge: base conversion for base_b: if base_b is 1? But the problem says base b is between 2 and 25, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let me test with base_b=1: not possible.\n\n   Another edge: base_b=16, and n=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n   But note: the problem says the input number is non-negative, so we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input number for Roman is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero, so we don't have to handle zero in the Roman case.\n\n   But wait: what if the base_a is 1? The problem says a>=2.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Now, the helper function for char_to_digit:\n\n        We can define:\n\n        def char_to_digit(c):\n            if '0' <= c <= '9':\n                return int(c)\n            else:\n                return ord(c) - ord('A') + 10\n\n   But note: the input string might have lowercase? The problem says the example uses uppercase. The problem statement says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   However, the problem does not specify case. But the example inputs are in uppercase.\n\n   To be safe, we can convert the input string to uppercase? Or the problem guarantees uppercase?\n\n   Since the problem says the input string is given in base a and the digits are represented by either digits or uppercase letters (as per the example), we assume uppercase.\n\n   But what if the input has lowercase? The problem says \"some really odd sign which looks like R\", but for the base part, the second token is either an integer or 'R'. The digits in the string are given in base a, and the problem says for base>10 we use A, B, etc. (uppercase).\n\n   Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we can convert the entire string to uppercase.\n\n   However, note: the example input is provided exactly as in the example. The problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\".\n\n   And the example inputs are in uppercase.\n\n   But the problem does not explicitly say that the input digits are in uppercase. However, the problem also says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   So we can assume that the input string uses uppercase letters for digits above 9.\n\n   But the problem says: \"You can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\", which doesn't specify case, but the example outputs are in uppercase.\n\n   Since the problem examples are in uppercase, and the constraints say the base a is at most 25, we assume the input digits are either digits (0-9) or uppercase letters from 'A' to the letter representing base a-1.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can convert the input string to uppercase.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might give lowercase? \n\n   Let's read the problem: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\"\n\n   It doesn't specify case. \n\n   We can do:\n\n        s = input().strip().upper()\n\n   But wait, what if the base a is 11 and the digit is 'a'? Then we want to interpret 'a' as 10. But if we convert to uppercase, then 'a' becomes 'A', which is correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        We are reading the string and then processing each character",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, possibly including Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting the base 10 number to the desired target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and the target base (b), which could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The next line contains the number (c) in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number (c) from the source base (a) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its decimal value, and accumulating the total value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to symbols, handling subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4).\n4. **Base Conversion to Target Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base 10 integer to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n5. **Output Handling**: Ensure leading zeros are omitted in the output. Special cases (like zero input) are handled separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    s = data[1].strip()\n    s = s.upper()\n    \n    def char_to_digit(c):\n        if '0' <= c <= '9':\n            return int(c)\n        else:\n            return ord(c) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    n = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = char_to_digit(char)\n        n = n * base_a + d\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        roman_str = ''\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while n >= value:\n                roman_str += symbol\n                n -= value\n        print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num = n\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n            digits.reverse()\n            res = []\n            for d in digits:\n                if d < 10:\n                    res.append(str(d))\n                else:\n                    res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n            print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the first line to get the source base (a) and target base (b). The second line is the number (c) to be converted, which is converted to uppercase to handle any lowercase letters uniformly.\n2. **Character to Digit Conversion**: The function `char_to_digit` converts each character in the input string to its numerical value. For digits 0-9, it returns the integer value; for letters (A-Z), it returns the corresponding value starting from 10 for 'A'.\n3. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The loop processes each character of the input string, converting it to its digit value and accumulating the total value in base 10.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the program uses a list of tuples mapping Roman numeral symbols to their respective values. It iteratively subtracts the largest possible values from the base 10 number, appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.\n5. **Base Conversion to Integer Target**: For an integer target base, the program repeatedly divides the base 10 number by the target base, collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to digits (using letters for values 10-25), and the digits are reversed to form the correct order.\n6. **Output**: The final result is printed, ensuring no leading zeros are present. Special handling ensures zero inputs are correctly represented as \"0\". \n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified cases, including large numbers (up to 101510 for non-Roman conversions) and ensures correctness through systematic base conversion and Roman numeral mapping.",
