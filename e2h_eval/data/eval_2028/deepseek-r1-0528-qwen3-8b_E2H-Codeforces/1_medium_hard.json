    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners we double-counted? Actually, the border of an a x b grid has 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, wait: the example input '3 3 1' gives 8. \n        For a 3x3 grid: \n          The border: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n But then for the next ring (if any) we consider the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n How do we compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the i-th ring is the border of the n_i x m_i rectangle.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the entire rectangle's border, but only the border of that inner rectangle. But wait, the description says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\", meaning that we take the entire border of the inner rectangle.\n\n So the i-th ring has:\n   If the inner rectangle is at least 1x1 (which it is, because we are told k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)), then the border of an a x b rectangle (a>=2, b>=2) is 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But what if the inner rectangle is 1x1? Then the border is just the single cell? Actually, the problem states that the ring has width 1. So for a 1x1, the border is 1 cell? However, note the condition: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n However, let's see: \n   The first ring: i=1, then the inner rectangle is w x h. The border is 2*w+2*h-4.\n\n   The second ring: i=2, then the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). The border is 2*(w-4) + 2*(h-4) - 4.\n\n But wait, the example input '7 9 2' gives 40.\n\n   First ring: i=1 -> 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28.\n   Second ring: i=2 -> inner rectangle is (7-4)=3, (9-4)=5 -> 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12.\n   Total = 28 + 12 = 40.\n\n So the total number of cells is the sum for i from 1 to k of [2*(w-4*(i-1)) + 2*(h-4*(i-1)) - 4].\n\n However, let's check the example '3 3 1': \n        i=1: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n But wait, there's another way: sometimes people might think of the ring as the outer layer, then the next ring as the next outer layer. And indeed, each ring is the border of the current rectangle.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away. This matches our calculation.\n\n But what if the inner rectangle becomes too small? The problem states that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the i-th ring has: 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4.\n\n Then total_gilded = sum_{i=1}^{k} (2*(w - 4*(i-1)) + 2*(h - 4*(i-1)) - 4)\n\n But we can simplify:\n\n   = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4]\n   = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*w + 2*h - 8*i - 4]\n\n   = k*(2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8 * (0 + 1 + ... + (k-1))\n\n   = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * ( (k-1)*k//2 )\n\n   = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n However, let's verify with the examples.\n\n Example 1: w=3, h=3, k=1\n   = 1*(2*3+2*3-4) - 4*1*0 = 1*(6+6-4) = 8 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: w=7, h=9, k=1\n   = 1*(14+18-4) = 28 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: w=7, h=9, k=2\n   = 2*(14+18-4) - 4*2*1 = 2*28 - 8 = 56-8 = 48 -> but expected is 40.\n\n Wait, what? That doesn't match. So let me recompute:\n\n   In the expanded form:\n\n      i=0: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 28\n      i=1: 2*(7-4) + 2*(9-4) - 4 = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4=12\n\n   Then total = 28+12=40.\n\n   In the formula: \n        k*(2*w+2*h-4) = 2*(2*7+2*9-4) = 2*(14+18-4)=2*28=56\n        Then subtract 8 * (sum of i from 0 to k-1) but wait, in the expansion we had:\n\n        We wrote: 2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4 = 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*i.\n\n        Then the sum over i from 0 to k-1 is: \n            = (2*w+2*h-4)*k - 8 * (0+1+...+(k-1))\n\n        And the sum of 0 to k-1 is (k-1)*k//2.\n\n        So the formula is: (2*w+2*h-4)*k - 8 * (k*(k-1)//2) = (2*w+2*h-4)*k - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        For k=2: 28*2 - 4*2*1 = 56 - 8 = 48, but expected is 40.\n\n What went wrong?\n\n Let's look again at the expansion:\n\n   For i=0: 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*0 = 28\n   For i=1: 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*1 = 28 - 8 = 20, which is not 12.\n\n Why did we get 20 for i=1?\n\n   Actually, the term for i=1 is: 2*(w-4*1) + 2*(h-4*1) - 4 = 2*(7-4) + 2*(9-4) - 4 = 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12.\n\n   But according to the expression: 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*i = 28 - 8*i.\n\n   For i=1: 28-8=20, but 20 != 12.\n\n So the mistake is: the expression we broke down was:\n\n        2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4 = 2*w - 8*i + 2*h - 8*i - 4 = 2*w+2*h-4 - 16*i.\n\n Wait, no: \n\n        2*(w-4*i) = 2*w - 8*i\n        2*(h-4*i) = 2*h - 8*i\n\n        Then together: 2*w+2*h - 16*i - 4.\n\n So the correct expression is:\n\n        For the i-th ring (with i starting at 0 for the first ring) is: 2*w+2*h - 4 - 16*i.\n\n Then the total becomes:\n\n        Sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*w+2*h-4 - 16*i] \n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (0+1+...+(k-1))\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n Now check with k=2: 2*(28) - 8*2*1 = 56 - 16 = 40. Correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            # But wait, the problem defines the i-th ring (starting at i=1) as the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)).\n            # So for the i-th ring (i from 1 to k) we use (w-4*(i-1)) and (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n        Actually, in our loop above we used i from 0 to k-1, and we set a = w-4*i, but that corresponds to the ring index i (0-indexed) meaning the i-th ring (if we start counting rings from 0) would be the (i+1)-th ring.\n\n        But note: the first ring is when i=0: \n            a = w - 0 = w, b = h, so the border is 2*w+2*h-4.\n\n        The second ring (i=1): \n            a = w-4, b = h-4, so border is 2*(w-4)+2*(h-4)-4.\n\n        This matches.\n\n So the code can be written in two ways:\n\n   Option 1: using a loop\n\n   Option 2: using the closed form: total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But wait, let me verify with k=1: \n        total = 1*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*1*0 = 2*w+2*h-4, which is correct.\n\n Another example: k=3, w=11, h=11 (so min(w,h)=11, then k_max = floor((11+1)/4)=floor(12/4)=3)\n\n   First ring (i=0): 2*11+2*11-4 = 44-4=40\n   Second ring (i=1): 2*(11-4)+2*(11-4)-4 = 2*7+2*7-4 = 14+14-4=24\n   Third ring (i=2): 2*(11-8)+2*(11-8)-4 = 2*3+2*3-4=6+6-4=8\n   Total = 40+24+8 = 72.\n\n   Closed form: 3*(44-4) - 8*3*2 = 3*40 - 48 = 120-48=72.\n\n Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n However, note: the problem states that k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). We must ensure that we are not calculating beyond the plate.\n\n Since the problem constraints say k is within the valid range, we don't need to check for negative or zero.\n\n But note: the formula uses the entire k rings. \n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read w, h, k from stdin.\n\n   total = k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8 * k * (k-1)\n\n   Print total.\n\n However, wait: the above formula is derived from:\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n   But note: the expression 8*k*(k-1) is the same as 8 * (k*(k-1)).\n\n But let me break down the derivation:\n\n        We have for the i-th ring (0-indexed i from 0 to k-1):\n\n            ring_i = 2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4\n                   = 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*i   [because 4*i*2 = 8*i]\n\n        Then the total is the sum for i=0 to k-1:\n\n            = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))\n\n            = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (k*(k-1)//2)   [since the sum of the first k-1 natural numbers is k*(k-1)//2]\n\n            But note: the sum from 0 to k-1 is k*(k-1)//2? Actually, the sum from 0 to k-1 is (k-1)*k//2.\n\n            So: total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n\n            But note: 8 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        So yes, total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        However, wait: \n\n            We had: 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*i for the i-th term.\n\n            Then the total is: \n                = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*(0+1+...+(k-1))\n\n            The sum of 0 to k-1 is (k-1)*k//2.\n\n            So total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * ((k-1)*k//2)\n\n            But 8 * ((k-1)*k//2) = 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        Therefore, the formula is: total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        And we verified with k=2: 2*(28) - 4*2*1 = 56-8=48 -> wait, that was incorrect.\n\n        Let me recalc without integer division: \n\n            In the expansion we said:\n\n                ring_i = 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*i\n\n            Then the total is the sum of k terms: \n\n                = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i)\n\n            The sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = (k-1)*k//2.\n\n            Then total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * ( (k-1)*k//2 )\n\n            But note: 8 * ( (k-1)*k//2 ) = 4 * k * (k-1)   [if (k-1)*k is even, but in integer arithmetic we use floor division? Actually, since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even so (k-1)*k is divisible by 2.]\n\n            Then for k=2: 8 * ( (2-1)*2//2 ) = 8 * ( (1*2)//2 ) = 8 * (2//2) = 8*1 = 8.\n\n            Then total = 2*28 - 8 = 56-8=48.\n\n        But wait, we know the second ring is 12, so 28+12=40, not 48.\n\n        Why the discrepancy?\n\n        Let me check the expansion again:\n\n            For i=0: term0 = 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*0 = 28.\n            For i=1: term1 = 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*1 = 28-8=20.\n\n            But the actual second ring is 12, not 20.\n\n        So the expansion was wrong.\n\n        Let me re-expand:\n\n            ring_i = 2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4\n                   = 2*w - 8*i + 2*h - 8*i - 4\n                   = 2*w+2*h-4 - 16*i   [because 8*i+8*i=16*i]\n\n        Ah, here is the error! \n\n            We have: 2*(w-4*i) = 2*w - 8*i\n                     2*(h-4*i) = 2*h - 8*i\n            Then adding: 2*w+2*h - 16*i - 4.\n\n        So the correct expansion is: 2*w+2*h-4 - 16*i.\n\n        Then the total becomes:\n\n            = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i)\n\n            = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * ( (k-1)*k//2 )\n\n            = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n        Now check k=2: 2*(28) - 8*2*1 = 56 - 16 = 40.\n\n        Check k=1: 1*(28) - 8*1*0 = 28.\n\n        Check k=3 (w=11, h=11): \n            Each ring: \n                i=0: 2*11+2*11-4 - 16*0 = 44-4=40\n                i=1: 44-4-16=24\n                i=2: 44-4-32=8\n                total=40+24+8=72.\n\n            Closed form: 3*(44-4) - 8*3*2 = 3*40 - 48 = 120-48=72.\n\n        So the correct formula is:\n\n            total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n        But wait, we have two different expansions. \n\n        Alternatively, we can also derive without breaking into i:\n\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                a = w - 4*i\n                b = h - 4*i\n                # But note: the i-th ring (0-indexed) corresponds to the (i+1)-th ring in the problem's order, and the problem says the i-th ring (starting at 1) is defined by (w-4*(i-1)) and (h-4*(i-1)). \n                # So actually, we should use i from 0 to k-1, and the rectangle for the i-th ring (0-indexed) is (w-4*i) x (h-4*i). \n\n                # However, the problem's first ring (i=1) uses (w-4*(1-1)) = w, so we are consistent.\n\n                # But note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away, so we subtract 4 (which is 2*2) for each step. So our use of 4*i is correct.\n\n                # The border of an a x b grid (with a>=1, b>=1) is: \n                #   If a==1 and b==1: 1\n                #   Otherwise, the border is 2*a+2*b-4, but this formula only works for a>=2 and b>=2. \n\n                # However, the problem states k is such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1 (but we are guaranteed that the dimensions are positive and the rings are defined until the inner rectangle becomes too small).\n\n                # But note: the problem says the ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)). This inner rectangle must have at least 1 row and 1 column. However, the border formula 2*a+2*b-4 requires that the rectangle has at least 2 rows and 2 columns to subtract 4. \n\n                # Actually, for a 1x1 rectangle, the border is 1 (just the cell). But the formula 2*1+2*1-4 = 2+2-4=0, which is incorrect.\n\n                # But the problem constraints say that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n                # Let me check: for w=h=3, k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So for k=1, we use 3x3 -> 8, which is correct.\n\n                # For w=h=5, k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one. The key insight is recognizing that each ring's cell count can be derived from the dimensions of the inner rectangle it bounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward from the edge, and so on. Each ring's cell count depends on the dimensions of the inner rectangle it forms.\n2. **Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells can be computed using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle minus the corners (since they are counted twice). Specifically, for an inner rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\), the number of cells in its border is \\(2a + 2b - 4\\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves summing the cell counts for each of the \\(k\\) rings. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the \\(i\\)-th ring are \\((w - 4(i-1)) \\times (h - 4(i-1))\\). The total cells are the sum of these values for all \\(k\\) rings.\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of iterating through each ring, we use a mathematical formula to compute the total cells directly. The formula is derived by recognizing that each subsequent ring's cell count decreases linearly with the ring index. The total cells can be calculated as \\(k \\times (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 \\times k \\times (k - 1)\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads three integers \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Formula Application**: The total number of gilded cells is computed using the derived formula \\(k \\times (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 \\times k \\times (k - 1)\\). This formula efficiently sums the cells of all \\(k\\) rings by leveraging the observation that each ring's cell count decreases linearly with the ring index.\n3. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the total number of cells to be gilded across all specified rings.\n\nThis approach ensures optimal performance with constant time complexity \\(O(1)\\), making it suitable for large inputs within the given constraints.",
