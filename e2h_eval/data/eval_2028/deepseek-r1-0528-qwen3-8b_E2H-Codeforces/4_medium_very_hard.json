The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are repeated cyclically. Let:\n   m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n In one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., when we have gone through a common multiple of m and k rounds?),\n but actually we don't need a common multiple for the entire game because we are going to break the n rounds into:\n\n However, note: The two sequences cycle independently. In round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n We are to count the number of rounds where:\n   - Nikephoros loses: meaning the outcome is such that Polycarpus wins.\n   - Polycarpus loses: meaning the outcome is such that Nikephoros wins.\n\n There are three outcomes per round (ignoring draw):\n   Draw: same item -> no loss.\n   Win: \n        Rock beats Scissors -> if A_i is 'R' and B_i is 'S', then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n        Scissors beats Paper -> if A_i is 'S' and B_i is 'P', then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n        Paper beats Rock -> if A_i is 'P' and B_i is 'R', then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n\n Similarly, from Polycarpus's perspective:\n        If B_i is 'R' and A_i is 'S', then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses).\n        If B_i is 'S' and A_i is 'P', then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses).\n        If B_i is 'P' and A_i is 'R', then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses).\n\n Alternatively, we can say:\n   Loss for Nikephoros (i.e., Polycarpus wins) when:\n        (A_i, B_i) is ('S','P'), ('P','R'), ('R','S')? Wait, let me check:\n\n Actually, according to the rules:\n   Rock beats scissors -> so if Nikephoros shows 'R' and Polycarpus shows 'S', then Nikephoros wins.\n   So if we want the cases where Nikephoros loses, that would be:\n        When Polycarpus wins: \n            Polycarpus shows 'R' and Nikephoros shows 'S'\n            Polycarpus shows 'S' and Nikephoros shows 'P'\n            Polycarpus shows 'P' and Nikephoros shows 'R'\n\n Similarly, for Polycarpus to lose (Nikephoros wins):\n        Nikephoros shows 'R' and Polycarpus shows 'S'\n        Nikephoros shows 'S' and Polycarpus shows 'P'\n        Nikephoros shows 'P' and Polycarpus shows 'R'\n\n But wait, that is exactly the same set of conditions for a win for one and a loss for the other? \n Actually, note that the condition for a win for Nikephoros is the same as the condition for a loss for Polycarpus?\n\n Let me clarify with examples:\n\n Condition for Nikephoros to win (Polycarpus loses):\n   (A_i, B_i) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n Condition for Polycarpus to win (Nikephoros loses):\n   (A_i, B_i) in [('S','P'), ('P','R'), ('R','S')] -> wait, that's the same set! \n\n Actually, no. Let me write it again:\n\n Standard rules:\n   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S): so (R, S) -> R wins.\n   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P): so (S, P) -> S wins.\n   Paper (P) beats Rock (R): so (P, R) -> P wins.\n\n So, the outcomes are:\n\n   (R, R): Draw\n   (R, S): R wins (so Polycarpus loses)\n   (R, P): P wins (so Polycarpus wins)\n\n   (S, R): S loses? Actually, R beats S -> so (S, R): R wins (which is Polycarpus wins) -> so (S, R) is a win for Polycarpus (thus loss for Nikephoros)\n   (S, S): Draw\n   (S, P): S wins (so Polycarpus loses) -> wait, no: in (S, P): S is shown by Nikephoros and P by Polycarpus. Then S beats P -> so Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n\n   (P, R): P beats R -> Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n   (P, S): P loses to S -> Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n   (P, P): Draw\n\n So, to summarize:\n\n   Outcome for round i:\n     Draw: A_i == B_i.\n\n     Otherwise, we have:\n        If (A_i, B_i) is ('R','S') OR ('S','P') OR ('P','R'): then Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses).\n        If (A_i, B_i) is ('S','R') OR ('P','S') OR ('R','P'): then Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses).\n\n Therefore, we can define:\n\n   loss_Nikephoros = number of rounds where (A_i, B_i) is in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]\n   loss_Polycarpus = number of rounds where (A_i, B_i) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n However, note: the two sets are disjoint and together they cover all non-draws.\n\n But wait, let's check the sets:\n\n   Condition for Nikephoros win: (R,S), (S,P), (P,R) -> that's three.\n   Condition for Polycarpus win: (S,R), (P,S), (R,P) -> that's three.\n\n And indeed, there are 3*3=9 possible pairs, minus 3 draws (when the two letters are same) leaves 6, and 3+3=6.\n\n Now, how to count over n rounds?\n\n We note that the rounds are determined by two independent cycles: one of length m (for A) and one of length k (for B).\n\n We can consider the rounds modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k? But note: we are not required to have a common cycle for both, but we can break the n rounds into cycles of length LCM(m,k). However, since n can be very large (up to 2e9) and m,k up to 1000, the LCM might be too large to iterate over.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the pattern of (A_i, B_i) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds. But LCM(m,k) can be as large as m*k (if coprime) which is 1e6, and 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000 cycles, which is acceptable if we precompute one cycle and then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then handle the remainder.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total losses for one full cycle (of length L = LCM(m,k))? Actually, we can use the fact that the pattern repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds, but note: we have two independent cycles. However, we can also think: \n\n    The entire sequence of (A_i, B_i) for i from 0 to n-1 is periodic with period L = LCM(m, k). \n\n    How to compute L? \n        L = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n    But note: n can be up to 2e9 and m,k up to 1000, so L can be up to 1e6 (since gcd(m,k) is at least 1, so L <= m*k <= 1e6). That's acceptable.\n\n 2. However, we don't necessarily need to use LCM(m,k). We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n    We can consider the entire sequence of (A_i, B_i) as being built by two independent cycles. We can break the n rounds into:\n\n        total_rounds = n\n\n        We can simulate the first L rounds (where L = LCM(m,k)) and then for the remaining rounds, we can use the precomputed pattern for the remainder.\n\n    But note: the two cycles are independent and the pair (i mod m, j mod k) for i from 0 to L-1 will cover every combination of residues exactly once? \n\n    Actually, the sequence of pairs (i mod m, j mod k) for i from 0 to L-1 (with L = LCM(m,k)) will cover every pair (x,y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] exactly once? \n\n    Yes, because the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both m and k, so when i runs from 0 to L-1, the indices for A repeat m times (each residue appears L/m times) and for B repeat k times (each residue appears L/k times). Moreover, the pair (i mod m, j mod k) will form a complete residue system over the direct product of Z_m and Z_k.\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Let L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        Precompute an array for one full cycle (L rounds) of the losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n        Then, the number of full cycles in n rounds is: cycles = n // L\n        The remainder = n % L\n\n        Then, the total losses for Nikephoros = cycles * (loss_Nikephoros_in_one_cycle) + (loss_Nikephoros in the first remainder rounds)\n        Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n 3. But note: the LCM might be large (up to 1e6) and n is up to 2e9, but 2e9 is about 2000 * 1e6, so we can simulate one cycle (which has L up to 1e6) and then do simple arithmetic.\n\n However, 1e6 is acceptable in terms of memory and time for a single pass (since 1e6 is 1000000, which is acceptable in Python if we do it once).\n\n Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n\n    Step 2: Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n    Step 3: Compute L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n    Step 4: Precompute for i in range(0, L): \n        a_index = i % m\n        b_index = i % k\n        Check the outcome for (A[a_index], B[b_index])\n\n        Count:\n            If (A[a_index], B[b_index]) is ('S','R') or ('P','S') or ('R','P'):\n                This is a loss for Nikephoros (and a win for Polycarpus) -> so add one to loss_Nikephoros_count and one to loss_Polycarpus_count? \n                Actually, no: we are counting losses. In this case, if (A, B) is ('S','R'): then Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses) -> so this round adds 1 to Nikephoros's loss.\n                Similarly, if (A, B) is ('P','S'): then Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's loss.\n                And if (A, B) is ('R','P'): then Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's loss.\n\n            But wait, we also have the other three outcomes that are wins for Nikephoros and losses for Polycarpus.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define two counters for the entire cycle:\n\n            loss_Nike = 0\n            loss_Poly = 0\n\n            For each round i in [0, L-1]:\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n\n                if (a_char, b_char) == ('R','R') or ('S','S') or ('P','P'):\n                    # draw, do nothing\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    # Nikephoros wins -> so Polycarpus loses: add one to loss_Poly\n                    loss_Poly += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    # Polycarpus wins -> so Nikephoros loses: add one to loss_Nike\n                    loss_Nike += 1\n\n        Then, the counts for the entire game:\n\n            full_cycles = n // L\n            remainder = n % L\n\n            total_loss_Nike = full_cycles * loss_Nike + (number of losses for Nikephoros in the first remainder rounds)\n            total_loss_Poly = full_cycles * loss_Poly + (number of losses for Polycarpus in the first remainder rounds)\n\n    Step 5: Print total_loss_Nike and total_loss_Poly.\n\n However, note: we have two separate counters: one for the losses of Nikephoros and one for the losses of Polycarpus.\n\n But wait, in the above simulation for one cycle, we are counting:\n\n   loss_Nike: the number of rounds in the cycle where (A,B) is one of [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]\n   loss_Poly: the number of rounds in the cycle where (A,B) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n Then, the above code for one cycle is correct.\n\n But note: the example input:\n\n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Expected: 3 2\n\n        Let's break down the 7 rounds:\n\n        Round 0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw -> nothing\n        Round 1: A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> (P, S): P loses to S -> so Polycarpus wins -> loss_Nike += 1\n        Round 2: A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> (S, P): S wins -> loss_Poly += 1\n        Round 3: A[0%3='R'], B[3%4='P'] -> (R, P): R loses to P -> loss_Nike += 1\n        Round 4: A[1%3='P'], B[4%4='R'] -> (P, R): P wins -> loss_Poly += 1\n        Round 5: A[2%3='S'], B[5%4='S'] -> (S, S): draw -> nothing\n        Round 6: A[0%3='R'], B[6%4='P'] -> (R, P): R loses to P -> loss_Nike += 1\n\n        So: \n            loss_Nike = 3 (rounds 1, 3, 6)\n            loss_Poly = 2 (rounds 2, 4)\n\n        This matches the expected output.\n\n    However, note that in our simulation for the cycle, we must simulate 7 rounds, but the cycle length L = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n    We cannot simulate 12 rounds for the example because n=7 is less than 12. But our method is to break the 7 rounds into one full cycle (which is 12) doesn't fit. \n\n    Actually, we are breaking the n rounds (7) into:\n        full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0\n        remainder = 7\n\n    Then we only need to simulate the first 7 rounds to get the counts for the remainder.\n\n    But wait, we computed the cycle of length 12, and we are going to use the entire cycle (12 rounds) for the full cycle part. However, we don't have 12 rounds in the example. \n\n    Correction: We should consider that the cycle is 12 rounds, but we are only playing 7 rounds. So we cannot use the entire cycle's counts for the full_cycles part because full_cycles is 0.\n\n    Then we just simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\n    However, the problem is that we defined the cycle as LCM(m,k) and then we break n into n = full_cycles * L + remainder, and then we use the counts from one cycle (the first L rounds) for the full_cycles part.\n\n    But what if we don't know the entire cycle? We must compute the counts for the first L rounds (the cycle) and then use that for the full_cycles.\n\n    The issue in the example: we are asked for 7 rounds. The cycle is 12 rounds, so we don't have any full cycle. Then we only need the first 7 rounds.\n\n    However, our simulation for the cycle is for 12 rounds, but we don't need to simulate 12 rounds for the example. We can simulate the entire n rounds without using LCM? \n\n    Alternative approach:\n\n        We can simulate the entire n rounds by iterating over the rounds? But n can be up to 2e9 -> that is too many.\n\n    Therefore, we must use the cycle.\n\n    But note: the cycle is LCM(m,k) which is 12 in the example, and 12 is less than 2e9. However, we are storing counts for one cycle (12 rounds) and then we break n into full_cycles and remainder.\n\n    However, 12 is small, so we can compute the cycle.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, A, B.\n\n        Step 2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n        Step 3: Compute g = gcd(m, k); L = (m * k) // g\n\n        Step 4: Precompute the counts for one cycle (L rounds) by iterating i from 0 to L-1.\n\n        Step 5: full_cycles = n // L\n                remainder = n % L\n\n        Step 6: total_loss_Nike = full_cycles * (count of [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] in one cycle) + (count of [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] in the first remainder rounds)\n\n        Similarly for total_loss_Poly.\n\n        But wait, in the one cycle we have two counters: one for the losses of Nikephoros and one for the losses of Polycarpus.\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            loss_Nike_cycle = 0\n            loss_Poly_cycle = 0\n            for i in range(L):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    loss_Poly_cycle += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    loss_Nike_cycle += 1\n\n            Then, we need to compute the counts for the first 'remainder' rounds separately.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            loss_Nike_rem = 0\n            loss_Poly_rem = 0\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    loss_Poly_rem += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    loss_Nike_rem += 1\n\n            Then, total_loss_Nike = full_cycles * loss_Nike_cycle + loss_Nike_rem\n            total_loss_Poly = full_cycles * loss_Poly_cycle + loss_Poly_rem\n\n        Then print(total_loss_Nike, total_loss_Poly)\n\n    However, note: the above two loops (one for the entire cycle and one for the remainder) are necessary. The cycle simulation is O(L) and the remainder simulation is O(remainder). Since L can be up to 1e6 and remainder is at most L-1 (which is 1e6-1) and n is 2e9, then the remainder is at most 1e6-1, so the second loop is acceptable.\n\n    But wait, is L = LCM(m,k) always <= 1000*1000? Yes, because m,k<=1000, and LCM(m,k) <= m*k <= 1e6.\n\n    However, 1e6 iterations for the cycle and 1e6 for the remainder: worst-case we do 2e6 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n    But note: we are reading n which can be up to 2e9, but we are not iterating n times, we are iterating at most 2e6 (which is 2 million) which is acceptable.\n\n    However, we can avoid two separate loops by simulating the entire cycle and then storing the cumulative counts for each index in the cycle.\n\n    Alternatively, we can combine the two: we simulate the cycle once and store the counts for each position in the cycle. Then the remainder part is just the sum from 0 to remainder-1.\n\n    But the above is clear and within the constraints.\n\n    Let me test with the example:\n\n        n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4, L = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        We simulate 12 rounds for the cycle? Actually, we only need the first 7 rounds for the remainder. But we are going to simulate 12 rounds for the cycle and 7 rounds for the remainder.\n\n        However, we can note: the remainder is 7, so we don't need the entire cycle. But we have to compute the entire cycle for the full_cycles part (which is 0). \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the counts for the entire cycle (12 rounds) and then use the remainder (7) to take the first 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the cycle is 12 rounds. The 7 rounds are the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            loss_Nike_cycle = 0\n            loss_Poly_cycle = 0\n            for i in range(12):\n                ... compute and update\n\n            Then, for the remainder, we take the first 7 rounds from the same cycle.\n\n        However, we don't need to store the entire cycle's outcomes, only the counts. But we can compute the remainder part by simulating the first 7 rounds independently.\n\n        But note: the cycle is fixed, so the first 7 rounds are the same as the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0\n            remainder = 7\n\n            Then we simulate 7 rounds to get the counts for the remainder.\n\n        Then total_loss_Nike = 0 + (counts from 7 rounds) = 3\n        total_loss_Poly = 0 + (counts from 7 rounds) = 2\n\n        How do we get the counts from 7 rounds? We simulate the 7 rounds:\n\n            i=0: (R,R) -> draw -> no loss\n            i=1: (P,S) -> (P,S): is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no, because (P,S) is not in that list. \n                  Actually, wait: our condition for loss_Poly (Polycarpus loses) is (A,B) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n                  (P,S) is not in that list. Then we check the other condition: [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] -> (P,S) is in [('P','S')] -> yes, so loss_Nike += 1.\n\n            i=2: (S,P) -> (S,P): check [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (S,P) is in [('S','P')] -> yes, so loss_Poly += 1.\n\n            i=3: (R,P) -> (R,P): [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (R,P) is in [('P','R')] no, because 'P' is first and 'R' is second? Actually, the condition is: (A,B) = (R,P). \n                  Our condition for loss_Poly is (A,B) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (R,P) is not there. Then check the other condition: [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] -> (R,P) is ('R','P') -> yes, so loss_Nike += 1.\n\n            i=4: (P,R) -> (P,R): [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (P,R) is in [('P','R')] -> yes, so loss_Poly += 1.\n\n            i=5: (S,S) -> draw.\n\n            i=6: (R,P) -> same as i=3: loss_Nike += 1.\n\n            So in 7 rounds: \n                loss_Nike = 3, loss_Poly = 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n    However, we have to be cautious: the condition for loss_Poly is (A,B) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n        (P,R): A='P', B='R' -> ('P','R') -> this is in the list -> so loss_Poly.\n\n        (R,P): A='R', B='P' -> ('R','P') -> this is not in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] because we have 'P' in the first element? Actually, the list has ('P','R') but not ('R','P').\n\n    So the conditions are:\n\n        loss_Poly: (A,B) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n        loss_Nike: (A,B) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]\n\n    These are distinct and cover all non-draws.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        We'll use:\n            import math\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A = input().strip()\n            B = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A)\n            k = len(B)\n\n            # Compute LCM(m, k)\n            g = math.gcd(m, k)\n            L = (m * k) // g\n\n            # We are going to simulate the entire cycle (L rounds) to get the counts for one full cycle?\n            # But note: we don't need the entire cycle if we are going to break the n rounds into full_cycles and remainder, and then simulate the remainder separately.\n\n            # However, the full_cycles part requires the entire cycle counts.\n\n            # So we do:\n\n            # First, simulate the entire cycle (L rounds) to get:\n            loss_Nike_cycle = 0\n            loss_Poly_cycle = 0\n\n            for i in range(L):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    loss_Poly_cycle += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    loss_Nike_cycle += 1\n\n            full_cycles = n // L\n            remainder = n % L\n\n            # Now, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds to get the counts for the remainder part.\n            loss_Nike_rem = 0\n            loss_Poly_rem = 0\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    loss_Poly_rem += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n                    loss_Nike_rem += 1\n\n            total_Nike = full_cycles * loss_Nike_cycle + loss_Nike_rem\n            total_Poly = full_cycles * loss_Poly_cycle + loss_Poly_rem\n\n            print(total_Nike, total_Poly)\n\n    Let me test with the provided example.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: \n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        First sample: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\" -> output \"3 2\"\n\n        Second sample: \n            Input: 5 rounds, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n\n            m = 8, k = 1\n\n            LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n            Cycle simulation for 8 rounds:\n\n                Round0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw -> no loss\n                Round1: A[1]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw\n                ... all rounds are (R,R) -> no loss.\n\n            So loss_Nike_cycle = 0, loss_Poly_cycle = 0 for the entire cycle.\n\n            n=5, full_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, remainder=5.\n\n            Then we simulate 5 rounds: all (R,R) -> no loss.\n\n            Output: 0 0.\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n    However, note: the example input is given as two separate inputs? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        But in standard input, we have:\n\n            First line: 7\n            Second line: RPS\n            Third line: RSPP\n\n            Then next input set:\n\n            First line: 5\n            Second line: RRRRRRRR\n            Third line: R\n\n        But the code reads sequentially.\n\n    But wait, the example input is given as two strings in a list? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        This is probably a representation of two test cases. But the problem says:\n\n            The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n            The second line contains sequence A ...\n            The third line contains sequence B ...\n\n        So we read three lines for each test case? Or is it one test case?\n\n        The problem does not specify multiple test cases. The example input is given as:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        But the actual input format is: the first integer n, then the string A, then the string B.\n\n        However, the example input is two separate test cases? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input.\n\n        But the example input is given as two separate blocks. \n\n        Clarification: the problem expects one test case per run.\n\n        But the sample input in the problem statement includes two examples. \n\n        Since the problem says \"Input\" and then gives the example, we assume one test case.\n\n        However, the example input is provided as two strings in a list? \n\n        Looking at the example: \n\n            Input: \n                ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n            Output: \n                ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n        This seems to be two separate test cases. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game.\"\n\n        So the input is one integer n and two strings. \n\n        How should we handle multiple test cases? \n\n        The problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n        But the example input is given as two test cases. \n\n        Since the problem constraints say n from 1 to 2e9, and the strings from 1 to 1000, and the example input has two test cases, we must check the input format.\n\n        The problem says: \n            The first line contains integer n\n            The second line contains sequence A\n            The third line contains sequence B\n\n        So we should read three lines.\n\n        But the example input is given as two strings, each containing a mix of numbers and letters. \n\n        Actually, the example input is:\n\n            Line1: \"7\"\n            Line2: \"RPS\"\n            Line3: \"RSPP\"\n\n        and then\n\n            Line1: \"5\"\n            Line2: \"RRRRRRRR\"\n            Line3: \"R\"\n\n        So we should read until EOF.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n        But the example input is two test cases. \n\n        To be safe, we can read until EOF. However, the problem says \"The first line\" etc.\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: it says \"The first line\" and then the second and third. So it's one test case.\n\n        But the example input is provided as two test cases. \n\n        I think the example input is just showing two examples. \n\n        Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        Since the constraints are high and the input format is fixed, we assume one test case.\n\n        But the example input is given as two separate blocks. \n\n        Actually, the example input is:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        This is a representation of two test cases. \n\n        But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. \n\n        In competitive programming, sometimes there are multiple test cases. \n\n        However, the problem does not mention multiple test cases. \n\n        After re‐reading: the input is three lines. \n\n        We must read three lines.\n\n        But the example input is provided as two strings, each containing a mix of numbers and letters. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n\n            Input:\n                The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n                The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters.\n\n        So we read:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A = input().strip()\n            B = input().strip()\n\n        Then process.\n\n        But the example input is given as two separate test cases. \n\n        The problem statement might be including two examples. \n\n        Since the constraints are high and the input format is fixed, we assume one test case.\n\n        However, if there are multiple test cases, we need to read until EOF.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. \n\n        Let me check the sample input: \n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    7\n                    RPS\n                    RSPP\n\n            Example 2:\n                Input:\n                    5\n                    RRRRRRRR\n                    R\n\n        So we must handle one test case.\n\n        But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format.\n\n        We'll write the code for one test case.\n\n        However, note that the problem may have multiple test cases. \n\n        But the constraints say: n from 1 to 2e9, and the strings from 1 to 1000. \n\n        If there are multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF.\n\n        The problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        Since the problem statement example is two separate examples, but the input format is three lines per test case, we can do:\n\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    A = input().strip()\n                    B = input().strip()\n                    # process\n                except EOFError:\n                    break\n\n        But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n        However, looking at the problem statement: it says \"The first line\", meaning the first line of the input. \n\n        Since the problem is from a programming competition, sometimes they give multiple test cases. \n\n        But the constraints and the example input (two examples) suggest that we might have one test case.\n\n        But the example input is given as two separate blocks. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be designed for one test case.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I'll assume one test case.\n\n        But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        This is a list of two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the game can have up to 2 billion rounds, making a brute-force simulation infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to efficiently compute the results.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of rock, paper, or scissors. Each round's outcome depends on the current moves from both sequences. The challenge is to count losses (rounds where a player does not win) over a large number of rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the pattern of outcomes repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds, where m and k are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to break the problem into full cycles and a remaining partial cycle.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: Simulate one full cycle to count losses for both players within that cycle.\n   - **Efficient Calculation**: Use the cycle counts to compute total losses for all full cycles and then simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes one cycle of length LCM(m, k), which is at most 1,000,000 (since m and k are up to 1000). The remaining rounds are processed in linear time relative to the remainder, which is also manageable. Thus, the overall complexity is O(L + r), where L is the cycle length and r is the remainder, making it efficient for large n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n    \n    loss_Nike_cycle = 0\n    loss_Poly_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            loss_Poly_cycle += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n            loss_Nike_cycle += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    loss_Nike_rem = 0\n    loss_Poly_rem = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            loss_Poly_rem += 1\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]:\n            loss_Nike_rem += 1\n            \n    total_loss_Nike = full_cycles * loss_Nike_cycle + loss_Nike_rem\n    total_loss_Poly = full_cycles * loss_Poly_cycle + loss_Poly_rem\n    \n    print(total_loss_Nike, total_loss_Poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds (n), followed by the two sequences (A and B) used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths (m and k) determines the cycle length (L) after which the pattern of outcomes repeats.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each position in the cycle, the algorithm checks the outcome of the round based on the current moves from both sequences. It counts how many times each player loses within one cycle.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles is computed as `n // L`, and the remaining rounds are `n % L`. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the cycle counts, and the remaining rounds are simulated separately.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed, combining losses from full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity and avoids the need for brute-force simulation.",
