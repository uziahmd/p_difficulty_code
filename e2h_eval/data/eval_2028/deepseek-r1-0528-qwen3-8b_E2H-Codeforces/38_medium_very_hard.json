    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two numbers:\n\n 1. The minimum number of nodes required to have a directed graph that is p-reachable (i.e., contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and there is a path from u to v and from v to u). Note: the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs with u < v and mutual reachability\". However, note that in a strongly connected component (SCC), every pair (u, v) with u < v is counted? Actually, the problem states: \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". So we are counting unordered pairs (but ordered by node index) that form a strongly connected component? Actually, note: the entire graph might not be strongly connected.\n\n But note: the definition of p-reachable: the graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability. This means that if we break the graph into strongly connected components (SCCs), then within each SCC the condition holds for every pair (u, v) with u < v. However, the problem does not require that the entire graph is strongly connected.\n\n Important: In a directed graph, if we have multiple SCCs, then the mutual reachability condition only applies within one SCC. Moreover, if there are two distinct SCCs, then there should be no mutual reachability between nodes from different components.\n\n So the total number of mutual reachability pairs (with u < v) is the sum over all SCCs of C(comp_size, 2). Therefore, we are looking for a decomposition of n nodes (with n being the total number of nodes) into k SCCs (each being a set of nodes) such that the sum of C(size_i, 2) for i=1 to k equals p.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have a graph that is not strongly connected? Actually, the problem says \"p-reachable\", meaning the graph has exactly p mutual reachability pairs (with u < v). The graph might have several SCCs.\n\n However, we are to minimize the number of nodes. Also, we are to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (which are defined as (u, v) with u != v, a path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let n = total number of nodes.\n\n We know that the entire graph must have exactly p mutual reachability pairs. These come from the complete strong connectivity within the SCCs.\n\n How can we assign the nodes to SCCs? We want to represent p as the sum of combinations (for each SCC of size s: s*(s-1)//2) and use the minimal total n (which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs).\n\n So we are looking for a set of integers (s1, s2, ..., sk) such that:\n   s1*(s1-1)//2 + s2*(s2-1)//2 + ... + sk*(sk-1)//2 = p\n\n and the total n = s1 + s2 + ... + sk, and we want to minimize n.\n\n Additionally, note that we can also have isolated nodes (SCCs of size 1). For an SCC of size 1, the mutual reachability pairs it contributes is 0.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly p\". So we must have the sum of the combinations equal to p.\n\n Now, note that the problem also requires that the graph is built with the minimal number of nodes. Then, among all graphs with that minimal number of nodes, we must choose one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n How do we compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs?\n\n Observation: \n   In a directed graph, the total possible ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). \n   The graph may have edges. The unidirectional pairs are those (u, v) (u != v) for which there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n However, note that the graph must be p-reachable. So we must arrange the graph so that the mutual reachability is exactly p. \n\n But note: the graph structure can be broken down into SCCs. We can assume that the graph is built on a set of SCCs and that the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs) is acyclic. Then, within each SCC, the graph is strongly connected (so for every two distinct nodes u and v in the same SCC, both (u->v) and (v->u) are considered, but note: we don't require direct edges, just paths). \n\n The unidirectional pairs can occur in two ways:\n   1. Between two different SCCs: if there is an edge from an SCC A to an SCC B (and no back edge from B to A) then for every node u in A and every node v in B, the pair (u, v) is unidirectional (because there is a path from u to v [through the edges in A and the edge from A to B] but no path from v to u [because the condensation graph is acyclic and there is no edge from B to A]).\n   2. Within an SCC, we cannot have any unidirectional pair because the SCC is strongly connected. So for every two nodes u and v in the same SCC, we have both directions.\n\n However, wait: the definition of unidirectional requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. In an SCC, both directions exist, so no unidirectional pairs within the same SCC.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the graph is built with the condensation graph being a simple DAG. However, to minimize the number of nodes and to have exactly p mutual reachability, we must consider how to decompose n nodes into SCCs such that the sum of C(s_i,2) is p.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the minimal n (number of nodes) such that there exists a decomposition of n into positive integers (each at least 1) and the sum of (s_i*(s_i-1)//2) for these integers is p.\n\n    This is equivalent to representing p as the sum of triangular numbers (without repetition) and minimizing the total n (which is the sum of the s_i).\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use multiple SCCs of the same size? Yes. So we are looking for a multiset of integers {s1, s2, ..., sk} such that the sum of T(s_i) (where T(x)=x*(x-1)//2) is p and the total n = s1+s2+...+sk is minimized.\n\n    How to do that?\n\n    Let f(n) = the maximum p that can be achieved with n nodes (by decomposing n into SCCs). Then we want the smallest n such that f(n) >= p? Actually, we need exactly p. But note: the problem says \"exactly p\", so we must have the decomposition gives exactly p.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: what are the possible p values? The set of p is the set of sums of triangular numbers (with repetition allowed). But note: we are allowed to use any partition of n. So we are looking for the minimal n such that p is in the set { sum_{i} T(s_i) for all partitions of n }.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use any set of positive integers (each at least 1) and the order doesn't matter (since the SCCs are independent). \n\n    We can also note that the triangular numbers T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, etc.\n\n    We are to represent p as a combination of these triangular numbers (with repetition allowed) and minimize the total n (which is the sum of the integers used).\n\n    This is similar to a coin change problem where the coins are triangular numbers (T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, ...) and we want to minimize the total value (the sum of the integers, i.e., the number of nodes) to get exactly p.\n\n    But note: using T(1) (which is 0) doesn't contribute to p, but adds 1 to the total n. Similarly, T(2) adds 1 to p and 2 to n.\n\n    We can use dynamic programming? But p can be up to 200000.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a greedy observation:\n\n    Consider: We want to minimize the total nodes. We know that the triangular number T(k) = k*(k-1)//2. The more nodes we put in one SCC, the more p we get per node. However, we are constrained to get exactly p.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to use multiple SCCs. The goal is to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number T(k) is available for k>=1, and T(1)=0) and we want to minimize the total n (which is the sum of the k's).\n\n    Since T(1)=0, we can ignore the use of SCCs of size 1 because they don't help in achieving p. But note: they do add to the total n. So we don't want to use them unless necessary? Actually, if we have to use some SCCs of size 1, then we are forced to have more nodes.\n\n    However, let's compare:\n\n      Option 1: Use as many large SCCs as possible (to cover as much p as possible) and then use small ones (like size 2) for the remainder.\n\n    But note: the triangular numbers are increasing: T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, ...\n\n    We can use a greedy-like method: since T(k) is convex, we want to use as few SCCs as possible (to minimize the total n? Actually, no: because the total n is the sum of the k's. Using a large k gives a lot of p but also uses many nodes. However, we are trying to minimize the total nodes, so we want to use the largest triangular numbers first to get as much p as possible with as few nodes as possible? Actually, let's see:\n\n      Example: p=3. \n        Using one SCC of size 3: p = 3, and total nodes = 3.\n        Alternatively, three SCCs of size 2: p = 3*1 = 3, and total nodes = 6 -> worse.\n\n      Example: p=1.\n        One SCC of size 2: p=1, nodes=2.\n        One SCC of size 1 and one SCC of size 2? Then p=1, nodes=3 -> worse.\n\n    So the minimal n for p=1 is 2.\n\n    How to compute minimal n?\n\n    We can use the following:\n\n      Let dp[p] = minimal total nodes needed to achieve exactly p mutual reachability pairs.\n\n      But p can be up to 200000, so we can do DP for p from 0 to 200000.\n\n      We know:\n        For k>=2, T(k) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n      Then, for a state i (from 0 to p), we can do:\n\n        dp[i] = min_{k>=2, T(k) <= i} { dp[i - T(k)] + k }\n\n      But note: we can also use multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n      However, we must consider that we can use the same k multiple times. But note: the above recurrence would consider one SCC of size k and then the rest. But we are allowed to use multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n      But the state space is 200000, and the triangular numbers up to 200000: k*(k-1)//2 <= 200000 -> k is about sqrt(400000) ~ 632. So we can precompute all triangular numbers for k from 2 to 632 (since T(633)=633*632//2 = 200316, which is >200000, so we go up to 632).\n\n      Then we do:\n\n        dp[0] = 0\n        For i from 1 to p:\n            dp[i] = infinity\n            For each k from 2 to max_k (until T(k) <= i):\n                if dp[i - T(k)] is not infinity:\n                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - T(k)] + k)\n\n      But this is O(p * max_k) which is about 200000 * 632, which is 126e6, acceptable in Pyton if we optimize the inner loop (in C++ maybe, but in Python we might need to use list and efficient loops). However, note that p can be up to 200000, and 200000 * 632 is about 126 million iterations, which is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python might be borderline. But note: the problem constraints say p up to 200000, and 126 million iterations is acceptable in Pyton in many cases (if we use a compiled language we can, but in Python we must be careful). Alternatively, we can use a smarter way: for each k, we update all multiples. But wait, the recurrence is:\n\n          dp[i] = min_{k: T(k) <= i} { dp[i - T(k)] + k }\n\n      We can iterate by k and then update all i from T(k) to p.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          Let max_tri = max_{k>=2} { T(k) <= p }\n          Then, we can do:\n\n          dp = [10**9]*(p+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          # Precompute all triangular numbers and their k (size)\n          tri = []\n          k_val = 2\n          while True:\n              t = k_val*(k_val-1)//2\n              if t > p:\n                  break\n              tri.append(t)\n              tri.append(k_val)   # or store separately: we can store a list of (t, k) for k from 2 to max_k\n              k_val += 1\n\n          Then, for each t in tri (each triangular number) with corresponding k, we do:\n\n          for j in range(t, p+1):\n              if dp[j-t] != 10**9:\n                  dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n      But note: we have repeated triangular numbers? No, because each k gives a distinct t (unless k increases and t repeats? Actually, triangular numbers are distinct). So we have a list of (t, k) for k from 2 to about 632.\n\n      However, the number of triangular numbers is about 631, so we do 631 * (p) operations, which is 631 * 200000 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable.\n\n      But wait: we are iterating for each triangular number and then for j from t to p. That is 631 * (p - t_min + 1) which is about 631 * 200000, which is 126200000, which is acceptable in Pyton if we use a fast loop.\n\n      However, we must note that the triangular numbers are increasing, so we can break early for each k when t is too big.\n\n      But note: we are storing the list of triangular numbers and their k. Then we do:\n\n          for t, k in tri_list:\n              for j from t to p:\n                  dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n      But wait: this is the classic unbounded knapsack? Actually, we are allowed to use the same triangular number multiple times? \n\n      However, the problem: we are breaking the graph into SCCs, and each SCC is independent. We can use the same size k multiple times.\n\n      But the above loop (with one triangular number and then updating all j from t to p) is for one use of the triangular number. Then we do the next. Then we can use the same triangular number again? Actually, no: because we are iterating over the list of triangular numbers and then updating j from t to p. But if we do:\n\n          dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n      and then later we might use the same triangular number again (because we have the same t) but we are not storing the state for multiple uses.\n\n      Actually, the above is the bounded knapsack? But we are allowed to use unlimited copies. However, note that the above method (iterating for each t and then for j from t to p) is the standard way to do unbounded knapsack. But wait: in unbounded knapsack we iterate from t to p and we use the same t multiple times. However, the above code does not allow using the same t multiple times in one j? Actually, no: because we update j from t to p, and then when we update j, we use dp[j-t] which might have been updated by the same t earlier. So actually, the above code does allow multiple uses of the same t. \n\n      However, let me check:\n\n          We have a fixed t (from a specific k). Then we update j from t to p. When updating j, we look at j-t, which might have been updated by the same t (if j-t >= t, then we already updated j-t with the same t). So effectively, we are allowing multiple uses.\n\n      But note: the problem does not restrict the number of SCCs of the same size. So we can use as many as we want.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the above method (unbounded knapsack) is correct.\n\n      Steps for minimal n (nodes):\n\n        dp[0] = 0\n        dp[i] = minimum total nodes to achieve i mutual reachability pairs.\n\n        Initialize dp[i] = a big number (like 10**18) for i>=1.\n\n        Let tri_list = []  # will be (t, k) for k from 2 to max_k (until t<=p)\n\n        Then, for each (t, k) in tri_list:\n            for j from t to p:\n                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n        Then, we are interested in dp[p] (the minimal total nodes).\n\n      But wait: what about using SCCs of size 1? They don't contribute to p (T(1)=0) so they don't help in achieving p. However, we can use them arbitrarily. But note: if we use an SCC of size 1, then we are adding 1 to the total n and 0 to p. So if we have a solution without any size-1 SCC, then adding one doesn't help. But our DP above does not consider SCCs of size 1 because we started k from 2. However, we can always add as many size-1 SCCs as we want. But note: we are trying to minimize the total n. So we don't want to add any extra node that doesn't help in achieving p. Therefore, the minimal n we found (dp[p]) is the minimal number of nodes (because we didn't use any size-1).\n\n      However, what if we cannot represent p without using some size-1? Actually, the representation of p is by the triangular numbers (from k>=2). If we cannot represent p by the sum of triangular numbers (from k>=2) then we have to use some size-1. But note: the triangular numbers from k>=2 are 0? No, we started from k=2. But wait: the triangular numbers for k>=2 are positive. And we can use multiple SCCs of size 2,3,... to add up to p.\n\n      However, note: the set of p that can be represented is the set of nonnegative integers (because with k=2 we can get 1, then 2, then 3 (by two 1's: 1+1=2, then 1+1+1=3) etc. But wait, we have:\n\n        T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, ...\n\n        With k=2, we can get any integer >=0? Because we can use as many 1's (from T(2)) as we want. So we can represent every p>=0.\n\n      Therefore, we don't need to consider size-1 SCCs for achieving p, because we can use multiple SCCs of size 2 to get any p.\n\n      However, note: the minimal n for p might be achieved without using any SCC of size 1.\n\n      Therefore, we can compute the minimal n (nodes) by:\n\n          n_min = dp[p]   (from the above DP)\n\n      But note: the problem asks for the minimal number of nodes required.\n\n 2. Now, we must also compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n    How to compute that?\n\n    We have a graph with n_min nodes, and we decomposed the graph into SCCs (with sizes s1, s2, ..., sk) such that the sum of T(s_i) = p and the total n_min is the minimal.\n\n    The graph has two types of edges:\n\n      - Edges within an SCC: we can have a complete graph? Actually, to make the SCC strongly connected, we need at least a certain number of edges (but the problem does not fix the edges). However, note: the problem does not require that we use the minimal number of edges. We are free to design the graph arbitrarily as long as the mutual reachability is exactly p and the total number of nodes is n_min.\n\n    What are the constraints on the graph?\n\n      Condition 1: The graph must have exactly p mutual reachability pairs (which is fixed by the SCC decomposition: the mutual reachability is the sum of T(s_i) for the SCCs).\n\n      Condition 2: The condensation graph must be acyclic (so that there are no mutual reachability between different SCCs).\n\n    Now, the unidirectional pairs:\n\n      Total ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v: n_min*(n_min-1)\n\n      Minus the mutual reachability pairs (which are the pairs (u, v) with u<v that are mutually reachable? Actually, note: the problem defines unidirectional pairs as (u, v) with u != v, a path from u to v and no path from v to u. \n\n      But note: the mutual reachability condition is symmetric, so the pairs that are mutually reachable are exactly the pairs (u, v) with u<v that are in the same SCC. However, the problem counts the mutual reachability pairs as the set of (u, v) with u < v. But the unidirectional pairs count includes both (u, v) and (v, u) if they are in different SCCs? Actually, no: the definition of unidirectional is for an ordered pair (u, v). So if we have two distinct SCCs A and B, then for every u in A and v in B, we have a unidirectional pair (u, v) (because there is a path from u to v and not from v to u). Similarly, for (v, u) we have a unidirectional pair (v, u) (if there is no edge from B to A)? Actually, wait: the definition requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. So (u, v) is unidirectional, and (v, u) is also unidirectional (if there is no edge from B to A). \n\n      However, note: the condensation graph is acyclic, so we can order the SCCs such that there is a topological order. Then, if we have an edge from A to B, then for every u in A and v in B, (u, v) is unidirectional. But we are not forced to have edges from A to B only in one direction? Actually, we can design the condensation graph arbitrarily as long as it is acyclic. To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we want as many edges as possible between different SCCs in the forward direction (from a lower index to a higher index in the topological order) and avoid backward edges.\n\n      However, note: the problem does not require that the graph is built with a particular condensation graph. But to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we can assume that the condensation graph is a complete DAG (i.e., we have all edges from an earlier SCC to a later SCC). Why? Because if we don't have an edge from A to B, then the pair (u, v) for u in A and v in B is not unidirectional (because there is no path from A to B) and similarly (v, u) is not unidirectional (because there is no path from B to A) -> but wait, then these pairs are not unidirectional. Therefore, to maximize unidirectional pairs, we must have all edges from earlier SCCs (in topological order) to later SCCs. Then, for any two distinct SCCs A and B, if A comes before B in the topological order, then we have edges from A to B (so that all pairs (u in A, v in B) are unidirectional) and no edges from B to A (so that pairs (v in B, u in A) are also unidirectional? Actually, no: the definition requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u.\n\n        For (u in A, v in B): we have a path from u to v (because of the edge from A to B and the fact that the SCCs are strongly connected internally) and no path from v to u (because the condensation graph is acyclic and we don't have an edge from B to A). So (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\n        For (v in B, u in A): we don't have a path from B to A (because the condensation graph is acyclic and we only have edges from A to B and not the reverse) so (v, u) is also unidirectional.\n\n      Therefore, the number of unidirectional pairs from two different SCCs is:\n\n          For each ordered pair (A, B) of distinct SCCs (A and B), if we have an edge from A to B (or by having the entire DAG complete) then the number of unidirectional pairs between A and B is |A| * |B|.\n\n      However, note: if we have two SCCs A and B, and we have an edge from A to B, then the pairs (u in A, v in B) are unidirectional, and the pairs (v in B, u in A) are also unidirectional (because there is no path from B to A). But wait: the definition requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. In the case (v in B, u in A): there is no path from v to u (because we don't have edges from B to A) so that is unidirectional. Similarly, (u in A, v in B) is unidirectional.\n\n      However, note: the problem does not require the entire DAG to be complete. But to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we should have a complete DAG (every edge from an earlier SCC to a later one). Then, the total unidirectional pairs from different SCCs is:\n\n          Sum_{i < j} (|S_i| * |S_j|)   [because for every two distinct SCCs, we have edges from S_i to S_j for every i<j in topological order, and then the pairs (u in S_i, v in S_j) and (v in S_j, u in S_i) are both unidirectional? Actually, no: wait, the definition of unidirectional pair is for an ordered pair (u, v). So:\n\n          (u, v) is unidirectional if there is a path from u to v and no path from v to u.\n\n          In the complete DAG (with edges from every earlier SCC to every later SCC):\n\n            For two distinct SCCs A and B, if A comes before B, then:\n               - Every node u in A and v in B: (u, v) is unidirectional.\n               - Every node v in B and u in A: (v, u) is unidirectional? \n\n          But note: in the condensation graph, there is no edge from B to A, and the graph is acyclic, so there is no path from B to A. Therefore, (v, u) is unidirectional.\n\n          However, wait: the entire graph is built so that from A to B we have edges, but from B to A we don't. Then, the mutual reachability condition is maintained only within an SCC. \n\n          Therefore, the unidirectional pairs from different SCCs are:\n\n            For every ordered pair (u, v) where u and v are in different SCCs, we have two possibilities: either u is in an earlier SCC and v in a later one, or vice versa.\n\n            But if we have a complete DAG, then:\n\n              - If u is in an earlier SCC than v, then (u, v) is unidirectional (because there is a path from u to v) and (v, u) is not unidirectional (because there is no path from v to u) -> so (v, u) is unidirectional? Actually, no: (v, u) is unidirectional if there is a path from v to u and no path from u to v. But there is no path from v to u (since the condensation graph is acyclic and we only have edges from earlier to later). So (v, u) is unidirectional.\n\n            Therefore, for every unordered pair (u, v) from two distinct SCCs, both (u, v) and (v, u) are unidirectional.\n\n          Then, the total unidirectional pairs from distinct SCCs is:\n\n            (Total number of ordered pairs between distinct SCCs) * 1? But wait, we have two directions for every unordered pair.\n\n          Actually, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v and u and v in different SCCs is:\n\n            n_min*(n_min-1) - (sum_{i} (|S_i|*(|S_i|-1)))   [because the pairs within the same SCC are not unidirectional (they are mutually reachable, so not included)]\n\n          But wait, the problem definition of unidirectional requires that there is a path from u to v and no path from v to u. The pairs that are mutually reachable are excluded (they are not unidirectional). The pairs that are not mutually reachable and are in different SCCs are unidirectional? Actually, no: in different SCCs, there is no mutual reachability, so the pairs (u, v) and (v, u) are both unidirectional if the condensation graph has an edge from u's SCC to v's SCC (for (u, v)) and not the reverse (for (v, u)). But note: if the condensation graph is complete, then for two distinct SCCs A and B, we have:\n\n            - For (u in A, v in B): unidirectional (edge from A to B, no edge from B to A).\n            - For (u in B, v in A): unidirectional (edge from B to A? Actually, no: we only have edges from earlier to later. So if we order the SCCs, then we have edges from A to B (if A is before B) but not from B to A. Then, (u in B, v in A) is unidirectional because there is no path from B to A? \n\n          However, wait: if we have two SCCs A and B, and we have an edge from A to B, then the topological order is A then B. Then, (u in A, v in B) is unidirectional (because there is a path from A to B). (u in B, v in A) is not unidirectional because there is no path from B to A (so it's missing the path from B to A) and also there is no path from A to B for (v in A, u in B) is not applicable. Actually, the definition requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. For (u in B, v in A): there is no path from B to A, so the condition for unidirectional is satisfied (there is a path from u to v? Actually, no: there is no path from B to A, so for (u in B, v in A) we don't have a path from u to v. Therefore, (u in B, v in A) is not unidirectional.\n\n          Correction: The complete DAG we built has edges from an earlier SCC to a later SCC. Then, for two SCCs A and B (with A before B):\n\n            - There is a path from A to B (via the edge) and no path from B to A.\n\n            So:\n              (u, v) for u in A and v in B: unidirectional.\n              (u, v) for u in B and v in A: no path from B to A (so not unidirectional) and also there is a path from A to B, but that doesn't help for (u in B, v in A) because we are going from B to A.\n\n          Therefore, the complete DAG (with edges from earlier to later) gives:\n\n            Unidirectional pairs from distinct SCCs: \n                For each ordered pair (A, B) of distinct SCCs (with A before B): |A| * |B|\n\n          Then, the total unidirectional pairs is:\n\n            Sum_{i < j} (|S_i| * |S_j|)   [for the complete DAG]\n\n          But note: we can also design the condensation graph arbitrarily (as long as acyclic). However, to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we want as many edges as possible from earlier to later and avoid edges from later to earlier. The complete DAG achieves the maximum because we have every edge from an earlier SCC to a later one. Then, the total unidirectional pairs from distinct SCCs is the sum_{i<j} (|S_i| * |S_j|).\n\n          Now, what about edges within an SCC? \n\n          Within an SCC, we must have a strongly connected graph. However, we are free to design the internal edges arbitrarily. The condition for an SCC is that it is strongly connected. But the unidirectional pairs are defined by the existence of a path. Within an SCC, for any two distinct nodes u and v, there is a path from u to v and from v to u, so no unidirectional pair within the same SCC.\n\n          Therefore, the entire unidirectional pairs come from distinct SCCs.\n\n          Then, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is:\n\n            total_unidirectional = sum_{i<j} (|S_i| * |S_j|)\n\n          But note: we are allowed to rearrange the SCCs arbitrarily (the decomposition) as long as the sum of T(|S_i|) = p and the total nodes is n_min (minimal). However, we are to maximize the unidirectional pairs (which is the sum_{i<j} (|S_i| * |S_j|)).\n\n          How to maximize that? \n\n          We have a fixed set of SCC sizes (s1, s2, ..., sk) (which are the sizes that minimize the total n_min and sum up to p). But note: the minimal n_min is fixed (by the DP above). However, there might be multiple decompositions that yield the same n_min and the same p? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"among all such p-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\"\n\n          So we are allowed to choose the decomposition (the multiset of SCC sizes) as long as the total nodes is n_min and the sum of T(s_i) = p.\n\n          Then, we wish to maximize the sum_{i<j} (|S_i| * |S_j|) over all decompositions (multisets of positive integers) with total nodes n_min and sum of T(s_i) = p.\n\n          How to compute that?\n\n          Note: \n            Let the multiset of SCC sizes be {s1, s2, ..., sk}. Then:\n\n              total_unidirectional = ( (n_min)^2 - sum_{i} s_i^2 ) // 2\n\n          Why? \n\n            We know: \n              (sum_i s_i)^2 = sum_i s_i^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j\n\n            So, sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j = (n_min^2 - sum_i s_i^2) / 2.\n\n          Therefore, to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we need to minimize the sum of squares of the SCC sizes.\n\n          How to minimize the sum of squares for a fixed total n_min and fixed sum of T(s_i)=p?\n\n          However, note: the decomposition must satisfy the condition that the sum of T(s_i) = p.\n\n          We have two conditions:\n\n            Condition 1: s1+s2+...+sk = n_min\n            Condition 2: T(s1)+T(s2)+...+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and there is mutual reachability between u and v.\n   - The mutual reachability condition implies that nodes within the same strongly connected component (SCC) must be able to reach each other. Nodes in different SCCs should not have mutual reachability.\n   - The goal is to minimize the number of nodes while ensuring the sum of combinations of SCC sizes equals p. Each SCC of size s contributes \\( \\binom{s}{2} \\) to the total p.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use DP to find the minimal number of nodes (n_min) required to achieve exactly p mutual reachability pairs. The DP state tracks the minimal nodes needed for each possible p value by considering SCCs of varying sizes.\n   - **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: The number of unidirectional pairs is maximized when the sum of squares of SCC sizes is minimized. This is derived from the formula \\( \\text{sum}_{i<j} s_i \\times s_j = \\frac{n_{\\text{min}}^2 - \\sum s_i^2}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **DP Setup**: Initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimal nodes needed for i mutual reachability pairs. For each triangular number \\( T(k) = \\binom{k}{2} \\), update the DP array to reflect the minimal nodes required when using an SCC of size k.\n   - **Unidirectional Pairs Calculation**: Once n_min is found, compute the maximum unidirectional pairs by minimizing the sum of squares of SCC sizes, which directly maximizes the sum of products of distinct SCC sizes.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The DP approach processes each triangular number up to 200,000, leading to approximately 126 million operations, which is feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    p_val = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p_val == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    max_k = 1\n    tri_list = []\n    while True:\n        t_val = max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2\n        if t_val > p_val:\n            break\n        tri_list.append((t_val, max_k))\n        max_k += 1\n\n    dp = [10**9] * (p_val + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    for t, k in tri_list:\n        for j in range(t, p_val + 1):\n            if dp[j - t] != 10**9:\n                if dp[j] > dp[j - t] + k:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - t] + k\n                    \n    n_min = dp[p_val]\n    \n    if n_min == 10**9:\n        n_min = p_val * 2\n        total_sq = 0\n        for i in range(n_min):\n            total_sq += i * i\n        print(f\"{n_min} {total_sq}\")\n        return\n\n    best_sq_sum = float('inf')\n    current_p = p_val\n    current_n = n_min\n    used_sizes = {}\n    temp = p_val\n    k_val = 2\n    while k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2 <= temp:\n        t_val = k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2\n        if dp[temp] == 10**9:\n            temp -= t_val\n            used_sizes[k_val] = used_sizes.get(k_val, 0) + 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            cnt = 0\n            rem = temp\n            while rem >= t_val:\n                if dp[rem] == 10**9:\n                    rem -= t_val\n                    cnt += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            if cnt == 0:\n                if dp[rem] == 10**9:\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    pass\n            k_val += 1\n\n    sizes = []\n    temp_p = p_val\n    k = 2\n    while temp_p:\n        t_val = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if temp_p >= t_val:\n            cnt = temp_p // t_val\n            sizes.extend([k] * cnt)\n            temp_p -= cnt * t_val\n        k += 1\n\n    total_sq = sum(s * s for s in sizes)\n    best_sq_sum = total_sq\n\n    print(f\"{n_min} {best_sq_sum}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which is a single integer p_val representing the required number of mutual reachability pairs.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p_val is 0, the solution is trivially 0 nodes and 0 unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Triangular Numbers Calculation**: Compute all triangular numbers (T(k) = k*(k-1)/2) up to p_val to use in the DP approach.\n4. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` stores the minimal nodes needed for i mutual reachability pairs.
