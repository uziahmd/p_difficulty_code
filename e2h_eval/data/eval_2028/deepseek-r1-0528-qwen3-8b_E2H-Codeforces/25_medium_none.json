При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to determine if it can be represented as the result of two consecutive identical messages `s` being sent, but with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The entire message t must be the concatenation of two copies of s, but with a positive overlap (and the overlap must be less than the length of s). However, note that the problem states that without any error, we just have two copies without overlap or with full overlap (which is not considered an error). So we are only concerned with non-full overlaps.\n\n But note: the example says \"abcd\" has no error, and \"abcabc\" has no error. However, \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" has an error because it can be split as \"abrakadabra\" + \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1 or 4.\n\n Important: The problem says that if the entire message is the two copies without any overlap, that is not considered an error. Also, if the entire message is the two copies with full overlap (so the second copy is completely overlapped by the first one? Actually, the problem says the overlap is positive and less than the length, so full overlap (i.e., the entire second copy is overlapped) is not allowed. But note: the example says \"abcd\" is okay (which is two copies without overlap, so no error). \n\n However, the problem also says: \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". Otherwise, output \"YES\" and a possible base string s.\n\n How can we think?\n Let the original message be s. Then the transmitted message t would be s + s', where s' is s with some prefix removed (the overlapping part). But note: the overlapping part must be a suffix of s and a prefix of s, and the length of the overlap (let's call it k) must satisfy 0 < k < len(s). Then t = s + s[k:].\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: t must be such that there exists an integer n (with 0 < n < len(t)/2) for which t can be split as:\n   t = A + B, where A is a prefix of t and B is a suffix of t, and A = s and B = s without the first k characters (where k = n). But note: actually, we have two copies of s: the first copy is s, and the second copy is s from which the first k characters were overlapped (so the second copy starts at index k). Therefore, t = s + s[k:].\n\n Also note: the entire t must be built from two copies of the same s. Moreover, the condition on the overlap is that k must be less than len(s).\n\n Another way: \n   Let n = len(t). We require that there exists an integer i (with 0 < i < n) such that:\n      t[0:i] = t[n-i:n]   [This is not exactly the condition]\n\n Actually, let me reexamine:\n\n We have two copies of s: the first is s, and the second is s but we remove the first k characters (so the second part is s[k:]). Then the total length of t is len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n Conditions:\n   Let L = len(s). Then t = s + s[k:L] (if we consider that the second copy is s without the first k characters, then the length of the second part is L - k). So total length |t| = L + (L - k) = 2*L - k.\n\n Since k is between 1 and L-1, then |t| must be between L+1 and 2*L-1.\n\n But note: we don't know L. However, we know that s must be such that the first L characters are s, and the last L-k characters are s[k:]. Also, the entire t must be consistent.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the message t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap of k (k>=1 and k < L). Then, we can consider that t must have a prefix and a suffix that are both equal to s, but the suffix is shorter by k. Actually, we can look for an overlap such that:\n\n   Let i be the length of the first part (which is the whole first s) and then the next part is the rest. But note: the second s is partially overlapping.\n\n Actually, we can break t into two parts: the first occurrence of s and the second occurrence of s without the first k characters. Then the entire string t is s + (s without the first k characters).\n\n This implies that the first |s| characters are s, and the next |s| - k characters are the tail of s (from index k to the end). And the total length is |s| + (|s| - k) = 2|s| - k.\n\n Also, note that the entire string t must be built from two copies of the same s. \n\n Observation: The entire string t must be periodic with period |s|, but with an overlap of k (so the period is |s|, but the overlapping part is k). However, note that the two copies are identical. \n\n We can try to find the minimal period? But note: the problem doesn't require the minimal s, just any s that could lead to t.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: if we assume that the two copies are of length L, then the entire string t must have length 2L - k, and k is in [1, L-1]. Therefore, L = (|t| + k) / 2. But k is variable.\n\n Another approach: since the length of t is at most 100, we can try all possible splits.\n\n What are the possibilities?\n\n Condition 1: The entire string t must be the result of two copies of s with an overlap of k (0 < k < len(s)). Then, we have:\n   t[0:L] = s\n   t[L:] = s[k:]\n\n But note: the entire t is then: s + s[k:], and the length is L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n Also, we must have that s[k:] is a substring of s starting at k, and the entire t is of length 2L - k.\n\n We can iterate over possible k (overlap lengths) and then set L accordingly.\n\n But note: k is the length of the overlapping part. Then, the two copies of s must be such that the first copy is s and the second copy is s without the first k. Therefore, the second copy must be the same as the substring of the first copy from k to the end.\n\n However, we don't know s. But we know t. And we know that:\n\n   t[0:L] = s\n   t[L:] = s[k:]   => which means t[L:] should equal t[k:L] (because s[k:] is the substring of s from index k to the end, and s is t[0:L], so s[k:L] = t[k:L])\n\n But also, the total length of t is L + (L - k) = 2L - k, so L = (|t| + k) / 2. Since L must be an integer, then |t| + k must be even.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are going to try all possible k (the overlap) from 1 to n-1 (but note: the maximum k cannot exceed L-1, and L must be at least (n+k)//2, and also k must be less than L). \n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible length of the first s (L). Then the overlap k must satisfy: \n   k = 2L - n - 1? Actually, from the total length: n = 2L - k  => k = 2L - n.\n\n But note: k must be positive and less than L, so 2L - n must be positive and 2L - n < L  => L < n.\n\n Also, from n = 2L - k, we have k = 2L - n. Then we require 0 < 2L - n < L.\n\n Conditions for L:\n   L must be an integer and (n + k) % 2 == 0 (which is automatically satisfied if we set k=2L-n, because then n = 2L - k, so n and 2L have the same parity? Actually, no: we are solving for L from k? Maybe better to iterate over L.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible split points.\n\n Note: the entire string t must be split into two parts: the first part is s (length L) and the second part is s without the first k (length L - k). And the second part must match the substring of s from k to the end.\n\n But we don't know L. However, we know that the entire string t must be built from two copies of s, so the first L characters are s, and the last L-k characters are s[k:].\n\n Also, the total length n = L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n Therefore, k = 2L - n, and we require 0 < k < L, so:\n   0 < 2L - n < L\n   => 2L - n > 0  => L > n/2\n   => 2L - n < L => L < n\n\n So L must be in the range (n/2, n). Since L is an integer, L from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1.\n\n Then, for each L in the range (floor(n/2)+1, n) [actually, from ceil(n/2)+1? Wait: L > n/2, so if n is even, then L must be at least (n/2)+1, and if n is odd, then L must be at least (n//2)+1 (since integer)].\n\n Then, k = 2L - n, and we require that k is positive and less than L (which is given by our range). Then we check:\n\n   Condition 1: The first L characters (t[0:L]) must equal the substring that starts at k (within the first s) and goes to the end of s? Actually, the second part of t is the tail of s (without the first k). The second part of t is t[L:], and its length is n - L. Also, from k = 2L - n, we have n - L = L - k (because n = 2L - k, so n - L = L - k). \n\n   Condition 2: The substring t[L:] must equal the substring t[k:k + (n-L)] = t[k:L] (because the length of t[L:] is n-L, and the length of t[k:L] is L - k, and we have n-L = L-k, so they are the same length).\n\n   Condition 3: Additionally, we must ensure that the second part (t[L:]) is indeed the tail of the first s (which is t[0:L]) starting from index k. So t[L:] must equal t[k:L].\n\n However, note: the second copy is s without the first k, so it is s[k:]. And s is t[0:L], so s[k:] is t[k:L] (of length L - k). And we require that t[L:] equals s[k:], i.e., t[L:] == t[k:L].\n\n But wait, what if k is greater than L? It isn't because we set k=2L-n and we have k < L (from our condition). \n\n However, there is another possibility: the two copies might be broken differently. Actually, the problem says the two messages are identical and the error causes the second one to be overlapped by the first. So the entire string t is built as:\n\n   t = s + s[k:]\n\n But note: the entire string t must have the first s and then the second s without the first k. Therefore, the second part (after the first s) must be exactly the part of s that comes after the first k characters.\n\n So the conditions are:\n\n   Let L be an integer such that n/2 < L < n, and let k = 2*L - n (which is positive and less than L).\n\n   Then, we must have:\n        t[0:L] == s (by definition)\n        t[L:] == s[k:]   => t[L:] == t[k:L]   (because s = t[0:L] and s[k:] = t[k:L])\n\n But note: the length of t[L:] is n - L, and the length of t[k:L] is L - k. And from k = 2L - n, we have n - L = L - k, so the lengths match.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n   Read t, n = len(t)\n\n   For L in range(floor(n/2)+1, n):   # L from ceil(n/2)+1? Actually, we require L > n/2, so we start from floor(n/2)+1 (which is the smallest integer greater than n/2). But note: if n is even, then n/2 is integer, so we start from n/2+1. If n is odd, then floor(n/2)+1 is the smallest integer greater than n/2.\n\n   However, note: n/2 might not be integer. We can do:\n\n        L_min = (n // 2) + 1   if n is even, then n/2 is integer and we want L_min = n/2 + 1, but integer division in Python: for even n, n//2 is integer. For odd n, n//2 is floor(n/2). Then L_min = (n//2) + 1, which is correct.\n\n   Then, for each L in the range [L_min, n-1] (because L must be at least L_min and at most n-1), compute k = 2*L - n.\n\n   Check if k is positive (which it will be because L >= L_min = (n//2)+1, then 2*L - n >= 2*(n//2+1) - n. If n is even: 2*(n/2+1) - n = 2 + n - n = 2, positive. If n is odd: 2*((n-1)//2+1) - n = (n-1) + 2 - n = 1, positive). And k < L (which is guaranteed by our L < n: because k = 2L - n < L => 2L - n < L => L < n, which is true).\n\n   Then, check:\n        Condition1: The first L characters of t (t[0:L]) and the substring starting at k (within the first L) of length L-k (which is t[k:L]) must be the same as the second part (t[L:])? Actually, we require t[L:] == t[k:L] (because the second part is the tail of the first copy).\n\n   But note: the second part is exactly the tail of the first copy (s) from index k to the end. And we are comparing the second part (which is the rest of t, of length n-L) to the substring of the first copy from k to the end (which is of length L-k). And we know n-L = L-k (because n = 2L - k). So they are the same length.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n            then we have found a valid s. Then we can output \"YES\" and s = t[0:L]\n\n   But note: there might be multiple L that satisfy the condition. The problem allows any valid s.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: is it possible that the same t can be explained by multiple s? Yes, but we only need to output one.\n\n   But wait: what if we don't find any L? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n Example: t = \"abcabc\"\n\n   n = 6.\n\n   L_min = 6//2+1 = 3+1 = 4? Then we try L from 4 to 5.\n\n   For L=4: k = 8-6 = 2.\n        Condition: t[4:] = \"abc\" (wait, from index4 to the end: 'c') -> actually, t[4:6] is \"bc\"\n        and t[k:L] = t[2:4] = \"ca\"\n        \"bc\" != \"ca\"\n\n   For L=5: k=10-6=4.\n        Condition: t[5:] is empty (since 5 to the end is nothing) and t[4:5] is \"b\" -> not the same.\n\n   But wait, is \"abcabc\" really having no error? According to the problem, \"abcabc\" is not considered to have an error because the error requires an overlap (so the two copies must be overlapped, but here there's no overlap). \n\n   However, note: \"abcabc\" can be written as two copies of \"abc\", and without overlap. So the error condition requires an overlap (positive and less than the length of s). Therefore, we don't consider the case without overlap. \n\n   But wait, what if we consider an overlap? Actually, the example says \"abcabc\" is not considered to have an error. So we must not output \"YES\" for \"abcabc\".\n\n   However, let's check with the above method: we are only considering L in (n/2, n). For n=6, we consider L from 4 to 5. \n\n   Why didn't we consider L=3? Because our condition was L>n/2 (i.e., L>3). But note: the condition for the error is that the two copies have an overlap (so the total length is 2L - k, and k>0). \n\n   But wait: what if we consider L=3? Then k = 2*3 - 6 = 0. But k must be positive. So we skip.\n\n   However, note: without an error, the message is just two copies of s without any overlap. In that case, the entire t would be s+s, so the length would be 2L. But in our representation, we require an error (overlap) so k>0. Therefore, we are only considering the error cases.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". And \"abcabc\" is without error.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that without error, the message is either two copies without overlap or with full overlap (which is not allowed). But actually, the problem says: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" — meaning full overlap is not considered an error. But note: full overlap would be k = L, then the second copy is completely overlapped. Then the total length would be L (the first copy) and then the second copy adds 0. So the message would be just s. \n\n   However, in the example, \"abcd\" is without error. That is two copies without overlap. \n\n   Now, the problem says: \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". \n\n   Therefore, we must not consider the case without any overlap (k=0) and the case of full overlap (k=L) as an error. But note: in our iteration, we are only considering k>0 and k<L (so we are excluding k=0 and k=L). \n\n   However, we must also consider: what if the entire string t is formed by two copies of s without any error? Then we must output \"NO\". But note: the problem says that without error, the message is either two copies without overlap or two copies with full overlap (which is not considered an error). But wait, the problem says: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" — meaning full overlap is not considered an error. But note: if we have full overlap, then the second copy is completely overlapped, so the total message is just the first copy. Then t = s. But then the two copies are s and s, and they are overlapped by the entire second copy. \n\n   However, the problem states: \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\". So full overlap (k = L) is excluded. Therefore, we are only considering the error when there is an overlap that is positive and less than the length.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". This includes two cases: \n        Case 1: Two copies without any overlap (k=0).\n        Case 2: Two copies with full overlap (k = L) — but note: if k=L, then the second copy is completely overlapped, so the total length is L (the first copy). Then t = s. But then how did we get s? It was two copies of s with full overlap. However, the problem says this is not considered an error? Actually, the problem says \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений\", meaning that full overlap is not considered an error. \n\n   But wait: the problem says that the error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and an error causes them to be merged. The merge requires that the end of the first and the beginning of the second are merged by identical characters. The length of the merge must be positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n   Therefore, if we get a message that is the concatenation of two copies without any overlap, that's not an error. Similarly, if we get a message that is the result of two copies with full overlap, then the result is the same as one copy, and that is also not considered an error.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". \n\n   But note: the problem does not say that the message must be the result of two copies. It says: \"определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети\". \n\n   So we are to check: is there a way to represent t as two copies of s with an overlap (0 < k < len(s))? \n\n   Therefore, if t can be represented as two copies of s with an overlap (0 < k < len(s)), then we output \"YES\" and s. Otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n   However, note: there might be other ways to form t that are not by two copies of s? The problem states: \"if the received message t does not contain an error\", meaning that the error model (two consecutive identical messages with a positive overlap less than the length) did not occur. But note: the error model produces a specific structure. \n\n   But the problem says: \"By transmission two identical messages consecutively, with an error, the message becomes s + s[k:] (with 0<k<len(s))\".\n\n   So the entire t must be of the form s + s[k:].\n\n   Therefore, we are only checking for that form.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that the message must be formed only by that error. It says: \"if it is possible that this is the result of the error\". \n\n   So if we can represent t as s + s[k:] (with 0<k<len(s)), then we output YES and one such s.\n\n   But what if t can be represented by two different s? Then we output one.\n\n   Now, what about the example t = \"acacacaca\"?\n\n   Example input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n   Expected output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n   Let's check \"acacacaca\": n=10.\n\n   We iterate L from (10//2)+1 = 5+1 = 6 to 9.\n\n   For L=6: k = 12-10=2.\n        Condition: t[6:] = \"cacaca\" (from index6 to the end: \"cacaca\") and t[2:6] = \"acac\", which is \"acac\", not equal.\n\n   For L=7: k=14-10=4.\n        Condition: t[7:] = \"caca\", and t[4:7] = \"cac\", not equal.\n\n   For L=8: k=16-10=6.\n        Condition: t[8:] = \"aca\", and t[6:8] = \"ca\", not equal.\n\n   For L=9: k=18-10=8.\n        Condition: t[9:] = \"a\", and t[8:9] = \"a\", so they are equal.\n\n   Then s = t[0:9] = \"acacacac\". \n\n   But wait, is k=8 valid? Then the second copy is s[8:] which is \"a\", and the entire t is s + s[8:] = \"acacacac\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacac\", but our t is \"acacacaca\" (length 10). \n\n   Let me count: \n        s = \"acacacac\" (length 8) -> wait, no: we set L=9, so s = t[0:9] = \"acacacac\" (but wait, t[0:9] of \"acacacaca\" is \"acacacaca\"? Actually, the string is \"acacacaca\", so t[0:9] is \"acacacac\" (because slicing in Python: [0:9] gives the first 9 characters, and the string has 10, so [0:9] is indices 0 to 8).\n\n   Then s = \"acacacaca\"[:9] = \"acacacac\" (8 characters? No, 9 characters: 'a','c','a','c','a','c','a','c','a') -> wait, actually:\n\n        t = \"acacacaca\" (indices 0 to 9)\n        t[0:9] = \"acacacac\" (which is 8 characters? Actually, no: from 0 to 8 inclusive, that's 9 characters: \n          index0: 'a'\n          index1: 'c'\n          index2: 'a'\n          index3: 'c'\n          index4: 'a'\n          index5: 'c'\n          index6: 'a'\n          index7: 'c'\n          index8: 'a'\n\n        So s = \"acacacaca\" from 0 to 8 (inclusive) is \"acacacaca\" without the last character? Actually, no: the string is \"acacacaca\", so the first 9 characters are \"acacacaca\" without the last 'a'? Actually, the string is \"acacacaca\" (10 characters). Then the first 9 characters are \"acacacac\" (without the last 'a')? \n\n        Actually, let me write:\n\n        t = \"a c a c a c a c a\" (10 letters: positions 0 to 9)\n\n        t[0:9] = \"a c a c a c a c a\" from 0 to 8 -> 9 characters: \"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\"\n\n        Then s = \"acacacaca\" (the first 9 characters) is \"acacacaca\" (without the last 'a')? Actually, no: the first 9 characters are the first 9, and the last character is at index9.\n\n        Then the second part is t[9:] = \"a\" (the 10th character).\n\n        Now, we require that the second part (t[9:]) equals s[8:] (the tail of s starting at index8). s[8:] is the substring from index8 to the end of s (which is index8 to index8, because s has length9, so from index8 to the end is one character: the 9th character of s, which is at index8 of t? \n\n        Actually, s is t[0:9] = \"acacacaca\" (the first 9 characters). Then s[8:] is the substring from index8 of s, which is the last character of s, which is 'a'. \n\n        Then t[9:] is 'a', and s[8:] is 'a'. They match.\n\n        Then we output \"YES\" and s = \"acacacaca\" (the first 9 characters). But the expected output is \"acaca\". \n\n        Why? Because the problem says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" — meaning they output \"acaca\", which is 5 characters.\n\n        So there might be multiple s that work.\n\n        How did they get \"acaca\"?\n\n        Let me check: if s = \"acaca\", then the two copies with an overlap of 2 (for example) would be:\n\n            s = \"acaca\"\n            k = 2: then the second copy is s[2:] = \"aca\", so t = \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaaca\" (length 8). But our t is \"acacacaca\" (length 10). \n\n        Or maybe they used a different k?\n\n        Alternatively, note: the problem says that the two copies are identical. So the entire t must be two copies of s with an overlap. \n\n        For s=\"acaca\", we can have different overlaps? \n\n        Let me try with s=\"acaca\" (length=5). Then the total length of t would be 2*5 - k = 10 - k. We need 10 - k = 10 => k=0, which is not allowed. Or wait, we have t of length 10. Then 10 = 2*5 - k => k = 0, which is not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe s is \"acacaca\" (length=7). Then k = 2*7 - 10 = 4. Then the second copy is s[4:] = \"aca\", so t = s + s[4:] = \"acacaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters. \n\n        Then s = \"acacaca\" (7 characters). Then we would output \"acacaca\". But the expected output is \"acaca\" (5 characters). \n\n        Why is \"acaca\" acceptable? \n\n        Let me check: if s=\"acaca\", then we require that the entire t is built by two copies of s with an overlap. Then the total length would be 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k. We have t of length 10, so k=0, which is not allowed. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"acaca\" (meaning they found s=\"acaca\") but how?\n\n        Wait, note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So the base string s must be repeated twice with an overlap. \n\n        But note: the example says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" — meaning that one possible answer is \"acacaca\". But the sample output says \"acaca\".\n\n        Actually, the sample input is given as:\n\n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So for the second example, they output \"acaca\", not \"acacaca\".\n\n        How can \"acaca\" (length 5) produce \"acacacaca\" (length 10)? \n\n        Condition: t = s + s[k:], with k positive and less than 5.\n\n        Then the total length is 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k. To get 10, we need k=0, which is not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, the example might have been processed differently.\n\n        Let me reexamine the example: \"acacacaca\"\n\n        We found one solution: s = \"acacacaca\" (the whole string without the last 'a')? No, we set s = t[0:9] = \"acacacaca\" (without the last character). But wait, the string \"acacacaca\" has 10 characters. Then the two copies are:\n\n            First copy: s = \"acacacaca\" (9 characters) -> wait, that is the entire string without the last character? Then the second copy is s[8:] (last character) and we append that, so we get \"acacacaca\" + \"a\" -> \"acacacacaa\", which is 10 characters? But our t is \"acacacaca\" (10 characters). \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            s = \"acacacaca\" (9 characters) -> then the second part is s[8:] = \"a\", and we append that to s to get \"acacacacaca\" (10 characters) but that is not the original t. \n\n        Let me clarify: the original t is \"acacacaca\" (10 characters). \n\n        Our condition for L=9: \n            s = t[0:9] = \"acacacac\" (the first 9 characters: indices0 to 8)\n            Then the second part is t[9:] = \"a\" (the 10th character)\n\n            And we require that the second part equals s[k:], with k=8 (because k=2*9-10=8). Then s[k:] = s[8:9] = \"c\" (the 9th character of s, which is at index8: the 9th character is the last of the 9, which is 'a'? Wait, let me index the string \"acacacac\" (9 characters):\n\n                Index0: 'a'\n                Index1: 'c'\n                Index2: 'a'\n                Index3: 'c'\n                Index4: 'a'\n                Index5: 'c'\n                Index6: 'a'\n                Index7: 'c'\n                Index8: 'a'\n\n            So s[8:] is 'a'. \n\n            Then the entire t should be s + s[k:] = \"acacacac\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacac\", which is 10 characters: \"acacacacac\", but the original t is \"acacacaca\" (10 characters: \"a c a c a c a c a\"). \n\n            They are different.\n\n        Wait, I see: the original t is \"acacacaca\", and we are taking s as the first 9 characters: \"acacacac\" (which is 9 characters). Then the second part is the 10th character: 'a'. Then the entire t would be \"acacacac\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacac\", which is 10 characters, but the original t is \"acacacaca\", which is 9 characters plus the 10th 'a'? \n\n        Actually, the original t is \"acacacaca\", which has 10 characters. Our constructed string is \"acacacacac\", which is 10 characters. But these two strings are not the same.\n\n        So what went wrong? \n\n        Condition for L=9: \n            We require t[L:] == t[k:L]\n            t[9:] is the substring from index9 to the end: which is one character: t[9] = 'a' (since t has 10 characters, indices0..9, so t[9] is the last one).\n\n            t[k:L] = t[8:9] (because k=8, L=9) -> that is one character: t[8] = 'a' (from the first 9 characters). \n\n            So condition holds: 'a'=='a'.\n\n        But the entire t is built as s + s[k:] = \"acacacac\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacac\", which is \"a c a c a c a c a c\", but the original t is \"a c a c a c a c a\" (10 characters: the last character is the 9th index, which is 'a'). \n\n        Actually, the original t is \"acacacaca\", which is:\n\n            index0: 'a'\n            index1: 'c'\n            index2: 'a'\n            index3: 'c'\n            index4: 'a'\n            index5: 'c'\n            index6: 'a'\n            index7: 'c'\n            index8: 'a'\n            index9: 'a'\n\n        Wait, wait! The example input is 'acacacaca'. How many 'a's are there? \n\n        'a','c','a','c','a','c','a','c','a','c' -> but wait, the example output says 'acaca' is acceptable.\n\n        Let me read the example again: the second example is 'acacacaca'. \n\n        Actually, the example input is given as: ['abrak",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with a positive overlap (i.e., the end of the first `s` overlaps with the beginning of the second `s` by some number of characters less than the length of `s`). If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two copies of `s` where the second copy starts after an overlap of `k` characters (0 < `k` < length of `s`). This means `t` can be split into two parts: the first part is `s`, and the second part is `s` without its first `k` characters. The total length of `t` will then be `2 * len(s) - k`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over possible lengths `L` of `s`. For each `L`, we calculate the overlap `k` as `2*L - len(t)`. We then check if `k` is positive and less than `L`. If so, we verify if the substring `t[L:]` matches the substring `t[k:L]` (the tail of the first `s` starting from `k`). If this condition holds, `s` is `t[0:L]`.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: \n   - If `t` cannot be split into two overlapping copies of `s` under the given constraints, output \"NO\".\n   - The solution efficiently checks all possible valid splits by leveraging the relationship between the lengths of `t` and `s` and the overlap `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    L_min = (n // 2) + 1\n    found = False\n    s_ans = None\n    \n    for L in range(L_min, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k <= 0 or k >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        if n - L != L - k:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n            s_ans = t[:L]\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_ans)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If the string is empty, output \"NO\" immediately.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of `s` (from `(n // 2) + 1` to `n-1`), compute the overlap `k` as `2*L - n`.\n4. **Validation of Overlap**: Ensure `k` is positive and less than `L`. Also, check if the remaining parts of `t` (after the first `L` characters) match the overlapping part of `s`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by two overlapping copies of `s`, ensuring correctness while minimizing unnecessary computations.",
