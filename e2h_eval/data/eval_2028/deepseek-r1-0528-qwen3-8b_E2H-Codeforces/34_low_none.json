And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n The total average is the sum of all sleep times in all weeks divided by the number of weeks (which is (n-k+1))?\n\n But note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives:\n   Week1: [3,4] -> sum=7, Week2: [4,7] -> sum=11. \n   Total sum = 7 + 11 = 18, number of weeks = 2.\n   Average = 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n However, note that the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait, let's read the problem again: \n   \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\"\n\n However, the example does not say to take the average of the averages of each week? Actually, we are to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n So, if we let S be the total sum of all sleep hours in every day that is included in any week, then note that each week is k consecutive days.\n\n But note: the same day might appear in multiple weeks? Actually, no: the weeks are contiguous and non-overlapping in the sense of being consecutive but the entire set of weeks we consider is from day0 to dayk-1, day1 to dayk, ... until day_{n-k} to day_{n-1}. \n\n However, when we sum over all weeks, we are summing the same day multiple times? Actually, the first day appears only in the first week, the second day appears in the first and second week, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n Total sum T = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j)\n\n But note: we can also compute T by using a sliding window and then accumulating the window sums. However, we can use prefix sums to do it efficiently.\n\n Let P[0] = 0, and P[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1} for i>=1.\n\n Then the sum for the week starting at i is P[i+k] - P[i].\n\n Then the total sum T = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n But note: the entire array has n elements, and our prefix sum P has n+1 elements.\n\n However, we can also see that T is the sum of each element a_i multiplied by the number of windows that include it.\n\n How many windows include a_i? \n   The window must start at an index j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j must be at least 0 and at most n-k (so the window ends at j+k-1, which must be < n).\n\n So the left boundary for j is max(0, i - k + 1) and the right boundary is min(i, n-k). Then the count for a_i is: \n   count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the prefix sum method:\n\n   T = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i]) \n     = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n] - P[n-k])\n\n But note: the last window starts at n-k, so we use P[n-k+k] = P[n] and subtract P[n-k].\n\n We can rearrange the summation:\n\n   T = P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n] - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n However, there is an easier way: we can use a single pass with prefix sums.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Read n, k and the list a.\n  2. If k == n, then we have one week, so the average is (sum(a)) / 1.\n  3. Otherwise, we compute the prefix sum array P of length n+1.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute without building the entire prefix sum array, but since n can be up to 200000, building the prefix sum is acceptable.\n\n  However, note that the total sum T is the sum of the windows. Each window is k consecutive days.\n\n  We can compute T by:\n\n      T = 0\n      for i in range(n - k + 1):\n          T += sum(a[i:i+k])\n\n  But that would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n, k up to ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous subarray of length k days from the sequence of n days. The solution involves efficiently summing the sleep times for all such weeks and then computing the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subarrays of length k in an array of size n. The key observation here is that each element in the array contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position i will be included in all windows (subarrays) that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k). \n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, which would be inefficient (O(n*k)), we use prefix sums to compute the sum of all elements up to each position. This allows us to calculate the sum of any window in constant time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index i-1. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each window of length k, the sum can be derived by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the window from the prefix sum at the end of the window plus k positions.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves:\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for building the prefix sum array and O(n) for summing all window sums, leading to an overall O(n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sum array, which is optimal for this problem given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == n:\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(total_sum / 1))\n        return\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum_all_weeks = 0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        start_index = i\n        end_index = i + k\n        total_sum_all_weeks += prefix[end_index] - prefix[start_index]\n    \n    average = total_sum_all_weeks / total_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the length of a week (k), and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the entire array represents a single week (i.e., k equals n), the average is simply the sum of all elements divided by 1.\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed where each element at index i holds the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index i-1. This allows efficient sum calculation for any subarray.\n4. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible window of length k, the sum is computed by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the window from the prefix sum at the end of the window plus k positions. This sum is accumulated to get the total sum of all window sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging prefix sums to avoid recalculating sums for overlapping windows, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
