Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s which is the binary representation of m (without spaces)\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as:\n        f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit of x is set} a_i\n\n But note: the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the bits in x correspond to positions from 0 to n-1?\n However, note the example: \n        n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary, but note that the problem says x is from 0 to 2n-1, so n bits? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n But wait, the example: \n        n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in 4 bits). Then f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n How does the indexing work?\n In the problem, the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1. The function f(x) uses the bits of x. However, note that the example input for the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          17 0 10 2 1\n          11010\n\n        Here, m is given by the binary string \"11010\", which has 5 digits. So n=5.\n\n        Then, the function f(x) for x=5 (which is 00101 in 5 bits) would set the bits at positions 0 and 2 (from right to left, starting at 0). \n        But note: the array a is [17, 0, 10, 2, 1]. \n\n        The problem says: if the i-th bit is set, then we add a_i.\n\n        However, how are the bits numbered? The problem states: \n            \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n        But note: the example says for x=5 (binary 101) with n=4, then they set the 0th and 1st and 3rd? Actually, wait: \n            Example: n=4, x=11 -> 11 in binary is 1011 (if we consider 4 bits). Then the bits set are at positions 0,1,3.\n\n        Now, the array a has 4 elements: a0, a1, a2, a3.\n\n        So the i-th bit corresponds to the i-th element of the array? \n\n        But note: the problem says the array has n elements, and the function f(x) uses the bits from 0 to n-1.\n\n        However, the input for m is given as a binary string of length n. \n\n        Therefore, we can assume that the binary representation of m has exactly n bits (with leading zeros if necessary).\n\n        So, the bits are numbered from 0 to n-1, and the i-th bit (from least significant to most significant?) or the other way?\n\n        Let's check the example: \n            n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits set: \n                bit0 (LSB): 1 -> index0\n                bit1: 1 -> index1\n                bit2: 0 -> skip\n                bit3: 1 -> index3\n\n        Then, the array a is [a0, a1, a2, a3] and we use the bits from the least significant bit (rightmost) as the 0-th bit.\n\n        However, the example m is given as \"10\" for the first test case? Actually, the first test case input is:\n\n            '2\\n3 8\\n10'\n\n        Here, n=2, and the binary string is \"10\", which is two characters. Then m = 2 (since '10' in binary is 2). \n\n        Then, x from 0 to 2: \n            x=0: 00 -> no bits set -> f(0)=0.\n            x=1: 01 -> bit0 set -> f(1)=a0=3.\n            x=2: 10 -> bit1 set -> f(2)=a1=8.\n\n        But the example output is 3, which is the maximum. However, note that 8 is greater than 3, so why is the answer 3? \n        Because the problem says: \"among all x for which 0<=x<=m\", and m=2. So x can be 0",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) among all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums the elements of array \\( a \\) at positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a '1'. The challenge is to determine which bits should be set in \\( x \\) to maximize \\( f(x) \\) without exceeding the given upper bound \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves setting bits in \\( x \\) from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). For each bit position, if setting the bit does not cause \\( x \\) to exceed \\( m \\), we include the corresponding element from \\( a \\) in the sum. If setting a bit would exceed \\( m \\), we must decide whether to set it or not based on the remaining bits.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach starting from the MSB to the LSB. For each bit position:\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '1', we can safely set the bit in \\( x \\) and add the corresponding element from \\( a \\) to the result.\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '0', we check if setting the bit would not violate the constraint. If not, we set the bit and add the element; otherwise, we skip it.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits in \\( m \\). This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            total += a[i]\n        else:\n            if i < len(a):\n                if a[i] > 0:\n                    total += a[i]\n                    s = s[:i] + '0' + s[i+1:]\n                    break\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to store the maximum sum.\n3. **Processing Bits**: The loop processes each bit from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). For each bit:\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is '1', the corresponding element from \\( a \\) is added to `total`.\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is '0' and the corresponding element in \\( a \\) is positive, the bit is set in \\( x \\) (by modifying the binary string \\( s \\)), the element is added to `total`, and the loop breaks early since further bits can now be set without exceeding \\( m \\).\n4. **Output**: The maximum sum `total` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes \\( f(x) \\) by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
