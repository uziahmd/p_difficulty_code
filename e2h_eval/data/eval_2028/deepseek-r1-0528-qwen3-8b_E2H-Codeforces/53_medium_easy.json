    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n 3. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, note that we want the maximum length.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   Since the string length is small (<=100), we can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n   For each length, check if there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n How to check for a given length L?\n   We can generate all contiguous substrings of length L and use a set (or dictionary) to count occurrences.\n\n But note: We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can start from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1) and go downwards until we find one that has at least two distinct occurrences.\n\n However, note: the entire string might not have any duplicate substring? Then the answer is 0.\n\n Steps:\n   Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n   For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):   # from n-1 down to 1\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            # We don't need to store all substrings, but we can use a set to record which ones we've seen and their counts?\n            # Actually, we just need to know if we have seen this substring at least once before (at a different starting index)\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a set for each L and break when we find a substring that is already in the set.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the largest L downwards, so the first L for which we find at least two occurrences is the answer.\n\n   However, we must consider overlapping occurrences. The problem says they can overlap, so we don't require non-overlapping.\n\n   Example: 'ababa'\n        Substring of length 3: \n            'aba' -> appears at index0 and index2 -> so duplicate, then answer is 3.\n\n   But wait: what if we have multiple duplicates? We are only concerned with the existence of at least two.\n\n   However, we cannot break as soon as we see a duplicate because we are iterating from large to small and we want the longest. So if we find a duplicate at a given L, we return that L.\n\n   But note: it's possible that a longer substring has no duplicate, but a shorter one does. We are going from large to small, so we stop at the first duplicate we find (which will be the largest L).\n\n   However, what if we have two different substrings of the same length L? We don't care, we just need one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        found = False\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen_substrings:\n                # We found one duplicate, so this L is valid.\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # or break out and then return L\n            else:\n                seen_substrings.add(substr)\n\n   If we don't find any duplicate for any L, then we output 0.\n\n   However, note: the above method uses a set for each L. Since the string is small (max 100) and L is from 99 down to 1, the worst-case total operations would be about 100*100 = 10000, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: for L=99, we have two substrings: the whole string and then nothing else? Actually, for L=99, we have n-99+1 = n-98 substrings? Actually, for n=100, L=99: we have 2 substrings.\n\n   Example: s = \"abcd\" (n=4)\n        L from 3 down to 1.\n        L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate -> next L=2.\n        L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate -> L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aaa\"? \n        n=3\n        L=2: substrings: \"aa\", \"aa\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n   But the problem says: the longest substring that can be met at least twice. In \"aaa\": \n        \"aa\" appears twice (overlapping is allowed: indices0 and 1). So 2 is correct.\n\n   Another example: \"ababa\"\n        n=5\n        L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> wait, we have \"aba\" at index0 and index2, so duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   But note: our code for L=3:\n        i=0: substr=\"aba\", add to set.\n        i=1: substr=\"bab\", add to set.\n        i=2: substr=\"aba\", found in set -> output 3.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if there are more than two occurrences? We don't care, we just need at least two.\n\n   But note: the set will remember the first occurrence and then the second occurrence (even if the third comes later) will also trigger the condition.\n\n   However, we don't need to worry because we are checking for presence in the set.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a substring that appears three times? Then we will detect the duplicate at the third occurrence.\n\n   One more edge: empty string? The problem states the string is non-empty.\n\n   Code structure:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)   # if no duplicate found\n\n   However, note: the problem input is given as an example in a list, but the input is one string per line.\n\n   Example input: \n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But actually, the input is read from stdin, so we do:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of strings. The problem says: the first input line contains the string.\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   However, the example output is given as a list of answers: ['0','3','2'] but note that the example input is three separate test cases? \n\n   Actually, reading the problem statement again: It says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This implies that there is only one string per run.\n\n   However, the example output is three numbers. \n\n   Wait, the example input format is ambiguous. Let me re-read:\n\n   \"Input\n    The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   And the example input is shown as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is likely just showing three examples. In reality, the program is expected to read one string from stdin.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"Output one number\".\n\n   Therefore, we assume one string per run.\n\n   However, the example output is given as a list of three outputs. This might be confusing.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"Output one number\", meaning for one input string.\n\n   So if we are running the program, we provide one string.\n\n   Example runs:\n\n        Input: \"abcd\" -> Output: 0\n        Input: \"ababa\" -> Output: 3\n        Input: \"zzz\" -> Output: 2\n\n   Now, let's test with \"zzz\":\n        n=3\n        L=2: \n            i=0: substr=\"zz\" -> add\n            i=1: substr=\"zz\" -> found -> output 2.\n\n   So the code should work.\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as a list, but in reality we are reading one string.\n\n   However, the problem says the string is on the first line.\n\n   So we write:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   Then the rest of the code.\n\n   However, what if the input has spaces? The problem says lower-case Latin letters, but we did strip. But the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters. So stripping is safe.\n\n   But wait: the example input might be given without quotes? We are using input().strip(), which reads the entire line and removes any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let me write the complete code.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is long? We are iterating from large L down to 1, and for each L we iterate over n-L+1 substrings. The total work is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if we don't break early) but since n<=100, the worst-case is about 100*(100+1)/2 * (length of substring) ... actually, the substring length is L, but we are storing the substring and doing set lookups. However, the set lookups are O(L) per operation? Actually, the set uses hashing and the substring comparison is O(L). \n\n   But note: the total number of substrings is about n*(n+1)//2, which is 5050 for n=100. And each substring we are storing and comparing, and the maximum L is 99, so the total operations would be about 5050 * (average length) which is around 5050 * 50 (on average) which is about 250000, which is acceptable for a computer.\n\n   However, we are breaking early for large L, so in many cases we break quickly.\n\n   But worst-case (like when there are no duplicates) we have to check all substrings. The worst-case is when the string has all unique characters? Then the answer is 0. Then we check all substrings. The total number of substrings is n*(n+1)//2, which for n=100 is 5050, and each substring has average length about 50, so the total operations is about 5050 * 50 = 252500 comparisons. Each comparison in worst-case (when the substrings are long and not equal) is O(length). But the average length is 50, so worst-case for one comparison is 50, and then 252500 * 50 = 12625000, which is acceptable in Python for n=100.\n\n   But note: we are building the set for each L. We can optimize by breaking the inner loop as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n   However, the current code does break the inner loop as soon as a duplicate is found, but we are still building the set for the entire L if no duplicate is found. Actually, we are building the set for the entire L and then checking the next L.\n\n   We can break out of the outer loop as soon as we find a duplicate in the current L.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from large L to small, so we break and output the first duplicate we find (the largest L). \n\n   But we must break the outer loop too.\n\n   Alternatively, we can structure the code to break out of both loops.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                duplicate_found = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if duplicate_found:\n            break\n\n   else:\n        print(0)\n\n   But wait, the else clause is for the for-loop, meaning if we didn't break the inner loop then we do this. Then we print 0.\n\n   However, we can also use a flag.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n   But the problem says to output one number, and we are exiting with a value if we find one. Otherwise, we print 0.\n\n   However, using exit(0) is not very clean if we are going to have multiple test cases? But the problem says one string.\n\n   But the problem says the input is one string, so we are done.\n\n   However, we are in a script, so we can do either.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # If the string is of length 1, then no substring of length>=1 can appear twice (because we need two occurrences, and the only substring is itself, but then we need two same substrings, but they must be at different indices. However, the same substring of length 1 can appear multiple times only if the string has repeated characters. But for length 1, the substring is just the single character. So if the string has duplicate characters, then the substring (each character) will appear at least twice? \n\n   Example: s = \"aa\", n=2. Then for L=1: \n        substrings: \"a\", \"a\". So we find duplicate -> output 1.\n\n   But wait, the example input was ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and the output for 'zzz' was 2.\n\n   Now, for s='aa': \n        n=2\n        L=1: \n            i=0: substr='a' -> add to set.\n            i=1: substr='a' -> found, so output 1.\n\n   But the example input \"zzz\" is of length 3, and we output 2. \n\n   So the code is consistent.\n\n   However, consider s='a' (length 1): \n        Then n=1, so L from 0 to 1? Actually, our L goes from n-1 to 1, so from 0 to 1? But n-1=0, so the loop for L in range(0,0,-1) doesn't run. Then we print 0.\n\n   That's correct because there's no way to have two distinct occurrences of a substring of positive length (the substring must appear at least twice, but the entire string is length 1 and we only have one 'a').\n\n   So the code handles n=1.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aab\" (n=3)? \n        L=2: \n            i=0: \"aa\" -> add\n            i=1: \"ab\" -> not in set -> add\n            no duplicate for L=2.\n        L=1:\n            i=0: 'a' -> add\n            i=1: 'a' -> found -> output 1.\n\n   So the answer for \"aab\" is 1.\n\n   This is correct because the substring \"a\" appears twice.\n\n   Now, let's run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0. Correct.\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3. Correct.\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given as one string, but the example input is shown as a list. We are reading one string.\n\n   So we write:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)\n\n   But wait: the problem says to output one number. We are exiting with a value if we find a duplicate, otherwise we print 0.\n\n   However, the problem expects one number. This is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't handle empty string.\n\n   This code is ready.\n\n   However, we can consider performance: worst-case (all distinct) we are building sets for every L from n-1 down to 1. But we can break early for large L, so the worst-case (no duplicates) we do:\n\n   L = n-1: one substring (so no duplicate)\n   L = n-2: two substrings (unless n=2, then two substrings, but if n=3, then two substrings: from index0 and index1)\n   ...\n\n   The worst-case is when the string has all distinct characters. Then we have to check all substrings. But the total number of substrings is O(n^2) and each substring comparison is O(L) and the set insertion and lookup is O(L) per operation. So worst-case time is about O(n^2 * L) = O(n^3) because the average L is about n/2.\n\n   For n=100, worst-case n^3 = 1000000, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   However, we can try to optimize by using a dictionary to cache the sets for different L? Actually, no, because the substrings for different L are different.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: start from the smallest substring and go up? But then we are looking for the longest, so we must go from large to small.\n\n   But note: we are going from large to small, and we break as soon as we find a duplicate. So if there is a long duplicate substring, we break early. The worst-case is when there is no duplicate, then we do the entire set of substrings.\n\n   Since n is at most 100, worst-case 5050 substrings, and each substring has average length 50, then the total operations is about 5050 * 50 = 252500 comparisons. And each comparison is O(L) so worst-case for one substring is 50, then 252500 * 50 = 12625000, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait, the set lookups: the set will store all the substrings of the current L. The number of substrings for a fixed L is (n - L + 1). The set lookup for a substring of length L takes time proportional to L (for hashing) and the set size is (n-L+1) which is about n. So the total cost for a fixed L is (n-L+1) * (cost of hashing a string of length L). The worst-case for a fixed L is (n-L+1) * L.\n\n   Then the total cost over all L is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n   We can compute: \n        n=100: sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L+1)*L = sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L = 101*L - L^2, from L=1 to 99.\n\n        = 101 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6)\n\n   But we don't need the exact number, but the order is O(n^3). \n\n   However, 100^3 = 1e6, and we are doing 100*(100) * (average L) = 10000 * 50 = 500000, but actually the set operations for each L are (n-L+1)*L, and then we sum over L from 1 to n-1. \n\n   Let me calculate for n=100:\n\n        Total operations = sum_{L=1}^{99} (101 - L) * L \n        = 101 * sum_{L=1}^{99} L - sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2\n        = 101 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6)\n\n        = 101 * 4950 - (99*100*199/6)\n\n        = 500000 - (328350)   [because 99*100=9900, 9900*199=1970100, then /6=328350]\n\n        Actually, 101*4950 = 500000 - wait, 100*4950=495000, 1*4950=4950, so 495000+4950=500000- wait, 495000+4950=500000-? 495000+4950=499950.\n\n        Then 499950 - 328350 = 171600.\n\n   So total operations is about 171600, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, the above calculation is for the worst-case (all distinct) and we are doing set operations for every substring. However, the set operations for each substring of length L take time proportional to L (the hashing time). But note: the set size is (n-L+1) and the hashing of a string of length L takes O(L). \n\n   However, we are not counting the set size in the above formula. The above formula (101*L - L^2) is the total number of substring comparisons? Actually, no, the above is the total number of substrings (each substring is considered once) and then the cost per substring is O(L). So the total cost is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L, which is 171600, and then multiplied by the average L? \n\n   Actually, no: the set operations for a substring of length L: \n        - The hashing of the substring is O(L)\n        - The set lookup is O(min(L, log(size))) but in worst-case the set uses a hash table and the hashing dominates.\n\n   So the total time is O( sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) * L ) = O(171600) for n=100. \n\n   But note: 171600 is the total number of substrings (each substring is hashed once). And the hashing for a substring of length L is O(L). So the total time is O( sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) * L ). \n\n   We calculated the sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L = 171600, so the total time is O(171600) operations, but each operation is a hash of a string of length L, so the actual time is O( sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L * L )? \n\n   Wait, no: the set lookup for a substring of length L: we are doing a hash and then a comparison in the worst-case (if there are collisions). But the standard set uses a hash table and the cost of one lookup is O(L) for the hash and then if there are collisions we might do some comparisons. However, the average case for a set is O(L) per lookup.\n\n   But note: the set for a fixed L stores (n-L+1) substrings, and the hashing of each substring is O(L). So the total time for a fixed L is (n-L+1)*L.\n\n   And then we do that for every L from 1 to n-1.\n\n   So the overall time is O( sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L ) which is O(n^3) in the worst-case (with n=100, we got 171600, which is about 1.7e5, which is acceptable).\n\n   However, wait: the above calculation is the number of substrings (each substring is processed once). And for each substring we do a hash operation of length L. The total time is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} [ (number of substrings of length L) * L ] = sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n   But note: the number of substrings of length L is (n-L+1). So we are doing (n-L+1)*L operations for each L.\n\n   And we are doing that for every L from 1 to n-1.\n\n   So the total time is indeed O( sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L ) = O(n^3) (since n is fixed at 100, it's constant).\n\n   Therefore, the code is efficient enough.\n\n   Let me write the final code.\n\n   However, note: we are using `exit(0)` if we find a duplicate. This exits the program. But the problem says to output one number. Alternatively, we can break out and then print the L.\n\n   But the problem expects one output.\n\n   Another approach: without using exit(0)\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 1\n   ans = 0\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                ans = L\n                found = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if found:\n            break\n\n   print(ans)\n\n   But wait, what if we break the inner loop and set ans to L, then break the outer loop and print ans.\n\n   However, initially ans is 0, and if we don't break, then ans remains 0.\n\n   This is the same as before.\n\n   But we can also use:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return   # if in function, but we are not in a function.\n\n   Without function, we can do:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)\n\n   Or, we can do:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # Check for each L from n-1 down to 1\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # Build a set of all substrings of length L\n        subs = set()\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in subs:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            subs.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)\n\n   I think the first version is clear.\n\n   But note: we are using `exit(0)` which terminates the program. This is acceptable for a script.\n\n   However, sometimes in competitive programming, we want to avoid using exit and instead use a function and return.\n\n   But the problem says one output.\n\n   Since the problem is small, we can use either.\n\n   Let me choose the version without exit, but using a flag and breaking the loops.\n\n   Code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   ans = 0\n   found_ans = False\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                ans = L\n                found_ans = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if found_ans:\n            break\n\n   print(ans)\n\n   But wait, if we break the inner loop, then we break the outer loop by checking found_ans? Actually, we break the inner loop and then check found_ans and break the outer loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # Start from the largest possible substring length\n   for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        substrs = set()\n        for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+length]\n            if substr in substrs:\n                print(length)\n                exit(0)\n            substrs.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   I'll choose the last one because it is concise.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, and we are breaking when we find the first duplicate.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n   However, the problem says to output one number. Using exit(0) is acceptable.\n\n   But if we are in an environment that does not like exit(0), we can use:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n   else:\n        print(0)\n\n   But this is more complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   ans = 0\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                ans = L\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n   else:\n        ans = 0\n\n   print(ans)\n\n   This is also acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the environment, and exit(0) is standard.\n\n   I'll stick to the version with exit(0) because it is clear.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script\", and we are not in a function, so exit(0) is okay.\n\n   However, let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> n=4, L from 3 to 1, no duplicate -> prints 0.\n\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> n=5, L=4: no duplicate, L=3: finds duplicate -> prints 3.\n\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> n=3, L=2: finds duplicate -> prints 2.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list, but we are reading one string. The problem says the first input line contains the string.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to handle empty string.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings with no repeating substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring within a string that appears at least twice. The solution must consider overlapping occurrences, meaning substrings can share some characters but must be distinct in their positions.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal approach involves checking all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest. For each length, we generate all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length as it is the longest possible due to our descending length check.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, we generate all substrings of that length and check for duplicates using a set. The first duplicate found during this check corresponds to the longest valid substring.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the string length. This is because for each possible substring length (O(n)), we process up to O(n) substrings, each of average length O(n). However, given the constraint (n â‰¤ 100), this approach is feasible and efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Iterating Over Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, and its length is printed immediately, terminating the program.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, the program outputs 0, indicating no repeating substrings exist.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
