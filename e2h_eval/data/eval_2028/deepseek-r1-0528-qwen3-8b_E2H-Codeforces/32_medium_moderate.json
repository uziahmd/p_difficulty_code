    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the current min or max (or both) if we remove the current minimum or maximum.\n\n However, note that the array might have duplicates. The idea is to consider:\n  Option 1: Remove the smallest element. Then the new min is the next smallest (which is the original second smallest) and the max remains the same.\n  Option 2: Remove the largest element. Then the new max is the next largest (original second largest) and the min remains the same.\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability doesn't change.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be achieved by either removing the smallest element, the largest element, or possibly both? Actually, note that sometimes the array has multiple smallest or largest, then removing one of them might not change the min or max.\n\n Actually, the problem is: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. So we have n possibilities. However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try each one.\n\n Insight:\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1]. Then the original instability is b[n-1] - b[0].\n\n When we remove an element, the instability of the remaining array will be:\n   If we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min (i.e., the first element in the sorted array and there's no duplicate at the beginning) then the new min becomes b[1] (if n>=2). Similarly for the max.\n\n However, if there are duplicates, then even after removing one occurrence of the min, the min might still be b[0] (if there's another b[0]). So we need to know how many times the min appears and similarly for the max.\n\n But note: we don't necessarily have to consider every element. We can consider:\n\n  candidate1: Remove the smallest element -> then the new min is the smallest element that remains. The smallest element that remains is:\n        if the smallest element appears only once, then the next smallest is b[1]; \n        but if the smallest appears multiple times, then the smallest remains b[0] (because we removed one occurrence, but there's still one left).\n\n  Similarly for the largest.\n\n However, we can also consider removing an element that is not the smallest or largest. But that won't change the overall min and max, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability will be the minimum among:\n\n  candidate1 = (if we remove the smallest, then the instability is (b[-1] - (the smallest value that remains)))\n      the smallest that remains is: \n          if the first occurrence is repeated (i.e., there are at least two smallest) then the smallest remains b[0].\n          else, the smallest becomes b[1].\n\n  candidate2 = (if we remove the largest, then the instability is (the largest that remains) - b[0])\n      the largest that remains is:\n          if the last occurrence is repeated (at least two largest) then the largest remains b[-1].\n          else, the largest becomes b[-2].\n\n But wait, what about removing an element that is somewhere in the middle? Then the min and max don't change, so the instability is the original one.\n\n However, we are trying to minimize the instability. The original instability is b[-1]-b[0]. Removing an element in the middle doesn't change that.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be the minimum between:\n\n   candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if count_min > 1 else b[1])\n   candidate2 = (b[-1] if count_max > 1 else b[-2]) - b[0]\n\n But wait, actually we can also remove an element that is not the min or max, but we are forced to remove one. However, note that if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain unchanged, so the instability is the original one. \n\n But is it possible that by removing a non-extreme element we get a lower instability? No, because the min and max are fixed (unless the removed element was the min or max). \n\n However, let me clarify: the instability is defined as (max of remaining) - (min of remaining). If we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the entire set do not change. Therefore, the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be the minimum between the original instability (if we don't remove an extreme) and the two candidates above? But note: we are allowed to remove one element. We are not forced to leave the extremes. We are forced to remove one, so we are considering all possibilities.\n\n But note: the original instability is the same as the instability when we remove a non-extreme element. So the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n   candidate1: remove one occurrence of the smallest (if there are duplicates, then the smallest might still be present)\n   candidate2: remove one occurrence of the largest (if there are duplicates, then the largest might still be present)\n\n However, we must account for the fact that the array might have only one distinct element. Then after removal, the instability is 0.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n   Sort the array.\n\n   Let b = sorted(a)\n\n   Option 1: Remove the smallest element. Then the new min is:\n        if the first element appears only once (i.e., b[0] < b[1]), then the new min is b[1], so instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n        else, the new min is still b[0] (because there's at least two of b[0]), so instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original) unless the array has only two elements and we remove one of the duplicates? Actually, if we remove one of the duplicates, the min and max remain the same.\n\n   Similarly, Option 2: Remove the largest element. Then the new max is:\n        if the last element appears only once (i.e., b[-1] > b[-2]), then the new max is b[-2], so instability = b[0] (the min) to b[-2] (the new max) -> b[-2] - b[0]\n        else, the new max is still b[-1], so instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original)\n\n But wait, what if the array has more than two elements and we remove an element that is not the min or max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original.\n\n However, note: we are looking for the minimum instability. So we can compute:\n\n   candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if b[0] == b[1] else b[1])   # This is incorrect because if there are multiple smallest, we don't change the min. But if we remove one smallest, the min becomes the next distinct smallest if there was a duplicate, then we use the next distinct? Actually, no.\n\n Let me reframe:\n\n   After removing one occurrence of the smallest, the new min is:\n        If there exists at least one other element equal to b[0] (i.e., the frequency of b[0] is more than 1), then the min remains b[0].\n        Otherwise, the min becomes b[1].\n\n   Similarly, after removing one occurrence of the largest, the new max is:\n        If the frequency of b[-1] is more than 1, then the max remains b[-1].\n        Otherwise, the max becomes b[-2].\n\n   Therefore, the two candidate instabilities are:\n\n        candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if (count_min > 1) else b[1])\n        candidate2 = (b[-1] if (count_max > 1) else b[-2]) - b[0]\n\n   But note: we can also consider removing an element that is not the min or max, which gives the original instability: candidate0 = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n   However, we don't need to consider candidate0 separately because:\n\n        candidate1 is: if we remove one smallest, then the instability is (max - new_min). The max is still the same (unless we remove the max too, but we are removing one element, so we only remove one smallest).\n\n        Similarly, candidate2 is: if we remove one largest, then the instability is (new_max - min).\n\n   And if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability is the original.\n\n   So the answer is the minimum among candidate1, candidate2, and candidate0?\n\n   But note: candidate0 is the original, and candidate1 and candidate2 might be larger or smaller than candidate0?\n\n   Example: [1,3,3,7] -> sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\n        candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> new min: since 1 appears only once, then new min is 3. So instability = 7 - 3 = 4.\n        candidate2: remove largest (7) -> new max: since 7 appears only once, then new max is 3. So instability = 3 - 1 = 2.\n        candidate0: the original is 6.\n\n        Then the minimum is 2.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 2.\n\n   However, note that we are allowed to remove any one element. In this example, removing 7 gives 2, which is better than removing 1 (which gives 4) and leaving the original (6) is worse.\n\n   But why did the example say: \"In the first example you can remove 7 then instability of the remaining array will be 3 - 1 = 2\"? \n\n   Wait, that doesn't match: after removing 7, the array becomes [1,3,3]. The min is 1 and the max is 3, so instability is 3-1=2. But according to our candidate2 calculation:\n\n        candidate2: remove largest (7) -> new max: since 7 appears only once, we use b[-2]=3. Then 3 - b[0] = 3-1=2. Correct.\n\n   Now, what if we remove one of the 3's? Then the array becomes [1,3,7]. The min is 1, the max is 7, so instability is 6 (same as original). \n\n   So the minimal instability is the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, and the original? Actually, we don't need to consider the original because if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability is the original, and we are already considering the cases where we remove the min or the max. But note: what if we have an array with three distinct numbers? Then removing a middle element leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original? Actually, no: because we are allowed to remove any one element. The minimal instability might be the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original, but note that the original is the worst-case scenario (when we remove a non-extreme element). However, we are trying to minimize.\n\n   But wait, the minimal instability must be the minimum of:\n\n        candidate1: remove the smallest (if we remove the smallest and there are duplicates, then candidate1 = original, otherwise candidate1 = (max - next_min))\n        candidate2: remove the largest (if we remove the largest and there are duplicates, then candidate2 = original, otherwise candidate2 = (next_max - min))\n\n        and also we must consider the possibility of removing an element that is not the min or max? But then the instability is the original, so we don't need to consider it separately because the original is already the worst.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove one element arbitrarily. The minimal instability we can get is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   But wait, is that always true? Consider an array with two elements: [1, 2]. Then:\n\n        candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> instability = 2 - (since there's no other element, but wait, the array has two elements: after removing 1, the array is [2]. Then min=2, max=2 -> instability=0. But according to our formula:\n\n            candidate1: remove smallest. The smallest is 1, and it appears only once. Then new min is the next smallest: but there is no next smallest? Actually, the array has two elements. After removing the smallest, the array has one element. So the next smallest should be the next element in the sorted array? \n\n        How do we handle the case when the array has two elements?\n\n        We have to be careful: when we remove one element from an array of two, the remaining array has one element. Then the instability is 0.\n\n        Our candidate1 calculation: \n            candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if count_min>1 else b[1])\n            Here, count_min (for 1) is 1, so we use b[1] (which is 2). Then candidate1 = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\n        candidate2: remove the largest (2) -> then the array is [1]. Then instability = 1 - 1 = 0? \n            candidate2 = (b[-1] if count_max>1 else b[-2]) - b[0]\n            Here, count_max for 2 is 1, so we use b[-2] which is 1. Then 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n        So the answer is 0.\n\n   Another example: [1,1,2,3] (n=4)\n\n        Original instability: 3-1=2.\n\n        candidate1: remove smallest (1). The smallest is 1, and there are two 1s. Then the new min is still 1 (because there's another 1). Then instability = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\n        candidate2: remove largest (3). The largest is 3, and it appears once. Then the new max is 2. Then instability = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n        So the minimal instability is 1.\n\n   But wait, what if we remove the middle element? For example, remove the 2? Then the array becomes [1,1,3]. The min is 1, the max is 3, instability=2.\n\n        Or remove one of the 1's? Then we get [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n        Or remove the 3? Then [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n\n        So indeed, the minimal is 1.\n\n   However, note that the above candidate1 and candidate2 calculations rely on the counts. We can do:\n\n        Let b = sorted(a)\n        Let m = len(b)\n\n        candidate1 = b[m-1] - (b[0] if (b.count(b[0]) > 1) else b[1])\n        candidate2 = (b[m-1] if (b.count(b[m-1]) > 1) else b[m-2]) - b[0]\n\n        Then answer = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n   But wait, using b.count might be O(n) and we do it twice, and n can be up to 10^5. That would be O(2*n) which is acceptable? Actually, 10^5 is acceptable for two passes? But note: the problem says n up to 10^5, and we are doing two linear scans (each count is O(n)), so total O(2n) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can do better by precomputing the counts or using pointers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        To check if the first element is duplicated, we can check if m >= 2 and b[0] == b[1]. Similarly, for the last element, if m>=2 and b[-1] == b[-2] (but wait, if m==2 then b[-1]==b[-2] only if the two are equal).\n\n   But note: if the array has one element? The problem states n>=2.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Let m = n (the length)\n\n        candidate1: \n            if the first element is duplicated (i.e., m>=2 and b[0] == b[1]): then the new min is still b[0], so candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else: candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n        candidate2:\n            if the last element is duplicated (i.e., m>=2 and b[-1] == b[-2]): then the new max is still b[-1], so candidate2 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else: candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        Then answer = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has two elements and they are the same? Then:\n\n        [x,x]: \n            candidate1: since first element duplicated -> candidate1 = x - x = 0.\n            candidate2: since last element duplicated -> candidate2 = x - x = 0.\n            Then answer = 0.\n\n        Example: [1,1] -> remove one 1, then the array [1] -> instability 0.\n\n        But what if the array has two distinct elements? [1,2]:\n\n            candidate1: first element is 1, and 1 != 2 -> so candidate1 = 2 - 2? Wait, no: we have two elements: [1,2]. Then:\n\n                candidate1: remove the smallest (1). Then the new min is the next smallest. Since the array has two elements, after removing the first, we have [2]. Then the min is 2. So candidate1 = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\n                candidate2: remove the largest (2). Then the array becomes [1]. Then candidate2 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n            So we return 0.\n\n        But wait, in the two distinct case, we can use the above condition:\n\n            candidate1: \n                Check if the first element is duplicated: in [1,2] -> no, so we use b[1] (which is 2). Then candidate1 = 2 (max) - 2 (new min) = 0.\n\n            candidate2:\n                Check if the last element is duplicated: in [1,2] -> no, so we use b[-2] (which is 1). Then candidate2 = 1 (new max) - 1 (min) = 0.\n\n        So the above condition works.\n\n   However, note: the above condition for candidate1 and candidate2 does not work if the array has more than two elements and the duplicates are not consecutive? \n\n        Actually, we sort the array, so duplicates are consecutive.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has more than two elements and the smallest is duplicated but not adjacent? Actually, no: the array is sorted, so duplicates are adjacent.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        Step 1: read n\n        Step 2: read the list a\n        Step 3: sort the list\n        Step 4: Let m = n\n\n        candidate1 = None\n        candidate2 = None\n\n        # For candidate1: remove the smallest element\n        # Check if the smallest appears more than once: look at the next element (if exists) and see if it is the same as the first.\n        if m == 0:\n            # Not possible, n>=2\n            pass\n        elif m == 1:\n            # Not possible, n>=2\n            pass\n        else:\n            # Check for duplicate at the beginning\n            if b[0] == b[1]:\n                # Then removing one smallest doesn't change the min\n                candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else:\n                candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n            # Check for duplicate at the end\n            if b[-1] == b[-2]:\n                candidate2 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else:\n                candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        Then answer = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the smallest but there are duplicates? Then the instability remains the same. Similarly for the largest.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The minimal instability might be achieved by removing a non-extreme element? Actually, no, because removing a non-extreme element doesn't change the min and max. Therefore, the instability is the same as the original. But the original might be larger than candidate1 or candidate2.\n\n   But note: candidate1 and candidate2 are computed by assuming we remove the smallest or the largest. However, if the array has duplicates, then removing the smallest might not change the min (so the instability remains the original) and similarly for the largest.\n\n   Therefore, we are covering the effect of removing one occurrence of the smallest and one occurrence of the largest.\n\n   However, consider: what if the array has more than two distinct values and we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original. But we are not computing that.\n\n   But note: we are taking the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2. However, it is possible that the original instability is less than candidate1 or candidate2? \n\n   Example: [1, 2, 100] (n=3)\n\n        Original instability: 100-1 = 99.\n\n        candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> then the array is [2,100]. The min is 2, max is 100 -> instability 98.\n        candidate2: remove largest (100) -> then the array is [1,2]. The min is 1, max is 2 -> instability 1.\n\n        So the minimal is 1.\n\n        But wait, if we remove the middle element (2), then the array is [1,100] -> instability 99, which is the original.\n\n        However, candidate1 is 98 and candidate2 is 1. So the minimum is 1.\n\n        But note: the original instability is 99, which is worse than candidate2.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2, and we don't need to consider the original because:\n\n            candidate1 and candidate2 are computed by removing one specific element (the smallest or the largest). However, if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, the instability is the original, but we are allowed to choose which element to remove, and we are already considering the best two possibilities (removing the smallest and removing the largest). And sometimes the best possibility is to remove the largest (like in the example above) and that gives 1, which is better than the original.\n\n        But wait, in the example above, the original instability is 99, and we are comparing candidate1 (98) and candidate2 (1). We take 1.\n\n        However, what if we have an array where the original instability is the minimum? \n\n        Example: [1, 2, 3] (n=3)\n\n            Original instability: 2.\n\n            candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> [2,3] -> instability 1.\n            candidate2: remove largest (3) -> [1,2] -> instability 1.\n\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n        What if we remove the middle element? Then the array is [1,3] -> instability 2, which is the same as the original. But 1 is better.\n\n        So the minimal instability is 1.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to consider the original because candidate1 and candidate2 are always <= the original? \n\n        Why? Because:\n\n            candidate1: if we remove the smallest, then the min either stays the same (if there are duplicates) or increases (if no duplicates). In either case, the max is the same, so the instability is <= original (if the min increases, then instability decreases; if the min stays the same, then instability remains the same).\n\n            Similarly, candidate2: if we remove the largest, then the max either stays the same (if duplicates) or decreases (if no duplicates). Then the instability is <= original.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   But wait, in the example [1,2,3] we see that candidate1 and candidate2 are 1, which is less than the original (2). \n\n   However, note that in the example [1,2,3] the original is 2, and removing the smallest gives [2,3] -> 1, and removing the largest gives [1,2] -> 1. \n\n   Therefore, the answer is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   But wait, what if the array is [1, 10, 100, 1000]? \n\n        Original instability: 999.\n\n        candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> [10,100,1000] -> 1000-10=990.\n        candidate2: remove largest (1000) -> [1,10,100] -> 100-1=99.\n\n        Then answer is 99.\n\n        But if we remove 10? Then the array is [1,100,1000] -> 1000-1=999 (same as original).\n        Or remove 100? Then [1,10,1000] -> 1000-1=999.\n\n        So the minimal is 99.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        m = n\n\n        # If the array has two elements, then we have two candidates.\n\n        # candidate1: remove the smallest element\n        if m == 0:\n            print(0)\n        elif m == 1:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Check if the first element is duplicated (at least two of the same at the beginning)\n            if a[0] == a[1]:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n            if a[-1] == a[-2]:\n                cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n            ans = min(cand1, cand2)\n            print(ans)\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has more than two elements and the smallest is duplicated, but the largest is not, and vice versa? We are only checking the immediate next and previous.\n\n   Example: [1,1,2,3] (as above) -> \n        cand1: a[0]==a[1] -> True, so cand1 = 3-1=2.\n        cand2: a[-1] (3) != a[-2] (2) -> False, so cand2 = 2-1=1.\n        Then ans = 1. Correct.\n\n   But wait, in the example [1,1,2,3] we have two 1's. Removing one 1: the min remains 1, so the instability is 3-1=2. Removing the 3: then the max becomes 2, so instability 2-1=1.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not limited to removing the smallest or the largest. But we argued that removing a non-extreme element doesn't help. But what if we remove a 1? Then we get [1,2,3] -> instability 2. Removing a 2? Then [1,1,3] -> instability 2. Removing a 3? Then [1,1,2] -> instability 1. So indeed, the minimal is 1.\n\n   But wait, why didn't we consider the possibility of removing a non-smallest or non-largest? Because we showed that removing a non-extreme element leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability is the original (which is 3-1=2). But note: in [1,1,2,3] the original is 2. However, when we remove one of the 1's, the min remains 1 (so the min doesn't change) and the max remains 3 (so the max doesn't change) -> wait, no! Actually, when we remove one of the 1's, the min is still 1 (because there's still one 1 left). So the min doesn't change, and the max is 3, so instability is 3-1=2. \n\n   But wait, then why did we compute cand1 as 2 (by the above code) and then the answer is 1 (from cand2)? \n\n   The above code correctly computes cand1 as 2 and cand2 as 1, so the minimum is 1.\n\n   However, note: the above code does not consider the possibility of removing an arbitrary element. But we proved that removing an element that is not the smallest or largest doesn't change the min and max, so the instability is the original (2). And 2 is greater than 1, so the minimal is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the array is [1,2,3,4]?\n\n        Original instability: 3.\n\n        cand1: remove smallest (1) -> [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2.\n        cand2: remove largest (4) -> [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n\n        Then answer = 2.\n\n        Is that correct? Yes, because if we remove 1, instability becomes 2; if we remove 4, instability becomes 2; if we remove 2, then [1,3,4] -> 4-1=3; if we remove 3, then [1,2,4] -> 4-1=3.\n\n        So the minimal is 2.\n\n   One more example: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n        cand1: remove 1 -> [2,3,4,5] -> 5-2=3.\n        cand2: remove 5 -> [1,2,3,4] -> 4-1=3.\n\n        Then answer=3.\n\n        But what if we remove 2? Then [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4.\n        Remove 3: [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4.\n        Remove 4: [1,2,3,5] -> 5-1=4.\n\n        So the minimal is 3.\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, note: the above method only considers two candidates: removing the smallest and removing the largest. But what if the array has duplicates and we remove an element that is the smallest (with duplicates) and then the instability remains the same? Then candidate1 is the original, and candidate2 might be lower. But we are taking the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        n_val = n\n        if n_val == 0:\n            print(0)\n        elif n_val == 1:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Check the first two and the last two\n            # Candidate 1: remove the smallest element\n            if a[0] == a[1]:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n            # Candidate 2: remove the largest element\n            if a[-1] == a[-2]:\n                cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n            print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has more than two elements and the smallest is duplicated, but the array has more than two distinct numbers? The above code still works because we are only checking the immediate next element for the smallest and the immediate previous for the largest.\n\n   But what if the array has three distinct numbers and the smallest is duplicated? Example: [1,1,2,3] (already done) and [1,1,3,4] (here, the smallest is 1, duplicated, then the next distinct is 3).\n\n        cand1: a[0]==a[1] -> yes, so cand1 = 4-1=3.\n        cand2: a[-1]=4, a[-2]=3 -> not equal, so cand2 = 3-1=2.\n\n        Then answer=2.\n\n        Check: \n            Remove smallest: [1,3,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> instability 3 -> but wait, we computed cand1 as 3 (using the original max and the original min) because the min didn't change. But wait, the array after removing one smallest (one of the 1's) is [1,3,4]. The min is 1 (because there's still one 1) and the max is 4, so instability=3.\n\n            Remove largest: [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n        So the minimal is 2, which matches.\n\n   However, note: in the example [1,1,3,4], when we remove the smallest (one 1) the array becomes [1,3,4] and the min is 1 (because there's still one 1) so instability=3.\n\n   The code correctly sets cand1 = 4-1=3.\n\n   But wait, what if the array is [1,1,1,100000] (n=4)?\n\n        cand1: remove smallest (1) -> since there are duplicates, cand1 = 100000 - 1 = 99999.\n        cand2: remove largest (100000) -> since the largest is unique, cand2 = 1 (the last but one) - 1 = 0.\n\n        Then answer=0.\n\n        But check: \n            Remove one 1: [1,1,100000] -> min=1, max=100000 -> instability=99999.\n            Remove the 100000: [1,1,1] -> min=1, max=1 -> instability=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n        elif n == 1:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Check for the first two and last two\n            if a[0] == a[1]:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n            if a[-1] == a[-2]:\n                cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n            else:\n                cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n            print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has only two distinct values and more than two elements? Example: [1,2,2,3] (n=4)\n\n        Original instability: 3-1=2.\n\n        cand1: remove smallest (1) -> [2,2,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> instability=1.\n        cand2: remove largest (3) -> [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n\n        Then answer=1.\n\n        But according to the code:\n\n            cand1: a[0]=1, a[1]=2 -> not equal, so cand1 = 3 (a[-1]) - 2 (a[1]) = 1.\n            cand2: a[-1]=3, a[-2]=2 -> not equal, so cand2 = 2 (a[-2]) - 1 (a[0]) = 1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   One more edge: [1,2,2,2] (n=4)\n\n        cand1: remove smallest (1) -> [2,2,2] -> instability 0.\n        cand2: remove largest (2) -> [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n\n        According to code:\n\n            cand1: a[0]==a[1]? 1==2 -> no, so cand1 = a[-1] (2) - a[1] (2) = 0.\n            cand2: a[-1]==a[-2]? 2==2 -> yes, so cand2 = a[-1] (2) - a[0] (1) = 1.\n\n        Then answer=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the array elements are at least 1 and up to 10^5, and n>=2, so we don't need to handle n=0 or n=1.\n\n   We can simplify by reading the inputs and then:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can only affect the instability if that element is either the current minimum or maximum. If the removed element is neither the minimum nor the maximum, the instability remains unchanged. Therefore, the minimal instability will be achieved by either removing the smallest element or the largest element (or both, if duplicates exist).\n\n2. **Insight**: \n   - **Removing the Smallest Element**: If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest element, removing one occurrence leaves the smallest element still present, so the minimum value remains the same. Otherwise, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element.\n   - **Removing the Largest Element**: Similarly, if there are multiple occurrences of the largest element, removing one does not change the maximum value. Otherwise, the new maximum becomes the next largest element.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate two candidate values:\n     - **Candidate 1**: The instability after removing the smallest element.\n     - **Candidate 2**: The instability after removing the largest element.\n   - The answer is the minimum of these two candidates.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent checks are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    m = n\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(0)\n    elif m == 1:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        if a[0] == a[1]:\n            cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n        else:\n            cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n            \n        if a[-1] == a[-2]:\n            cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n        else:\n            cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n            \n        print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Directly handles cases where the array has only one element (though the problem states n ≥ 2, it's included for completeness).\n4. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Candidate 1**: Checks if the smallest element appears more than once. If yes, removing one instance doesn't change the minimum, so the instability remains the original range. Otherwise, the new minimum is the second smallest element.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Similarly checks the largest element. If duplicates exist, the instability stays the same; otherwise, the new maximum is the second largest element.\n5. **Result**: The minimum of the two candidates is printed, representing the least possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting for optimal performance.",
