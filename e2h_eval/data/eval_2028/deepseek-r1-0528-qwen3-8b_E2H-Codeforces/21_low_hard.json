The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) and one of m integers (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open a chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning they must have opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd.\n   If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\n We can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups: \n      even_chests: where a_i % 2 == 0\n      odd_chests: where a_i % 2 == 1\n\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups:\n      even_keys: where b_j % 2 == 0\n      odd_keys: where b_j % 2 == 1\n\n 3. Now, an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n 4. Therefore, we can form two bipartite matchings (or simply use greedy matching since each chest and key can be used at most once) but note:\n\n    - The even_chests require odd_keys, and odd_chests require even_keys.\n\n 5. However, we cannot use the same key twice. So we can think of:\n\n    Let E1 = number of even_chests\n    Let O1 = number of odd_chests\n\n    Let E2 = number of even_keys\n    Let O2 = number of odd_keys\n\n 6. But note: the condition is strict. The even_chests must use odd_keys and odd_chests must use even_keys.\n\n 7. The maximum matching is limited by the minimum of the two sides for each bipartition.\n\n    Specifically, for the even_chests and odd_keys: we can open at most min(E1, O2) chests from the even_chests side.\n    Similarly, for the odd_chests and even_keys: we can open at most min(O1, E2) chests from the odd_chests side.\n\n 8. Then the total maximum chests we can open is min(E1, O2) + min(O1, E2).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        even_chests: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        odd_chests: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n        even_keys: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        odd_keys: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then:\n        even_chests (3) can be matched with odd_keys (1): min(3,1)=1\n        odd_chests (2) can be matched with even_keys (3): min(2,3)=2\n\n   Total: 1+2 = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E1=5, O1=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O2=1, E2=0\n\n   Then: min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0 -> total 1.\n\n Third example: \n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest: 1, odd_chest:0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E2=4, O2=0\n   Then: min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total 0.\n\n But wait, what if there are multiple keys and chests? The above reasoning is correct because:\n\n   Condition for even_chest: requires odd key -> so without any odd keys, no even_chest can be opened.\n   Condition for odd_chest: requires even key -> so without even keys, no odd_chest can be opened.\n\n However, note that one key is used for one chest and vice versa. The above calculation does not overcount because we are using two separate independent sets.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the next line for chests, then the next for keys.\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Then compute:\n        part1 = min(count_even_chests, count_odd_keys)\n        part2 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to requiring one even and one odd number between a chest and a key. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - **Chests**: Divide them into two groups—those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - **Keys**: Similarly, divide them into two groups—those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n\n2. **Matching Based on Parity**:\n   - **Even-numbered Chests**: These require odd-numbered keys to open. The maximum number of such chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even-numbered chests and the count of odd-numbered keys.\n   - **Odd-numbered Chests**: These require even-numbered keys to open. The maximum number of such chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd-numbered chests and the count of even-numbered keys.\n\n3. **Summing the Results**: The total number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the two maximum values obtained from the above steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    part1 = min(even_chest, odd_key)\n    part2 = min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    \n    result = part1 + part2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: For both chests and keys, we count how many have even and odd numbers.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: \n   - **Even Chests**: The number of even-numbered chests that can be opened is limited by the number of odd-numbered keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - **Odd Chests**: Similarly, the number of odd-numbered chests that can be opened is limited by the number of even-numbered keys.\n4. **Output the Result**: The sum of the two calculated values gives the maximum number of chests Neko can open, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal solution without complex computations, ensuring it handles the upper constraint limits effectively.",
