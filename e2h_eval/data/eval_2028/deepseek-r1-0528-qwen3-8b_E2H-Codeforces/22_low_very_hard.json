After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means having the highest mark in that subject).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? But note the problem says \"best\" if no student has a higher mark.\n    So, if two or more have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n However, note: we cannot simply take the maximum per subject because we need to know the maximum per subject and then check for each student if in at least one subject they have that maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Create a matrix (list of lists) of integers from the input strings.\n   - For each subject j (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student i, check if for any subject j, the student's mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\n But note: the input is given as strings of digits, so we can convert each character to an integer.\n\n However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, and the input is given without spaces.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n Let me break down the first example:\n\n   n=3, m=3\n   grades = [\n        [2,2,3],\n        [2,3,2],\n        [1,1,2]\n   ]\n\n   For subject0: max is 2 -> so student0 and student1 have 2 (so both are best in subject0)\n   For subject1: max is 3 -> only student1 has 3\n   For subject2: max is 3 -> student0 has 3? Actually wait: \n        student0: [2,2,3] -> subject2: 3\n        student1: [2,3,2] -> subject2: 2\n        student2: [1,1,2] -> subject2: 2\n        So max for subject2 is 3, so only student0 is best in subject2.\n\n   Now, which students are successful?\n        Student0: has best in subject0 (because 2 is the max) and subject2 (because 3 is the max) -> successful.\n        Student1: has best in subject1 (because 3 is the max) and also subject0? But wait: in subject0, the mark is 2 and the max is 2, so yes. \n                  So student1 is best in subject0 and subject1 -> successful.\n        Student2: does not have any subject with the maximum. In subject0: 1 < 2 -> not best. subject1: 1 < 3 -> not best. subject2: 2 < 3 -> not best.\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse input.\n   Step 2: Convert the n x m grid into a grid of integers.\n\n   Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n        max_mark = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check if there exists at least one j such that grid[i][j] == max_mark for column j.\n\n   But note: the grid is given as strings. We can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid_str = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            grid_str.append(s)\n\n        # Then create a grid of integers?\n        grid_int = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = [int(ch) for ch in grid_str[i]]\n            grid_int.append(row)\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid converting the entire grid to integers by processing as characters? \n   But then the max comparison for characters is lexicographical (which is same as numerical since '1'<'2'<...<'9').\n\n   However, to be safe, we can do:\n\n        Option 1: use integers.\n\n   Step 5: For each column, compute the maximum value (as integer) and store in a list `max_per_subject` of length m.\n\n   Step 6: Then, for each student i (each row), we check for any",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in each subject.\n2. **Mark Conversion**: Convert each character in the input strings to integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid_str = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid_str.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    grid_int = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [int(ch) for ch in grid_str[i]]\n        grid_int.append(row)\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = -1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid_int[i][j] > col_max:\n                col_max = grid_int[i][j]\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid_int[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the first line to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines are read as strings representing each student's marks.\n2. **Mark Conversion**: Each character in these strings is converted to an integer to allow numerical comparisons.\n3. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by scanning all student marks in that subject.\n4. **Successful Students Check**: For each student, the code checks if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Result Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine success, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
