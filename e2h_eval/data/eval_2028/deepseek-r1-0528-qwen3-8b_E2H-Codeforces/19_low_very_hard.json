The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. The president wants to remove k contestants (districts) such that the remaining districts form a connected component (i.e., a subtree) and the total fans (which is 2^district_index) is maximized.\n\n Since the value for a district i is 2^i, note that higher-indexed districts have exponentially more fans. Therefore, we want to keep as many high-indexed districts as possible.\n\n However, the condition is that the remaining districts must form a connected component. This means that if we remove some set of k districts, the remaining n-k districts must be connected by the original tree's edges (without crossing removed districts).\n\n Observation:\n - We are allowed to remove k districts, so we need to leave n-k districts.\n - The remaining set must be connected, meaning that in the original tree, the remaining set must form a connected subtree.\n\n How do we think about this?\n We can consider that the remaining connected component must be a subtree. In a tree, a connected subgraph is a subtree and it is uniquely determined by the set of edges we keep. Alternatively, we can think: which node (or set of nodes) should be included to maximize the sum?\n\n Note: The value 2^i grows very fast with i. So we definitely want to keep the highest-indexed districts as much as possible.\n\n However, there is a constraint: the remaining districts must form a connected component. So we cannot arbitrarily choose the high-indexed districts because they might not be connected.\n\n Alternate approach:\n We know that the entire nation is a tree. The remaining districts must form a connected component. Therefore, we can consider that the connected component is rooted at some node (which doesn't necessarily have to be the highest index) and then we can include all the nodes that are connected to it without crossing the removed ones.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the removals. We are to output k integers (the districts to remove) in increasing order.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the total number of nodes is n, and we remove k, so we keep n-k nodes.\n\n 2. Since the value for a node i is 2^i, which is increasing with i, we prefer to keep the largest indices. However, we cannot break connectivity.\n\n 3. We can also think: which connected component (of size n-k) has the maximum sum? Since the entire set of nodes is a tree, the connected component must be a subtree.\n\n 4. Another observation: In a tree, the maximum connected component (subtree) of size m (here m = n-k) must be one of the \"maximal\" subtrees. But note: we are allowed to choose any connected component of exactly n-k nodes.\n\n 5. However, note that we are forced to remove exactly k nodes. We are free to choose which k to remove as long as the remaining n-k nodes form a connected component.\n\n 6. We can use the following idea: \n    - We want to keep the highest-value nodes (i.e., the largest indices) and as many as possible, but we must form a connected component.\n\n 7. Let's reframe: Instead of thinking about removals, think about the connected component we wish to keep. We wish to maximize the sum, so we want to include the highest-indexed nodes. But we cannot break the connectivity.\n\n 8. We can consider the following: \n    - The entire tree is given. We can root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1). Then, the connected component must be a set of nodes that is connected and includes a contiguous set of edges.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem is difficult because n can be up to 10^6 and k up to 10^6.\n\n 10. We can use the following greedy idea:\n\n     We know that the best candidate is to keep the highest-indexed nodes. But how do we form a connected component from the highest-indexed nodes?\n\n     Let S be the set of nodes we wish to keep. Then S must be connected.\n\n     We can try to start from the highest-indexed node and then include all the nodes that are necessary to connect it to other high-indexed nodes? But note: we are allowed to choose any connected set.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the concept of \"union of paths\" or \"tree dynamic programming\", but note that n is up to 10^6 and k is up to 10^6, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n 12. Insight: Since the value 2^i grows so fast, the optimal set of kept nodes will be the set of the n-k largest-indexed nodes that form a connected component. But note: sometimes we cannot take all the n-k largest because they might not be connected. \n\n     Example: n=6, k=3, so",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts (contestants) should be removed from a tree-structured network such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected component and the sum of their fan values (2^i for district i) is maximized. The solution involves leveraging the properties of trees and greedy selection to efficiently identify the optimal districts to keep.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total fan value. Therefore, the optimal solution will prioritize keeping the highest-numbered districts as much as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n2. **Tree Structure Insight**: The original districts form a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts. The remaining districts must form a connected subtree, which implies they must include all nodes along the paths connecting them.\n3. **Greedy Selection**: We start by considering the highest-numbered districts and check if they can be part of a connected component of size n-k. This involves traversing the tree to see if including these districts maintains connectivity.\n4. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to manage connected components efficiently. For each district, we check if including it in the connected component would exceed the desired size (n-k). If not, we merge its parent with the current component.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000000)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k_remove = int(data[1])\n    m = n - k_remove\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        u = int(data[index])\n        v = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    parent = [0] * (n+1)\n    depth = [0] * (n+1)\n    order = []\n    stack = [1]\n    parent[1] = 0\n    while stack:\n        node = stack.pop()\n        order.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            parent[neighbor] = node\n            depth[neighbor] = depth[node] + 1\n            stack.append(neighbor)\n            \n    sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: (-x, -depth[x]))\n    \n    uf = list(range(n+1))\n    rank = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    def find(x):\n        if uf[x] != x:\n            uf[x] = find(uf[x])\n        return uf[x]\n    \n    def union(x, y):\n        rx = find(x)\n        ry = find(y)\n        if rx == ry:\n            return False\n        if rank[rx] < rank[ry]:\n            uf[rx] = ry\n        elif rank[rx] > rank[ry]:\n            uf[ry] = rx\n        else:\n            uf[ry] = rx\n            rank[rx] += 1\n        return True\n\n    kept = set()\n    for node in sorted_nodes:\n        if len(kept) >= m:\n            break\n        if node not in kept:\n            if find(node) not in kept:\n                union(node, parent[node])\n                kept.add(node)\n            else:\n                kept.add(node)\n    removals = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i not in kept][:k_remove]\n    removals.sort()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, removals)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k_remove). The tree structure is then built using adjacency lists.\n2. **Tree Traversal**: A DFS traversal starting from district 1 is performed to compute parent and depth arrays, which help in ordering the districts.\n3. **Node Sorting**: Districts are sorted in descending order based on their numbers and depth to prioritize higher-numbered districts and those closer to the root.\n4. **Union-Find Data Structure**: This structure helps efficiently manage and merge connected components. For each district in the sorted list, we check if merging it with its parent keeps the component size within the desired limit (n-k_remove).\n5. **Removal Calculation**: After processing all relevant districts, the remaining districts to remove are those not in the kept set, sorted in ascending order, and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the fan value sum by prioritizing high-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity through efficient union operations. The complexity is kept manageable using DFS and union-find, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
