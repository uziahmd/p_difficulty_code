They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has `2^n` teams. The string `s` describes the results for each phase (from the first phase to the nth phase) as follows:\n   - In phase i (0-indexed, so the first phase is phase 0), if `s[i]` is '0', then the lower skilled team wins in every match of that phase.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', then the higher skilled team wins.\n\n We need to find all integers `x` (which are team skill levels) for which there exists a permutation `p` (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) such that the team with skill `x` wins the tournament.\n\n Note: The tournament structure is fixed: the initial bracket is fixed (the matches are predetermined: the first two teams play, next two, etc.). However, the permutation `p` assigns the skill levels arbitrarily to these team indices.\n\n Observation: Since the bracket is fixed, we can think of the tournament as a complete binary tree of height `n` (with `2^n` leaves). The winner of the tournament is the team that survives all the rounds.\n\n However, note that the outcome of each round depends on the fixed rule (either by skill or by opposite) and the permutation of skills.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Instead of thinking about the entire permutation, note that the tournament is deterministic once the assignment of the numbers 1..(2^n) to the teams is fixed.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix the assignment of the teams to the bracket. We can assign arbitrarily.\n\n So, we are allowed to assign the numbers arbitrarily. We are to determine which numbers `x` can be the champion.\n\n How?\n\n Consider: We have 2^n teams, and we assign distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n The tournament goes through `n` rounds (phases). In each round, the matches are predetermined (by the bracket). The rule for each round is given by the corresponding character in `s`.\n\n In a round with `m = 2^k` teams (so k is the phase index, starting from 0 for the first round with 2^(n-0)=2^n teams? Actually, note: the first phase has 2^n teams and produces 2^(n-1) winners. Then the second phase has 2^(n-1) teams and produces 2^(n-2) winners, until the last phase (phase n-1) which has 2^1 teams and produces 1 winner.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\"\n   So, the first phase (i=0) has 2^{n-0} = 2^n teams? Actually, wait: the first phase has 2^n teams and plays 2^(n-1) games (each game eliminates one team). Then the next phase (i=1) has 2^(n-1) teams and plays 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n But note: the problem says the first phase has 2^(n-1) games (so 2^n teams). Then the second phase (if any) has 2^(n-2) games (so 2^(n-1) teams) and so on.\n\n However, note: the total number of games is 2^n - 1, and the phases are from the largest group down.\n\n We can model the tournament as a complete binary tree of `n` levels (excluding the root). Each node represents a match, and the children are the two teams that played in that match.\n\n Now, the key: we are free to assign the numbers 1 to 2^n arbitrarily to the leaves (and then the internal nodes are determined by the outcome of the match).\n\n Conditions for a team (with skill x) to win:\n\n Let the leaf corresponding to the champion be labeled by the skill `x`. Then, we must assign the other numbers arbitrarily to the other leaves.\n\n The outcome of each match is determined by the rule of the phase (the level at which the match occurs) and the relative ordering of the two numbers in that match.\n\n However, note: the bracket is fixed. The matches are fixed: the first two teams (leaves) play in the first round (first phase) to determine the winner of that subtree, then that winner meets the winner of the next two, etc.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that the entire tournament has `n` rounds (from round 0 to round n-1). In round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the rule is given by `s[i]`. The round i is played on `2^(n-i)` teams (wait, actually the round i is the phase i, and the number of games in that phase is 2^(n-i) ???)\n\n Let me clarify: \n   - The first phase (i=0) has 2^n teams and 2^(n-1) games.\n   - The second phase (i=1) has 2^(n-1) teams and 2^(n-2) games.\n\n So the number of games in phase i is 2^(n-i-1) ? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"in the first phase, the teams are split into pairs: so 2^(n-1) games\"\n\n And then \"if only one team remains, the second phase begins, with 2^(n-2) games\".\n\n Therefore, the phase i (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games? Actually, no: the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, so the number of games in phase i is 2^(n-i-1) for i from 0 to n-1? \n\n But wait: the total number of games is 2^n - 1, and indeed: \n   Sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^(n-i-1) = 2^(n-1) + 2^(n-2) + ... + 1 = 2^n - 1.\n\n However, the description of the bracket: \n   In the first phase, we have 2^n teams, and they play 2^(n-1) games (so 2^(n-1) matches). Then the second phase has 2^(n-1) teams, and they play 2^(n-2) games.\n\n So the phase i (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games? Actually, no: the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, which is 2^(n-0-1) = 2^(n-1) -> yes.\n\n But wait, the problem says the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games? Let me check: \n   It says: \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\" -> but wait, 2^{n-i} is the number of teams? Or the number of games?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 vs 2, team 3 vs 4, ... so 2^(n-1) games\". \n\n Then in the second phase, the number of games is 2^(n-2). \n\n So the number of games in phase i is 2^(n-i-1). However, the problem says: \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\" -> wait, that would be 2^(n-i) games. \n\n Let me reexamine: \n   First phase (i=0): 2^{n-0} = 2^n games? But we just said it's 2^(n-1) games.\n\n Correction: the problem says \"the phase with 2^{n-i} games\" is incorrect because the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, not 2^n. \n\n Actually, reading the problem again: \n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games.\"\n   \"after that, only 2^{n-1} teams remain\"\n   Then the second phase: \"2^{n-2} games\"\n\n So the i-th phase (starting from i=0) has 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n But the problem says: \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n Let me read carefully: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\"\n\n Wait, the problem says \"the phase with 2^{n-i} games\", meaning the number of games in the i-th phase is 2^(n-i). \n\n Then for the first phase (i=0): 2^(n) games? That would mean 2^n games, but we start with 2^n teams and we need 2^(n-1) games to reduce to 2^(n-1) teams.\n\n There's a contradiction.\n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"2\\n01\"\n\n   Output: \"2 3\"\n\n   What does this mean? n=2, so 4 teams. The string s=\"01\".\n\n   According to the problem, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(2-0)=4 games? Then we would have 4 teams playing 4 games? But 4 teams can only play 3 games to get one champion? \n\n Alternatively, maybe the indexing is off. The problem says:\n\n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\"\n\n   Then the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-0)=2^n games? But we only have 2^n teams, and each game requires two teams, and we cannot have more than 2^(n-1) games in the first phase (because we eliminate one per game).\n\n So I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n Let me compare with the example: \n   Example: n=2, s=\"01\"\n\n   The tournament has 4 teams. The first phase: 2^(2-1)=2 games? Then the second phase: 2^(2-2)=1 game.\n\n   But the problem says the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games. For i=0: 2^(2-0)=4, which is too many.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \n\n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games.\"\n\n   Then the first phase: 2^(n-1) games, second phase: 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n   So the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\" -> that would be 2^(n-i) games, which is not matching.\n\n   Unless the problem meant: the i-th phase (counting from 0) is the one that will have 2^(n-i) teams? Then the number of games in that phase is 2^(n-i) / 2 = 2^(n-i-1). \n\n   However, the problem explicitly says \"the phase with 2^{n-i} games\", so that is the number of games.\n\n   This discrepancy suggests that the problem statement might have an error.\n\n   Let me check the example output: \n\n        Input: \"2\\n01\" -> Output: \"2 3\"\n\n        n=2, so 4 teams. The bracket:\n\n          Round 0 (first phase): \n            Match1: Team1 vs Team2\n            Match2: Team3 vs Team4\n\n          Then the second phase (round 1):\n            Match3: Winner of Match1 vs Winner of Match2\n\n        The string s=\"01\": \n          In the first phase (round0, i=0): s[0]=='0' -> lower skill wins.\n          In the second phase (round1, i=1): s[1]=='1' -> higher skill wins.\n\n        We are to determine which x can be the champion.\n\n        The numbers 1,2,3,4 are assigned arbitrarily to the four teams.\n\n        How can team 2 win?\n          Scenario for x=2:\n\n          We want the team with skill 2 to win.\n\n          In round0 (lower wins): \n            The two matches: \n              In match1: between two teams. One of them must be 2. But note: the assignment is arbitrary. We can assign the numbers arbitrarily.\n\n          However, note: the bracket is fixed (teams 1,2,3,4 in order). But we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to these four teams.\n\n          So we can assign the four numbers arbitrarily to the four teams.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n          We require that the champion is the team with skill 2.\n\n          Round0 (lower wins): \n            The two matches are independent. The winners of the two matches are the two smallest numbers in their respective matches.\n\n            Then the second round: higher wins.\n\n          To have 2 win, we must have 2 survive both rounds.\n\n          In the first round, 2 must win its first match. Then in the second match, 2 must beat the winner of the other first-round match.\n\n          For the first match (teams 1 and 2): \n            The two numbers assigned to these two teams. Let the two numbers be a and b.\n\n            Since the rule is 0 (lower wins), then the winner is min(a,b).\n\n            We require that 2 is the winner of this match, so 2 must be the smallest number in the two teams of this match.\n\n            But note: we have four numbers: 1,2,3,4.\n\n            So one possibility: assign 2 and a number greater than 2 (say 3 or 4) to the first match. Then 2 wins.\n\n          Then the second match (teams 3 and 4): \n            The two numbers assigned to these two teams must be the remaining two numbers. The winner of this match (with rule 1, higher wins) must be the maximum of the two.\n\n          Then the final match (rule 1, higher wins): \n            We have 2 (from the first match) and the maximum of the second match.\n\n          Condition for 2 to win: \n            In the final, since the rule is higher wins, we require that the maximum of the second match is less than 2? \n            But the numbers are 1,2,3,4. The remaining numbers are the two that are not used in the first match. \n\n          Actually, we have used 2 and one other number (say 3) in the first match. Then the second match uses 1 and 4.\n\n          Then the winner of the second match is max(1,4)=4 (since rule is higher wins).\n\n          Then the final match: 2 vs 4, with rule higher wins -> 4 wins, so 2 is not the champion.\n\n          Alternatively, assign the first match: 2 and 1. Then the first match: min(1,2)=1 -> so 1 wins, and then we have 1 and the winner of the other match (which is max(3,4)=4). Then 1 vs 4: higher wins -> 4 wins.\n\n          Alternatively, assign the first match: 2 and 4. Then the first match: min(2,4)=2 wins. The second match: the remaining numbers are 1 and 3 -> max(1,3)=3. Then the final: 2 vs 3, higher wins -> 3 wins.\n\n          Alternatively, assign the first match: 2 and 3. Then the first match: min(2,3)=2 wins. The second match: 1 and 4 -> max(1,4)=4. Then final: 2 vs 4 -> higher wins: 4 wins.\n\n          So how can 2 win?\n\n          We must have 2 win the first match, and then in the final, we must have 2 be the highest. But the other half of the bracket must have a number that is less than 2? But the only number less than 2 is 1.\n\n          So assign the second match: 1 and 4? Then the winner of the second match is 4 (higher wins). Then 2 vs 4: 4 is higher, so 4 wins.\n\n          Alternatively, what if we assign the second match: 1 and 3? Then the winner is 3 (higher wins). Then 2 vs 3: 3 wins.\n\n          Alternatively, assign the second match: 1 and 2? But wait, 2 is already used.\n\n          Wait, we have four distinct numbers: 1,2,3,4.\n\n          The key: we must assign the numbers arbitrarily. But note: the two halves of the bracket are fixed: the first two teams and the next two.\n\n          The only way for 2 to win is to have 2 in the first match and also have the entire other half of the bracket have numbers that are all less than 2? But the only number less than 2 is 1. So we assign 1 to the other half, and then the other two numbers (3 and 4) must be placed in the first half? But wait, we have two slots in the first half: we have to put 2 and one other. We put 2 and 1 in the first half? Then the first match: min(1,2)=1 -> 1 wins, and then 1 goes to the final.\n\n          Alternatively, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the four teams. The problem doesn't fix the assignment of the bracket's initial teams.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4\". But we can assign the skill levels arbitrarily to these team labels.\n\n          So we can choose which skill goes to which team.\n\n          Therefore, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the four teams. Then we can choose:\n\n          Option 1: \n            Team1: 1, Team2: 2, Team3: 3, Team4: 4.\n\n          Option 2: \n            Team1: 2, Team2: 1, Team3: 3, Team4: 4.\n\n          Option 3: \n            Team1: 2, Team2: 3, Team3: 1, Team4: 4.\n\n          etc.\n\n          Now, let's try:\n\n          To make 2 win, we need 2 to be the champion.\n\n          The first round (rule 0: lower wins) for the two matches:\n\n            Match1: Team1 vs Team2 -> the winner is the minimum of the two numbers.\n            Match2: Team3 vs Team4 -> the winner is the minimum of the two numbers.\n\n          Then the second round (rule 1: higher wins):\n\n            Winner of Match1 vs Winner of Match2.\n\n          We require that 2 wins both the second round and the first round.\n\n          How?\n\n          In the first round, 2 must be the minimum in its match. So in its match, the other number must be greater than 2.\n\n          Then, the winner of the other match must be a number that is less than 2 (so that in the second round, when the rule is higher wins, 2 beats it). The only number less than 2 is 1.\n\n          So we must have:\n\n            In the first match (where 2 is): the other number is >2 (so 3 or 4).\n            In the second match: the two numbers must include 1 and the remaining number (which is either 3 or 4, whichever wasn't chosen).\n\n          Then, the winner of the second match (rule 0: lower wins) is the minimum of the two numbers in the second match.\n\n          We require that the winner of the second match is 1 (so that in the second round, 2 beats 1). So the two numbers in the second match must be 1 and (a number >=1). The minimum is 1.\n\n          Then, the second round: 2 vs 1 -> rule 1: higher wins -> 2 wins.\n\n          So assign:\n\n            First match: 2 and 3 (for example). Then the first match winner is 2.\n            Second match: 1 and 4 -> winner is 1 (min(1,4)).\n\n          Then the final: 2 vs 1 -> higher wins -> 2 wins.\n\n          This works.\n\n          Similarly, we can assign:\n\n            First match: 2 and 4 -> winner 2.\n            Second match: 1 and 3 -> winner 1.\n\n          Then the final: 2 vs 1 -> 2 wins.\n\n          Also, we can assign:\n\n            First match: 2 and 3 -> winner 2.\n            Second match: 1 and 4 -> winner 1.\n\n          So the conditions for x to win:\n\n            The team with skill x must be in a position (leaf) such that:\n\n            In every round (from the round where it is present until the final), the outcome must be favorable.\n\n            Specifically, we can traverse the bracket from the leaf up to the root, and at each node (match) we know the rule (given by s for the corresponding phase).\n\n            For the path from the leaf to the root, we have a sequence of rounds (each round is a phase). The rule for the round at depth d (or at the node) is given by s[d] (but note: the rounds are from the first round (largest bracket) to the last round (smallest bracket). \n\n            However, the bracket is fixed: the first round is the first set of matches, then the second, etc.\n\n            The leaf is at the bottom (round n-1, the last round being the final). But wait, the first round is the one with the most teams. \n\n            Actually, the bracket:\n\n                Round0 (first phase): matches are between consecutive pairs: (team1,team2), (team3,team4), ... (team(2^(n-1)-1, team(2^(n-1)))\n\n                Then the next round: the winners of (team1,team2) and (team3,team4) play, then (team5,team6) and (team7,team8), etc.\n\n            The leaf (the team) is identified by its initial position.\n\n            The condition for a particular leaf to be the champion is that, for every match along the path from the leaf to the root, the outcome must be such that the leaf's number is the one that wins.\n\n            In a match (node) at a certain phase i (0-indexed from the first phase as i=0) we know the rule: if s[i]=='0', then the lower number wins; if '1', the higher number wins.\n\n            Now, note: the leaf is one of the two teams in the match. The other team in the match is the one from the opposite side of the bracket. However, we can assign arbitrarily the numbers to the leaves. \n\n            But the catch: the entire assignment must be a permutation. So we have to consider the entire set.\n\n            Alternate Insight:\n\n            We can consider that the tournament is a set of comparisons. The champion must beat every other team in a sequence of comparisons, but the comparisons occur in specific rounds and the rules change.\n\n            However, note: the bracket is fixed, and the rule for each round (match) is fixed. The champion must win all the matches, and the opponents it faces are determined by the bracket and the outcomes.\n\n            But we can assign arbitrarily the numbers. So we are effectively asking: for a given x, is there an assignment of the numbers 1..(2^n) to the leaves such that when we simulate the tournament (with the fixed bracket and the fixed rules for each round) the champion is x?\n\n            Conditions for x to be the champion:\n\n            Let the path from the leaf (with x) to the root be defined. Along this path, there are several matches (nodes). At each node (at a particular round i, which corresponds to the rule s[i]), the two teams that meet at that node must satisfy:\n\n                If the rule at that round is '0' (lower wins), then x must be the smaller number than the other team that reaches that node (i.e., the winner of the opposite subtree).\n\n                If the rule at that round is '1' (higher wins), then x must be the larger number than the other team that reaches that node.\n\n            However, the other team that reaches that node is the winner of the opposite subtree. And we can assign arbitrarily the numbers to the entire set of leaves.\n\n            But note: the assignments must be distinct and cover all numbers.\n\n            We can use a recursive/dynamic programming approach or think greedily:\n\n            The idea: we know the set of numbers that are available. The champion must be the largest number if all the rules are '1'? Or the smallest if all are '0'? Not exactly.\n\n            We can traverse the bracket from the leaf (x) upward and determine the constraints on the numbers in the opposite subtree.\n\n            For the champion to win at a node (with rule c) against an opponent (which is the winner of the opposite subtree), we require:\n\n                if c == '0': x < opponent\n                if c == '1': x > opponent\n\n            But note: the opponent is the maximum (if the rule is '1') or minimum (if the rule is '0') of the entire opposite subtree? \n\n            Actually, the entire opposite subtree is a set of leaves. The outcome of that subtree is determined by the rules in that subtree. \n\n            However, we can control the assignment arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign numbers arbitrarily to the leaves. \n\n            The minimal requirement for x to win is:\n\n            Let the entire set of leaves be L = {1,2,...,2^n}. We remove x from L, and we must assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n            The bracket can be represented as a complete binary tree. The champion's path has n matches (one per round). The entire tournament is fixed.\n\n            We can define:\n\n                Let F(node) be the set of numbers that must be present in the subtree rooted at node for x to win, given the rules from this node to the leaves.\n\n            However, note: the rule for a node is given by the phase index. The phase index for a node is determined by its depth (or level). The root is the last round (phase n-1) and the leaves are phase 0? \n\n            Actually, the first phase (the first round) is the one with the most teams (2^n teams) and the rule is s[0]. The next round (phase 1) has 2^(n-1) teams and rule s[1], etc.\n\n            The match at the root is the final, which is phase n-1 (so the rule is s[n-1]). \n\n            But wait, the problem indexes the string s from 0 to n-1, and the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games? \n\n            We clarified earlier: the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games (so 2^n teams) and the rule is s[0]. The second phase (i=1) has 2^(n-2) games (so 2^(n-1) teams) and the rule is s[1].\n\n            Now, the bracket: the first round (phase0) is the first set of matches, then the second round (phase1) is the next set, until the final (phase n-1).\n\n            The champion's path goes through n rounds (from round0 to round n-1). The rounds are from the bottom (the leaves) to the top (the root). Actually, the rounds are from the first round (largest) to the last round (final). \n\n            But the rule for the first round (when there are 2^n teams) is s[0]. The rule for the final (when there are 2 teams) is s[n-1].\n\n            Now, to determine the necessary conditions for x:\n\n            We can do a DFS/BFS from the root downward? But we are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider that the entire set of numbers must be partitioned into two sets for each match: the champion's side and the opponent's side. And the condition for a match is that the champion must be the winner (according to the rule) against the best (if rule is '1') or worst (if rule is '0') of the opponent's side.\n\n            However, we can use a greedy method:\n\n            We know that the champion must be the overall maximum if the last rule (the final) is '1'. But if the final rule is '0', then the champion must be the overall minimum? Not necessarily, because the previous rounds might force the opponent to be very high or very low.\n\n            Another approach: \n\n            Let the champion be x. Then, for the champion to win a match at a node (with rule c) against an opponent y, we require:\n\n                if c=='0': x < y\n                if c=='1': x > y\n\n            But note: y is the winner of the opposite subtree. The opposite subtree has a certain set of numbers. We can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the numbers in the opposite subtree arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and from the set excluding x).\n\n            However, the condition must hold for every match. And the set of numbers that end up in the opposite subtree must be consistent.\n\n            We can think of the bracket as requiring that at each node (from the champion's leaf upward) the champion must be able to beat the entire opposite subtree's winner. \n\n            The key: the entire set of numbers is fixed. The champion must be compared to a set of numbers (the ones that are eliminated by the champion and the ones that are in the champion's path) but actually, the champion must be greater than (if rule is '1') or less than (if rule is '0') the winner of the opposite subtree.\n\n            But note: the opposite subtree is built from a set of leaves. The outcome of that subtree is determined by the rules in that subtree.\n\n            However, we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the numbers in the opposite subtree to be as favorable as possible.\n\n            For a given node (with rule c) and the champion's value x, the minimal requirement for the entire opposite subtree is:\n\n                If c=='0' (lower wins in the entire subtree): then the winner of the opposite subtree is the minimum number in that subtree. Then we require x < min(opposite_subtree).\n\n                If c=='1' (higher wins in the entire subtree): then the winner of the opposite subtree is the maximum number in that subtree. Then we require x > max(opposite_subtree).\n\n            But wait, is that correct?\n\n            Consider: if the rule in the entire subtree is '0' (all lower wins), then the winner is the smallest number in that subtree. Then we require x to be less than that smallest number.\n\n            Similarly, if the rule is '1' (all higher wins), then the winner is the largest number in that subtree, so we require x to be greater than that largest number.\n\n            However, note: the subtree may have multiple rounds, and the rule for each round is given by s (but the rule for the entire subtree is not uniform? Actually, the rule for each round is given by the phase index. The subtree has a fixed set of rounds (from the current node to the leaves). The rule for each round is stored in the string s at the corresponding phase.\n\n            But note: the rule for the rounds in the opposite subtree are given by the same string s, but the phases are different (because the phase index i corresponds to the round number, and the opposite subtree is at a lower level?).\n\n            Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds (phases). The champion's path goes through n rounds (from round0 to round n-1). The opposite subtree at a node at round i (meaning the node is at the beginning of a subtree that will play i rounds) has a set of leaves of size 2^i.\n\n            However, the rule for the rounds in the opposite subtree are the same as the overall s? \n\n            The problem states: the i-th phase (the one with 2^(n-i) games) has rule s[i]. \n\n            The rounds (phases) are fixed: the first phase (largest) is phase0, then phase1, etc.\n\n            The opposite subtree at a node that is at phase j (meaning it is the j-th phase from the bottom) is actually the (n-1-j)-th phase? \n\n            Actually, the root is the final (phase n-1). The next level down is the semifinals (phase n-2), etc.\n\n            But wait, the problem indexes the string s from 0 to n-1, and the i-th phase (which is the phase with 2^(n-i) games) is the one that occurs first (with the largest number of teams). \n\n            The bracket:\n\n                Phase0 (i=0): 2^(n-0)=2^n teams -> the first round (most teams)\n                Phase1 (i=1): 2^(n-1) teams\n                ...\n                Phasen-1 (i=n-1): 2^1 teams -> the final.\n\n            Therefore, the rule for the final (the root) is s[n-1].\n\n            Now, the champion's first match is in phase0 (if n>0). Then the next match is in phase1, and so on until the final (phasen-1).\n\n            The opposite subtree for the champion's first match is the entire set of the other half of the bracket (size 2^(n-1)), and the rule for that entire subtree is given by the rules from phase1 to phase n-1? \n\n            Actually, no: the first match (phase0) is the first elimination. Then the next match (phase1) is the next elimination, and so on.\n\n            The entire tournament is predetermined: the rounds are fixed and the rules are fixed.\n\n            Therefore, for the champion to win, we must have:\n\n            Let the champion's leaf be at the bottom. Then, moving upward:\n\n                Round0 (phase0): the champion must win its first match. The rule is s[0]. The other team in the first match is the one from the adjacent leaf. Then, the champion must be the winner of the first match. \n\n                But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the numbers in the champion's own match arbitrarily. However, the entire set must be assigned.\n\n            We can use a recursive function that, given a set of numbers and a set of rules (from a given node to the leaves) and the required outcome (whether the champion must be greater or smaller than the entire subtree), we determine the minimal and maximal numbers that the champion must have.\n\n            However, note: we are given that the champion is x. We want to know if there exists an assignment such that x wins.\n\n            Alternatively, we can determine the set of numbers that must be excluded from the champion's side and included in the opponent's side.\n\n            Insight:\n\n            The champion must be the unique number that is not eliminated. The elimination happens by the rules.\n\n            We can consider the following: \n\n            The tournament is a sequence of comparisons. The champion must be greater than (if rule is '1') or less than (if rule is '0') the number it meets at each round. But note: the number it meets at a given round is the winner of the opposite subtree.\n\n            However, we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, the minimal requirement is:\n\n            Let the champion's path have n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the rule is s[i] (because the first round is phase0, then phase1, etc. until the final phase n-1).\n\n            Then, the champion must be:\n\n                In round0: \n                    if s[0]=='0': the champion must be the minimum of its two-team match.\n                    if s[0]=='1': the champion must be the maximum of its two-team match.\n\n            Then, in round1 (if any), the champion must be:\n\n                    if s[1]=='0': the champion must be the minimum of its two-team match (which now includes the winner from the previous round and the winner from the next two teams).\n                    if s[1]=='1': the champion must be the maximum.\n\n            But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed. The champion's number x must be either very large or very small depending on the rules.\n\n            Specifically, we can consider the following:\n\n                Let A0 be the set of numbers that are forced to be in the champion's side (initially none) and B0 the set of numbers that are forced to be in the opponent's side.\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute the minimal and maximal values that the champion must have to win:\n\n            Let m0 = 2^n (the total number of teams)\n\n            We can define:\n\n                Let low = 1, high = 2^n.\n\n            Then, for the champion to win, we must have:\n\n                In round0: \n                    if s[0]=='0': then the champion must be the smallest in its first match. Therefore, the other team in the first match must be > x. But we can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we don't care about the immediate opponent as long as we can assign the entire set.\n\n            However, the entire set must be assigned. The condition for the champion to win the tournament is that, for every round i (0-indexed), the champion must be the winner of the match at that round.\n\n            The minimal requirement is:\n\n                In round i, the champion must be the winner of the match. This means:\n\n                    if s[i]=='0': x must be less than the winner of the opposite subtree (which is the minimum of the entire",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skills \\( p \\) (a bijection from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 2^n \\)) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament follows specific rules for each phase, where in phase \\( i \\), if the character \\( s[i] \\) is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams arranged in a fixed bracket. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half, with each match following the rule specified by the corresponding character in the string \\( s \\). The challenge is to find all integers \\( x \\) that can be the champion under some permutation of skills.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team with skill \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must win all its matches in every phase. This requires that in each phase \\( i \\), depending on the rule \\( s[i] \\), \\( x \\) must be either the smallest or largest in its path to victory. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking for each integer \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) whether it can be the champion. For each \\( x \\), we simulate the tournament by ensuring that in each phase, \\( x \\) meets the required condition (being the minimum or maximum in its match) against the best possible opponent from the remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each number from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) (which is up to \\( 2^{18} = 262144 \\)) and for each number, processes up to \\( n \\) phases (up to 18 phases).
