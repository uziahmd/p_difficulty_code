String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of beautiful strings that can be formed by starting from a string (which initially has n zeros and m ones) and then performing a series of modifications until we get a string that ends with the given character g (or maybe the problem is about the final string having exactly n zeros and m ones, but note: the modifications change the string length and the counts).\n\n However, reading the problem again: \n \"String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:\n  - String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.\n  - We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\n But wait: the example input \"1 1 0\" gives output 2. The beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". \n\n How do we relate the modifications? The operation is defined as: replace two last characters by one (so the new character is 1 if the two were both 0, otherwise 0). This reduces the length by 1 each time.\n\n Note: the initial string must have n zeros and m ones, so the total length is n+m. After k operations, the length becomes n+m - k. And the condition for the beautiful string is that it must have exactly n zeros and m ones? Actually, the problem says: the beautiful string must have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"2 2 0\" -> Output: 4.\n\n In the second sample, the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\n But wait: the operation doesn't necessarily preserve the counts of zeros and ones. Let's see:\n\n Operation:\n   Replace two last characters by one:\n      If the two are \"00\", then the new char is '1'. Then we remove two zeros and add one '1': so zeros decrease by 2, ones increase by 1.\n      Similarly, \"01\" or \"10\": becomes '0'. Then we remove one 0 and one 1 and add one 0 -> zeros: -1, ones: -1, zeros net change: 0, ones net change: -1?\n      Actually, let's break down:\n          \"00\" -> becomes '1': zeros decrease by 2, ones increase by 1.\n          \"01\" -> becomes '0': zeros remain the same (we remove one 0 and one 1, then add one 0 -> zeros: -1+1 = 0; ones: -1)\n          \"10\" -> becomes '0': same as above.\n          \"11\" -> becomes '0': zeros increase by 1, ones decrease by 2.\n\n So the operation changes the counts. Therefore, the initial string must be of length n+m, and then we perform operations until we get a string of length 1? Or until we get the desired string?\n\n But note the problem: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" meaning that the beautiful string is the one that we end up with (and then we can modify to get g? Wait, actually the problem states:\n\n \"String s is beautiful if ... and we can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\n This is confusing. Let me re-read:\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings.\"\n\n Conditions for beautiful string s:\n   - It consists of 0 and 1.\n   - It has exactly n zeros and m ones.\n   - We can obtain the character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\n\n But note: the operation is defined on the string and reduces the length. However, the condition of having exactly n zeros and m ones is fixed for the entire process? \n\n Alternatively, let me consider the reverse process: Instead of starting from the initial string (which we don't know) and applying the operation, we start from the beautiful string (which has length n+m) and then apply the reverse operation (splitting) to get to a string that ends with g? Or maybe the problem means that we can take the beautiful string and then by a series of modifications we can get the character g (meaning the last character after some operations is g)? \n\n But the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" \n\n This might mean that from the beautiful string s, by doing the operations (which reduce the string) we can eventually get a string (of length 1) which is g. Or perhaps the problem allows us to stop at any time and the last character we leave is g? \n\n However, note: the modification operation is defined as replacing the two last characters. So the entire string is processed from the back? And we can stop at any time? \n\n The example: \n   Input: \"1 1 0\" -> beautiful strings: \"01\", \"10\".\n\n How can we get from \"01\" to obtain the character g=0?\n   We can do 0 modifications: then the last character is '1' (from \"01\") -> not 0.\n   Or one modification: take the two last (only two) characters: \"01\" -> becomes '0' (because not two zeros) -> then the string becomes \"0\", so the last character is 0.\n\n Similarly, for \"10\": \n   One modification: \"10\" -> becomes '0'.\n\n So the condition is that we can perform a sequence of modifications until the string length is 1 (because we cannot modify a string of length <2) and then the last character is g.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the beautiful string to have length 1. The beautiful string must have n zeros and m ones. Then from that beautiful string, we must be able to do a sequence of operations (each time taking the last two) until we get a single character which is g.\n\n However, the operation is always defined on the last two. So the entire string is reduced to a single character. Therefore, the beautiful string must be reducible to the character g by these operations.\n\n What is the reduction process? It's similar to a stack: \n   Start from the left? Actually, the operations are always on the last two, so the order of operations matters.\n\n Example: \"0011\" (n=2, m=2, g=0)\n   One way: \n        Step1: Take last two: \"11\" -> becomes '0', so string becomes \"000\"\n        Step2: Take last two: \"00\" -> becomes '1', so string becomes \"01\"\n        Step3: Take last two: \"01\" -> becomes '0', so string becomes \"0\"\n\n   Another way: \n        Step1: Take last two: \"01\" (if we consider the original string \"0011\", the last two are \"11\"? Actually, the original string is \"0011\", so last two are \"11\") -> same as above.\n\n   But note: the operations are defined as always taking the two last. So the order is fixed: from right to left.\n\n   However, we can choose to stop at any step? Actually, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" meaning that after some modifications (any number, including zero) the resulting string (which is the entire string after the last operation) must be g? Or the last character of the current string (which is of length>=2) might be g? \n\n   But note: the operation replaces two last characters by one. So after an operation, the string is shorter. The condition is that we can get g. Since we can stop at any time, we can stop when the last character (the one we are going to use for the next operation, or if we stop) is g? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify that we stop at the last character. It says \"obtain character g\", which might mean that the entire reduction process must end with g (i.e., we reduce until one character remains, and that one character is g). \n\n   Let me check the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"01\" (beautiful string) and g=0: \n        We reduce \"01\" to \"0\" (by one operation) and then we cannot reduce further. The last character is 0 -> so we can obtain g=0.\n\n   Example 2: \"01\" and g=1: \n        We reduce to \"0\", so we cannot obtain 1. Also, if we don't reduce, the last character is '1' (but the problem says \"with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications\", so zero modifications: then the string is \"01\", and the last character is '1'. But wait, is that allowed? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" \n\n   So if we do zero modifications, then the entire string s must be such that the last character is g? \n\n   But note: the beautiful string must have exactly n zeros and m ones. The condition for being beautiful includes that we can obtain g. \n\n   However, the example input: \"1 1 1\" -> output 0. \n\n   Why? Because the beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". \n        For \"01\": \n            With zero modifications: the last character is '1' -> so we can obtain g=1 by zero modifications. \n            But wait, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" \n            So for \"01\", we can obtain g=1 by zero modifications, so why is the answer 0?\n\n   There is a contradiction.\n\n   Let me reread the problem statement: \n        \"String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:\n          - String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.\n          - We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\n   And the example input: ['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1'].\n\n   The third sample: n=1, m=1, g=1 -> output 0.\n\n   So if we have the beautiful string \"01\", then we can obtain g=1 by zero modifications (since the last character is 1). Similarly, for \"10\", we can obtain g=1 by zero modifications (last character is 0? no, wait: \"10\" has last character '0').\n\n   Correction: for \"10\", the last character is '0'. So for g=1, we cannot obtain 1 by zero modifications because the last character is 0. But we can do one modification: \n        \"10\" -> replace the last two (which are \"10\") -> becomes '0'. Then the string is \"0\", and the last character is 0. \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"obtain character g\", which might mean that the entire reduction process (until we cannot reduce further) must end with g? Or we can stop at any operation and the last character of the current string (which is the one we left with) must be g?\n\n   The problem says: \"with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications\", meaning we can stop at any operation. So we can stop at the beginning (zero mods) or after one mod.\n\n   In the case of \"01\" and g=1: \n        Option 1: stop at zero mods: the string is \"01\", and the last character is '1' -> valid.\n        Option 2: do one mod: then we get \"0\", so the last character is 0 -> not valid.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"We can obtain character g\", meaning that there exists a way (a sequence of modifications, possibly stopping at any time) such that the last character is g.\n\n   For \"01\" and g=1: we can stop at zero mods and the last character is 1 -> valid.\n\n   For \"10\" and g=1: \n        Zero mods: last character is 0 -> invalid.\n        One mod: then the string becomes \"0\", last character is 0 -> invalid.\n        Two mods? Not possible because after one mod we have length 1 and cannot do more.\n\n   So \"10\" cannot yield g=1.\n\n   Now, what about the beautiful string \"01\" for g=0?\n        Zero mods: last character is 1 -> invalid.\n        One mod: becomes \"0\", last character is 0 -> valid.\n\n   So the beautiful string \"01\" is valid for g=0.\n\n   Similarly, for g=1, the beautiful string \"01\" is valid.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"1 1 1\" (n=1, m=1, g=1) has output 0. \n\n   That means there are no beautiful strings that satisfy: \n        Condition 1: exactly 1 zero and 1 one, and \n        Condition 2: we can obtain g=1 (by zero or more modifications).\n\n   We have two beautiful strings: \"01\" and \"10\".\n\n        \"01\": \n            Condition 2: valid (by zero mods).\n        \"10\":\n            Condition 2: not valid (by zero mods: last char is 0; by one mod: last char is 0).\n\n   So the beautiful string \"01\" is valid for g=1, and \"10\" is not. Then the answer should be 1, but the example output is 0.\n\n   This is conflicting.\n\n   Let me check the example provided: \n        Input: ['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n        Output: ['2', '4', '0']\n\n   So the third sample: n=1, m=1, g=1 -> 0.\n\n   Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\n   Alternative interpretation: \n\n   The problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\n   This might mean that the entire reduction process (until we cannot reduce further) must result in the character g.\n\n   In other words, the reduction of the beautiful string must end with g (i.e., the final character after reducing the entire string to length 1 is g).\n\n   Then for \"01\": \n        Reduction: \n            Operation on \"01\": becomes '0'. Then we have a string of length 1, so we stop. The final character is 0.\n\n        For g=1: we require the final character to be 1, but we got 0 -> invalid.\n\n        For g=0: valid.\n\n   For \"10\": \n        Operation on \"10\": becomes '0'. Final character 0.\n\n   Then for g=1: both beautiful strings yield 0 at the end, so none is valid -> output 0.\n\n   Similarly, for the first sample: n=1, m=1, g=0: \n        Both \"01\" and \"10\" reduce to '0', so both are valid -> output 2.\n\n   For the second sample: n=2, m=2, g=0: \n        The beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\"\n\n        We need to check the reduction of each:\n\n        \"0011\": \n            Operation on last two: \"11\" -> becomes '0'. Then the string becomes \"000\".\n            Then operation on last two: \"00\" -> becomes '1'. Then the string becomes \"01\".\n            Then operation on last two: \"01\" -> becomes '0'. Final: '0'\n\n        \"1001\":\n            Last two: \"01\" -> becomes '0'. Then string \"100\"\n            Then last two: \"00\" -> becomes '1'. Then string \"10\"\n            Then last two: \"10\" -> becomes '0'. Final: '0'\n\n        \"1010\":\n            Last two: \"10\" -> becomes '0'. Then string \"101\"\n            Then last two: \"01\" -> becomes '0'. Then string \"10\"\n            Then last two: \"10\" -> becomes '0'. Final: '0'\n\n        \"1100\":\n            Last two: \"00\" -> becomes '1'. Then string \"110\"\n            Then last two: \"10\" -> becomes '0'. Then string \"10\"\n            Then last two: \"10\" -> becomes '0'. Final: '0'\n\n        So all four reduce to '0'. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\n   Now, this matches the examples.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: the entire string must be reducible to the single character g (by repeatedly applying the operation until the string length is 1, and that one character must be g).\n\n   How do we count the number of strings of length (n+m) with n zeros and m ones that reduce to g?\n\n   Observation: The reduction process is deterministic (always take the last two) and the result depends on the entire string.\n\n   We can think of the reduction as a binary tree? But note: the operation is always on the last two, so the reduction is from right to left.\n\n   We can represent the reduction as a process that groups the string from right to left. Each operation takes the last two and replaces them by a new character. This is similar to a right-to-left evaluation of an expression.\n\n   Consider: \n        Operation: \n            \"00\" -> '1'\n            \"01\", \"10\" -> '0'\n            \"11\" -> '0'\n\n   We can define a function f(s) that returns the reduction of the entire string s (until length 1). But we want to count the number of strings of length (n+m) with n zeros and m ones that reduce to g.\n\n   We can also note: the reduction is independent of the order of operations because we are always taking the last two. So the reduction process is fixed.\n\n   However, we can also consider the reverse: starting from the goal (a string of length 1: either \"0\" or \"g\" must be the goal) and building the string backwards (using the reverse operation) to get to a string of length (n+m). The reverse operation is: \n        To get two characters, we can split a character into two characters (at the end) in two ways? Actually, the reverse operation is not uniquely defined. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming. But note: n, m up to 10^5, so the total length is up to 200000.\n\n   We need a combinatorial solution.\n\n   Let me denote:\n        Let T be the total length: L = n + m.\n\n   We are going to consider the reduction process as a sequence of operations. Each operation reduces the length by 1. Therefore, we need L-1 operations to reduce to a single character.\n\n   The reduction is deterministic, but the intermediate steps depend on the entire string.\n\n   We can model the reduction by breaking the string into parts. Notice that the reduction is from right to left, so the rightmost part is always processed first.\n\n   We can define the reduction value for a substring (from i to j) as a value (0 or 1). But we need to compute the reduction for the whole string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the idea of a stack and assign values to the entire string. \n\n   Let dp[i] be the reduction of the substring from 0 to i (if we process from left to right, but note our operation is from right to left). Actually, we process from right to left.\n\n   However, note that the operation is defined on the entire string from the last two. We can also consider the entire string as being built from rightmost segments.\n\n   Let me try to find a recurrence:\n\n        Let F(s) be the reduction of the string s.\n\n        Operation: \n            If s has length 1, then F(s)=s.\n            If s has length >=2, then F(s) = F( s[0:-2] + c ), where c is the reduction of the last two.\n\n        How to compute c from the last two?\n            Let x = last character, y = second last.\n            Then c = '1' if (x,y) == ('0','0')\n            Otherwise, c = '0'\n\n        Now, note that the entire string is built from zeros and ones, and we know the counts of zeros and ones.\n\n   Another idea: we can consider the reduction as a kind of balanced parentheses? Or use a state machine that tracks the current value and the effect on the count.\n\n   However, note the constraints: n, m up to 10^5.\n\n   We need to count the number of binary strings of length L (L=n+m) with exactly n zeros and m ones that reduce to g.\n\n   We can use generating functions or a recursive formula that breaks the string into parts.\n\n   Insight: the reduction process is similar to the following:\n\n        Consider that the entire string is broken into a sequence of operations. The result is determined by the parity of the entire string in a certain way? \n\n        Let me define a function that maps a string to its reduction. \n\n        We can also consider the reduction as a finite automaton that reads the string from right to left and updates a state (current value) and also keeps track of the effect on the counts (but we know the counts, so we cannot use that).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the idea of a bracket sequence and the fact that the reduction is associative? \n\n   But note: the operation is not associative. Example: \n        \"000\": \n            Option 1: take the last two: \"00\" -> '1', then we have \"0\" and then the string is \"01\" -> then reduce to '0'.\n            But wait, we are always taking the last two, so the reduction is deterministic and the entire string is reduced from right to left.\n\n        Steps for \"000\":\n            Start: \"000\"\n            Operation on last two: \"00\" -> '1', so we get \"01\"\n            Then operation on \"01\": becomes '0'\n\n        Steps for \"000\" in a different grouping (if we could choose arbitrarily) would be different, but we cannot because the operation is always on the last two.\n\n   So the reduction is fixed: we process from right to left.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let s be the string (from left to right). Then the reduction is done as:\n\n            Step 0: s_0, s_1, ..., s_{L-1}\n            Step 1: s_0, s_1, ..., s_{L-3}, f(s_{L-2}, s_{L-1])\n            Step 2: ... until one character.\n\n   We can write a recurrence for the entire string:\n\n        Let R(s) be the reduction of s.\n\n        Then R(s) = R(s[0:L-2] + str) where str is the reduction of s[L-2:L].\n\n        And the reduction of two characters (a,b) is:\n            if a=='0' and b=='0': then '1'\n            else: '0'\n\n   Now, note that the reduction of two characters can be seen as:\n\n        Let v = (a=='0') and (b=='0') ? 1 : 0\n\n        Then the two-character reduction is '1' if v==1, else '0'. \n\n   But wait, we can map the characters to bits: 0->0, 1->1. Then the reduction of two bits (a,b) is:\n\n        (a & b) ^ 1   ??? \n\n        Let me check:\n\n            a=0, b=0: 0&0=0, then 0^1=1 -> '1' -> correct.\n            a=0, b=1: 0&1=0 -> 0^1=1 -> but we want 0 -> incorrect.\n\n        Alternatively: \n            We want: \n                (0,0) -> 1\n                others -> 0\n\n        So: \n            (a==0 and b==0) -> 1\n            else 0\n\n        Which is: 1 - (a|b) [if we consider 0 and 1 as booleans?] but wait, if we use integers:\n\n            Let a_int = 0 for '0', 1 for '1'. Then we want:\n                if a_int==0 and b_int==0 -> then 1 (in integer form) but then we output '1'\n                else 0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define the operation in terms of the integers:\n\n            Let A = 0 for '0', 1 for '1'\n\n            Then the reduction of two characters (a,b) is: \n                if a+b == 0 (i.e., a=0 and b=0) then 1, else 0.\n\n        But note: the operation is defined by the rule: \n            \"00\" -> '1'\n            \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" -> '0'\n\n        In terms of integers (if we map '0' to 0, '1' to 1), then:\n\n            reduction(a,b) = 1 if a==0 and b==0 else 0.\n\n        But we can also express this as: (a & b) ^ (not (a|b))? Not necessary.\n\n   Now, we need to count the number of strings of length L (L = n+m) with exactly n zeros and m ones (so the string has n zeros and m ones) such that the reduction (as defined) is g.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming that goes from right to left (like the reduction process) and keep track of the current state (the current accumulated value and the counts). However, the state space is too big (counts up to 10^5, and the value is just 0 or 1, but we have to remember how many zeros and ones we have used so far).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use generating functions and the concept of a stack.\n\n   Observation: the reduction process is independent of the order of the first L-2 characters? \n\n   Another observation: the reduction is linear? \n\n   Let me try to find a pattern:\n\n        Let F(n, m, g) be the number of strings of n zeros and m ones that reduce to g.\n\n        Base: if n+m==1, then the string is either \"0\" or \"1\". Then the reduction is the string itself. So:\n            if g is the character, then F(n, m, g) = 1 if the string is g, else 0.\n\n        But note: the entire string must have exactly n zeros and m ones. So if n+m==1, then if n=1 and m=0 and g='0', then F(1,0,0)=1, etc.\n\n        For longer strings, we break the string into two parts: the last two characters and the rest.\n\n        The last two characters determine the next character (which is the reduction of the last two) and then the rest of the string (without the last two) is reduced recursively.\n\n        However, we are given the entire string and the counts. We need to count the number of strings.\n\n        Let the entire string s of length L = n+m.\n\n        The reduction of s is determined by the reduction of the substring s[0:L-2] (which must have a certain number of zeros and ones) and the last two characters.\n\n        But note: the reduction of the entire string is the reduction of the substring s[0:L-2] concatenated with the reduction of the last two.\n\n        However, the reduction of the entire string is the reduction of the reduction of the substring s[0:L-2] and the reduction of the last two? \n\n        Actually, the reduction is:\n\n            Let t = reduction(s[L-2:L])\n            Then the entire string is reduced by: reduction(s[0:L-2] + t)\n\n        But note: the entire string is processed from right to left, so the substring s[0:L-2] is reduced first (if we consider the entire string, the last two are taken first, then the next two from the right of the remaining string).\n\n        However, we can break the string arbitrarily? \n\n        Let me denote by R(s) the reduction of s.\n\n        Then R(s) = R( s[0:L-2] + str ) where str = reduction(s[L-2:L])\n\n        But note: the entire string is fixed. The counts of zeros and ones in the entire string are fixed.\n\n        The last two characters are two characters (say a and b). They contribute 2 characters. The rest of the string (length L-2) has n - (number of zeros in the last two) and m - (number of ones in the last two).\n\n        The reduction of the entire string is then the reduction of the string formed by the rest (L-2 characters) and the new character str.\n\n        Now, the rest (L-2 characters) must have exactly (n - zeros_in_last_two) zeros and (m - ones_in_last_two) ones.\n\n        Then we can write:\n\n            F(n, m, g) = \n                Sum over all possibilities for the last two characters (which are two characters, so 4 possibilities) of:\n                    Let a, b be the last two (in order from left to right, but note the string is stored as s[0..L-1], so the last two are s[L-2] and s[L-1]).\n                    Then the last two characters have:\n                         zeros_in_last_two = (1 if a=='0' else 0) + (1 if b=='0' else 0)\n                         ones_in_last_two = 2 - zeros_in_last_two\n\n                    Then the rest of the string must have n - zeros_in_last_two zeros and m - ones_in_last_two = m - (2 - zeros_in_last_two) ones.\n\n                    Then the reduction of the entire string is the reduction of the rest (which is a string of length L-2) concatenated with the reduction of the last two.\n\n                    But wait, the reduction is not linear: the entire string is reduced from right to left, so the rest is not simply the reduction of the rest (which is a string of length L-2) and then the reduction of the last two. \n\n        Actually, the reduction process:\n\n            Step1: reduce the last two to get a new character t.\n            Then the entire string becomes the rest (L-2 characters) with t appended at the end (but note: the rest is the first L-2 characters, and we appended t at the end, so the string is now: [first L-2] + [t]. Then we continue reducing from the right.\n\n            The reduction of the entire string is the same as the reduction of the string (first L-2) + t, but now the reduction is done from the right, so the last character is t. \n\n            However, the reduction of the rest (first L-2) is a string of length L-2, and then we append t. Then we reduce the entire string (which is now of length L-1) from the last two (which are the last two of the rest and then t? No: the rest is the first L-2, and then t is appended. So the entire string is: [first L-2] + [t]. The reduction then will take the last two of this string: which are the last character of the rest (which is the (L-3)th character) and t.\n\n        This seems complicated.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n\n        We note that the reduction process is equivalent to a binary tree (right-to-left) and the result is the value of the root.\n\n        We can consider the entire string as a sequence of leaves (the original characters) and the reduction operations as internal nodes.\n\n        Each internal node has two children (the two characters it replaces) and a value computed by the rule.\n\n        Then the entire reduction is the root.\n\n        Now, we want to count the number of full binary trees with L leaves (each leaf is either '0' or '1') and the counts of zeros and ones in the leaves are n and m, such that the root is g.\n\n        But note: the structure of the tree is fixed: we always combine the last two. This is a specific type of tree: a right-leaning comb? \n\n        Actually, the reduction process (always taking the last two) produces a tree that is a left-child/right-sibling? Or right-child/left-sibling? \n\n        Example: \"000\" (three zeros) -> \n            Operation1: combine the last two zeros: so the tree has two leaves for the last two, and then the first zero is the left child, and the two zeros are the right child (which is a node with two leaves). \n\n        The tree:\n\n            Root\n            /   \\\n           First  Node\n                  / \\\n                 0  0\n\n        Then the root's value is computed by (First, Node_value). And Node_value is computed by (0,0) -> 1.\n\n        Then the root's value is (0,1): according to the rule, (0,1) -> 0.\n\n        Now, we can define the value of an internal node by:\n\n            If the node is built from two children (left and right) with values a and b, then the node's value is:\n                if a==0 and b==0: 1\n                else: 0\n\n        And the leaves are 0 or 1.\n\n        The entire tree has L leaves (the original characters) and L-1 internal nodes.\n\n        The root is g.\n\n        Now, the problem becomes: count the number of full binary trees with L leaves (each leaf labeled 0 or 1) with exactly n zeros and m ones (in the leaves) and the root is g.\n\n        But note: the structure of the tree is fixed (the reduction process always takes the last two, so the tree is fixed: it is a right-comb?).\n\n        However, wait: the reduction process always takes the last two, so the tree is built by:\n\n            The rightmost two leaves become the children of the first internal node (at the top level). Then the remaining leaves are the left branch, and the first internal node is the right branch of the root.\n\n            Then the root's left child is the entire string without the last two, and the root's right child is the first internal node (which was built from the last two).\n\n        Then the entire tree is fixed in structure: it is a right-comb. \n\n        Actually, the reduction process (always from the right) produces a tree that is a left-child/right-sibling representation? \n\n        Let me draw:\n\n            String: [A0, A1, A2, ..., A_{L-1}]\n\n            Step1: combine A_{L-2} and A_{L-1} -> node N1 = (A_{L-2}, A_{L-1})\n            Step2: then the string becomes [A0, A1, ..., A_{L-3}, N1]\n\n            Then Step2: combine A_{L-3} and N1 -> node N2 = (A_{L-3}, N1)\n            Step3: then the string becomes [A0, A1, ..., A_{L-4}, N2]\n\n            ... until we have a single node.\n\n        So the tree is built from the right, and the left part (the original left part) becomes the left subtree of the root, and the right part is built by combining the rightmost two.\n\n        But note: the tree has a fixed structure: it is a left-heavy comb? Actually, the root has a left subtree that is the entire string without the last two, and a right subtree that is the reduction of the last two. Then the root's value is computed from (left_subtree_reduction, right_subtree_reduction).\n\n        However, wait: the reduction is defined on the entire string, and the rule for the root is:\n\n            root_value = reduction(left_part + right_node) \n\n        But note: the reduction of the entire string is the same as the reduction of the left_part (which is a string of length L-2) concatenated with the reduction of the last two (which is a character). Then we apply the reduction again: take the last two of (left_part + [reduction_of_last_two]).\n\n        But the left_part is itself built from the same reduction process.\n\n        Therefore, we can define:\n\n            Let F(L, n, m, g) be the number of strings of length L (with n zeros and m ones) that reduce to g.\n\n            Then, if L==1:\n                if g is the character (either '0' or '1') then return 1 if the string (which has either 0 or 1) matches, but note: n and m must be consistent: if L==1, then either (n=1, m=0) or (n=0, m=1). \n\n            For L>=2:\n\n                We break the string into two parts: the last two characters and the first L-2.\n\n                The last two characters can be:\n\n                    Case 1: \"00\": \n                        Then the reduction of the last two is '1'. \n                        The first L-2 part must have n-2 zeros and m ones (because we used two zeros).\n                        Then the entire string reduces to the reduction of the first L-2 part concatenated with '1'. \n\n                        But note: the reduction of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be formed by combining exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that when the string is reduced through a series of operations (always replacing the last two characters with one according to specific rules), the final result is the character `g`. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the count modulo 1000000007.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the reduction process is deterministic and depends on the entire string's structure. The operation replaces the last two characters with a new character (1 if both were zeros, otherwise 0). The challenge is to count all possible strings of length `n + m` with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones that reduce to `g`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j][k]` where:\n   - `i` is the total length of the string.\n   - `j` is the number of zeros.\n   - `k` is the resulting character (0 or 1).\n   The value `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of strings of length `i` with `j` zeros that reduce to `k`.\n\n3. **Base Case**: For strings of length 1, the result is simply the character itself if it matches `g`, considering the counts of zeros and ones.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For longer strings, we consider the last two characters and how they contribute to the result. Depending on whether the last two characters are \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", or \"11\", the reduction step either produces a '1' or a '0'. We then adjust the counts of zeros and ones accordingly and recursively compute the number of valid strings for the remaining part.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 1000000007.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    g = int(data[2])\n    \n    if n + m == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total_length = n + m\n    \n    dp = [[[0]*2 for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(total_length+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_length+1):\n        if i == 1:\n            if n == 1 and m == 0:\n                if g == 0:\n                    dp[i][n][g] = 1\n                else:\n                    dp[i][n][g] = 0\n            elif n == 0 and m == 1:\n                if g == 1:\n                    dp[i][n][g] = 1\n                else:\n                    dp[i][n][g] = 0\n            else:\n                dp[i][n][g] = 0\n        else:\n            for j in range(n+1):\n                if j < 0 or j > n:\n                    continue\n                    \n                ways = 0\n                if n - j >= 2:\n                    ways = (ways + dp[i-1][j-2][1]) % MOD\n                if j >= 1 and n - j >= 1:\n                    ways = (ways + dp[i-1][j-1][0]) % MOD\n                if j >= 1 and n - j >= 1:\n                    ways = (ways + dp[i-1][j-1][0]) % MOD\n                if j >= 2:\n                    ways = (ways + dp[i-1][j-1][0]) % MOD\n                    \n                dp[i][j][0] = ways\n                \n                if n - j == 2:\n                    ways_g1 = dp[i-1][j][0]\n                    ways_g0 = dp[i-1][j][1]\n                    if g == 0:\n                        dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + ways_g0) % MOD\n                    else:\n                        dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i][j][0] + ways_g1) % MOD\n                else:\n                    if g == 0:\n                        dp[i][j][0] = ways\n                    else:\n                        dp[i][j][1] = ways\n                        \n    if n + m == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        ans = dp[total_length][n][g % 2] if g % 2 == 0 else dp[total_length][n][1]\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values `n`, `m`, and `g` which represent the number of zeros, ones, and the desired result of the reduction process, respectively.\n2. **Base Handling**: If the total length of the string (`n + m`) is zero, it immediately returns 0 since no string can be formed.\n3. **DP Table Setup**: A 3D list `dp` is initialized to store intermediate results. The dimensions are `[total_length+1][n+1][2]`, representing strings of varying lengths, counts of zeros, and possible results (0 or 1).\n4. **Base Case Filling**: For strings of length 1, the result is set based on whether the single character matches `g`.\n5. **DP Table Population**: For each possible string length and count of zeros, the code calculates the number of valid strings by considering different combinations of the last two characters and their impact on the result.\n6. **Result Extraction**: The final answer is derived from the DP table by checking the count of strings of length `n + m` with `n` zeros that reduce to `g`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using dynamic programming, leveraging the deterministic nature of the reduction process to break down the problem into manageable subproblems.",
