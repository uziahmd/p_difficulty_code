He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n, then 2*n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of 2n-2 strings must be assigned.\n\n But note: the problem says that the set of prefixes and suffixes of the unknown string s (of length n) is given. And it is guaranteed that these strings are indeed prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the problem guarantees that the given set is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n, we can try to use the following idea:\n\n 1. For each length L (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings. One of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n 2. However, we cannot independently decide because the entire string s must be consistent. But note: the problem says we can output any assignment that leads to at least one string s.\n\n 3. How can we relate the prefixes and suffixes? Consider: the string s has length n. Then:\n    - The first character of s must be the first character of at least one prefix (which is the string of length 1) and similarly the last character must be the first character of at least one suffix (but wait, actually the last character is the last character of the suffix of length 1).\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string s is determined by its prefixes and suffixes. In particular, if we have two strings of the same length, they are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one prefix and one suffix. But the problem states that for each length there are two: one prefix and one suffix.\n\n 5. However, note: the problem does not require us to reconstruct the string, only to assign labels 'P' and 'S' to each input string such that:\n    - For each length L (from 1 to n-1), there is exactly one string of length L labeled 'P' and one labeled 'S'.\n\n 6. But wait, what if two strings of the same length are provided? Then we must assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. However, the problem says \"exactly two strings of each length\", so we know that for each length L, we have two strings. Therefore, we can group the strings by their lengths.\n\n 7. However, the catch is that the entire set must be consistent with a string s of length n. But note: the problem says that there is at least one string s consistent. So we don't need to find s, only to assign the labels.\n\n 8. But is the assignment independent per length? Not necessarily. Consider: the string s is fixed. Then the prefix of length 1 is the first character, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character. Now, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character. Similarly, the prefix of length 3 must start with the first three characters, etc.\n\n 9. However, the problem says we can output any assignment that is consistent. So we can try to use the following:\n\n    - We know that the entire string s must be such that for each length L, the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n    - How can we check consistency? We can try to reconstruct the string from the prefixes and suffixes. But note: we don't know which is which.\n\n 10. Alternate approach:\n\n    Let's consider the following: the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with a single string s of length n.\n\n    We can try to determine the first character and the last character. The first character is the first character of the prefix of length 1, and the last character is the first character of the suffix of length 1? Actually, no: the suffix of length 1 is the last character.\n\n    However, we don't know which of the two strings of length 1 is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n    Idea: \n        - We have two strings of length 1: let them be a and b.\n        - Then the string s must start with either a or b, and end with the other.\n\n    Then, for the next length (length 2), we have two strings: say x and y.\n        - The prefix of length 2 must start with the first character (which we have decided) and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character (which we have decided).\n\n    But note: we don't know the entire string, but we can use the following:\n\n        Let the two strings of length 1 be a and b. Then the string s must have first character = a[0] (if we assume the prefix is a) or b[0] (if the prefix is b). Similarly, the last character must be the other one.\n\n    Then, for the prefix of length 2: \n        If we have chosen the first character as a[0], then the prefix of length 2 must start with a[0]. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character (which is b[0]).\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Group the input strings by their lengths.\n\n        Step 2: For length 1, we have two strings: let them be str1 and str2 (each of length 1). Then, we have two possibilities:\n            Possibility 1: \n                prefix1 = str1, suffix1 = str2 -> then the string s starts with str1 and ends with str2.\n            Possibility 2:\n                prefix1 = str2, suffix1 = str1 -> then the string s starts with str2 and ends with str1.\n\n        Step 3: Then, for each length L from 2 to n-1, we have two strings. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix. The condition is that the prefix of length L must start with the chosen first L-1 characters? Actually, no: we don't have the entire prefix of length L from the previous steps. But note: we are not required to reconstruct the entire string, only to assign the labels.\n\n        However, the problem says: if there are several answers, output any. So we don't have to check consistency for all L? \n\n        But wait: the problem says that the given set is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of some string. So we can assign arbitrarily as long as for each L we assign one as P and one as S. However, is that sufficient? \n\n        Example: n=2: two strings of length 1. Then we must assign one as P and one as S. And that is the entire input. So we can output either \"PS\" or \"SP\".\n\n        Example: n=3: \n            Input: \n                3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n\n            Actually, wait: the example input was given as:\n                3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n\n            But note: the problem states that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1 (which is 1 and 2). So for length 1: two strings: ['a','a']? Actually, the example input has two 'a's and two 'aa's? \n\n            Correction: the example input in the problem was:\n                3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n\n            But wait, the example output is \"PPSS\". \n\n            However, the input has two strings of length 1: both \"a\", and two strings of length 2: both \"aa\". \n\n            This means that the two strings of the same length might be identical.\n\n            In this case, how do we assign? \n\n            Conditions: \n                The string s of length 3 must have:\n                    - A prefix of length 1: which is the first character.\n                    - A prefix of length 2: the first two characters.\n                    - A suffix of length 1: the last character.\n                    - A suffix of length 2: the last two characters.\n\n            And the set is { \"a\", \"aa\" } for both prefix and suffix? \n\n            Then the string s must be such that:\n                prefix1 = \"a\", prefix2 = \"aa\", suffix1 = \"a\", suffix2 = \"aa\"\n\n            Then s must be \"aaa\". \n\n            How do we assign the two \"a\"s and the two \"aa\"s?\n\n            We have two strings of length 1: both \"a\". We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix. Similarly, two strings of length 2: both \"aa\".\n\n            But note: the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of \"aaa\" are:\n                prefixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n                suffixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n\n            So the input set is exactly these.\n\n            Now, the assignment: \n                We have two \"a\": one must be prefix and one must be suffix. Similarly for \"aa\".\n\n            But wait: the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", and the suffix of length 2 is \"aa\". That is acceptable.\n\n            However, the example output is \"PPSS\". So the first two strings (which are the two \"a\"s) are assigned as 'P' and 'S', and the next two (the two \"aa\"s) are assigned as 'P' and 'S'.\n\n            But note: the input order is arbitrary. The example input is:\n\n                3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n\n            So the two \"a\"s are the first and the last, and the two \"aa\"s are the second and third.\n\n            Then the output should be: for the first string (a): 'P' or 'S'? \n\n            The example output is \"PPSS\". \n\n            How did they decide? \n\n            The problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n            But note: the assignment must be such that the set of prefixes is exactly the set of the strings we mark as 'P' and the set of suffixes as the set of strings we mark as 'S'. \n\n            In this case, the set of prefixes must be {\"a\", \"aa\"} and the set of suffixes must be {\"a\",\"aa\"}. \n\n            However, the two \"a\"s are identical. So if we assign one \"a\" as 'P' and the other as 'S', then the set of prefixes would contain \"a\" (from the one marked 'P') and the set of suffixes would contain \"a\" (from the one marked 'S'). Similarly, the two \"aa\"s: one marked 'P' and one marked 'S'.\n\n            But note: the example output is \"PPSS\". \n\n            What if we assign the first \"a\" as 'P', the second \"a\" as 'S', the first \"aa\" as 'P', and the second \"aa\" as 'S'? Then the set of prefixes is { \"a\", \"aa\" } and suffixes is { \"a\", \"aa\" }, which is correct.\n\n            Alternatively, we could assign the first \"a\" as 'S', the second \"a\" as 'P', the first \"aa\" as 'S', and the second \"aa\" as 'P'. Then the set of prefixes is { \"a\", \"aa\" } and suffixes is { \"a\", \"aa\" }.\n\n            But note: the problem does not specify which one is which. However, we must output a string of length 2n-2 (which is 4 in this case) of 'P' and 'S' with two 'P' and two 'S'.\n\n            The example output is \"PPSS\", meaning the first two are 'P' and the last two are 'S'. \n\n            Why did they choose that order? \n\n            The input order is:\n                line1: \"a\"\n                line2: \"aa\"\n                line3: \"aa\"\n                line4: \"a\"\n\n            And the output is for each of these lines: \n                line1: 'P'\n                line2: 'P'\n                line3: 'S'\n                line4: 'S'\n\n            So they assigned the two \"a\"s (at the beginning and the end) as the two prefixes? Actually, wait: there are two prefixes: one of length1 and one of length2. The two prefixes are \"a\" and \"aa\". \n\n            But note: the two \"a\"s are the same. So we can assign either one as the prefix of length1 and the other as the suffix of length1, and similarly for the two \"aa\"s.\n\n            How to resolve without knowing the entire string?\n\n            Observation: \n                The problem does not require the reconstruction of the entire string. It only requires to assign labels.\n\n            Since the assignment must satisfy that for each length L there is exactly one prefix and one suffix, we can do:\n\n                For each length L (from 1 to n-1):\n                    Let the two strings of length L be A and B.\n                    We will assign one of them as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n            But note: the two strings of the same length might be equal (like in the example). Then we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n            However, there is a catch: the entire set of prefixes must form a chain: the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1. Similarly, the suffixes must form a chain: the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n\n            But wait, we don't know which is which. However, the problem says there is at least one string s. So we can use the following:\n\n                We know the entire set of prefixes must be such that if we take the longest prefix, then the next shorter ones must be prefixes of that. Similarly for suffixes.\n\n            However, the problem does not require to check for consistency. It just says \"any\" assignment that works.\n\n            How about: \n\n                Step 1: Group the input strings by length.\n\n                Step 2: For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings. We can assign one arbitrarily as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            But wait: what if the two strings are different? Then we have to assign correctly based on the fact that the entire string s must be consistent. However, the problem says that the set is the set of prefixes and suffixes of some string. \n\n            Actually, we don't need to worry about consistency because the problem says that the given set is from a valid string. But we are free to assign arbitrarily as long as for each length we assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'. \n\n            However, is that always sufficient? \n\n            Example: n=4, and the set of prefixes and suffixes are:\n\n                length1: \"a\", \"b\"\n                length2: \"ab\", \"ba\"\n                length3: \"aba\", \"bab\"\n\n            Now, if we assign:\n                length1: \"a\" as 'P', \"b\" as 'S'\n                length2: \"ab\" as 'P', \"ba\" as 'S'\n                length3: \"aba\" as 'P', \"bab\" as 'S'\n\n            Then the set of prefixes is {\"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\"} and the set of suffixes is {\"b\", \"ba\", \"bab\"}.\n\n            Is there a string s of length 4 that has these as its proper prefixes and suffixes?\n\n            The string s must be such that:\n                prefix1 = \"a\", prefix2 = \"ab\", prefix3 = \"aba\", so the entire string must start with \"aba\", so the fourth character is arbitrary? But also the suffixes must end with \"bab\": so the last three letters must be \"bab\". \n\n            Then the entire string is \"abab\", because:\n                prefix1: \"a\"\n                prefix2: \"ab\"\n                prefix3: \"aba\"\n                suffix1: last char of \"abab\" is 'b'\n                suffix2: last two chars of \"abab\" are \"ab\" -> but we assigned the suffix2 as \"ba\" (from the input) and we have \"ab\", which is not \"ba\". \n\n            So this assignment is invalid.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot assign arbitrarily.\n\n            We must ensure that the assignment is consistent with the entire string.\n\n            How to do that?\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Let the two strings of length L be A and B. We have two choices for each L.\n\n            But note: the entire string s must be the same for all L. \n\n            We can try to fix the first character and the last character (from the length1 group) and then for each L, check which of the two strings of length L can be the prefix and which can be the suffix.\n\n            However, the problem says that the set is from a valid string, so there is at least one way.\n\n            Another idea: \n\n            We know that the string s must have:\n\n                s[0:k] = prefix_k   for each k from 1 to n-1 (if we mark a string of length k as prefix)\n                s[n-k:n] = suffix_k   for each k from 1 to n-1 (if we mark a string of length k as suffix)\n\n            But note: the two strings of the same length are either the prefix and the suffix (or two of the same type? no, one is prefix and one is suffix).\n\n            Actually, the problem states: \"exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1\", and they are the prefixes and suffixes.\n\n            So the set of prefixes is exactly the set of strings marked as 'P', and the set of suffixes is the set of strings marked as 'S'. \n\n            Now, consider: the entire string s must be built from the prefixes. Specifically, the prefix of length n-1 must be s[0:n-1]. Then the last character of s is the one not in the prefix of length n-1 (and must be the suffix of length 1). \n\n            Alternatively, we can try to build the string from the given set. But note: the set contains the proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\n            However, the problem size is small: n from 2 to 100, but the total strings is 2n-2, so up to 198. But the length of each string is at most n-1 (so up to 99). \n\n            We cannot iterate over all assignments (there are 2^(2n-2) possibilities) because 2n-2 can be up to 198, which is too many.\n\n            We need a smarter way.\n\n            Insight:\n\n            The entire string s must be such that the prefix of length k (if we know it) and the suffix of length k (if we know it) must satisfy:\n\n                The prefix of length k must be the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters of s.\n\n            Moreover, the two strings of length k must be the two candidates: one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n            Now, consider the relation between the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k:\n\n                The prefix of length k must be compatible with the prefix of length k-1 (if we have one) and the suffix of length k must be compatible with the suffix of length k-1.\n\n            But note: we don't know the entire assignment.\n\n            However, we can use the following:\n\n                Let F(k) be the prefix of length k (if we assign the first candidate of length k as prefix) and G(k) the suffix of length k (the second candidate). But wait, we don't know which one is which.\n\n            Alternatively, consider the following: \n\n                The entire string s must be the same regardless of the labeling. \n\n                In particular, consider the two strings of length 1: they must be the first character and the last character.\n\n                Then, the two strings of length 2: they must be the first two characters and the last two characters.\n\n                The first two characters must start with the first character (from length1 prefix) and the last two characters must end with the last character (from length1 suffix).\n\n            So we can:\n\n                Step 1: Identify the two strings of length 1: let them be c1 and c2.\n\n                Step 2: Then, the two strings of length 2 must be:\n                    The prefix of length2: it must start with c1 (if we assume c1 is the prefix of length1) OR if c1 is the suffix of length1, then the prefix of length1 is c2, so the prefix of length2 must start with c2.\n\n                But wait, we don't know which is the prefix and which is the suffix of length1.\n\n                Step 3: We have two possibilities for length1. Then, for length2, we have two strings. We must choose one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n                Condition for the prefix of length2: it must start with the chosen prefix of length1.\n\n                Condition for the suffix of length2: it must end with the chosen suffix of length1.\n\n            Then, for the two strings of length2, one must start with the prefix of length1 and the other must end with the suffix of length1.\n\n            But note: the two strings of length2 are distinct? Not necessarily. The problem doesn't say they are distinct. \n\n            However, the guarantee is that the set is the set of prefixes and suffixes of some string. \n\n            So, if we fix the assignment for length1, then for length2 we must assign the two strings such that one matches the condition for prefix (starts with the prefix1) and the other matches the condition for suffix (ends with the suffix1).\n\n            Then, we can extend this to longer lengths.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n            Let the input be stored in a list `arr` of 2n-2 strings.\n\n            Step 1: Group the strings by their length. We'll have a dictionary: `groups` where key is length, value is list of two strings.\n\n            Step 2: Consider the two possibilities for length1.\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                Let the two strings of length1 be a and b.\n                Assume:\n                    prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b.\n\n            Then, for each length L from 2 to n-1:\n                We have two strings: let them be x and y.\n                One of them must be the prefix (so it must start with the prefix of length L-1? Actually, no: we don't have the entire prefix of length L-1 from the previous step, but we know the entire prefix of length L-1 must be the prefix we have for length L-1. However, we are building the entire string from the prefixes.\n\n                But note: we are not building the entire string, we are just assigning the labels.\n\n                However, the condition for the prefix of length L is that it must be a string that, if we were to use it, the prefix of length L-1 must be its prefix. Similarly, the suffix of length L must have the suffix of length L-1 as its suffix.\n\n                But wait, we don't have the entire set of prefixes and suffixes built. However, we can check for the two strings of length L:\n\n                Condition for a string x of length L to be a prefix: \n                    Let the prefix of length L-1 be known (from our assignment for length L-1). Then x must start with that prefix of length L-1.\n\n                Similarly, for a string x to be a suffix, it must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n            But note: we are trying one possibility for length1, and then for each length we have two choices. However, we don't know the assignment for the other lengths until we check.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Let's define:\n                    Let `prefix_chain` be a list for the prefix of each length (from 1 to n-1) and `suffix_chain` for the suffix.\n\n                We start with two possibilities for length1.\n\n                Then, for length2, we have two strings. We must choose one as prefix and one as suffix. The condition for the prefix candidate is that it must start with the chosen prefix1. The condition for the suffix candidate is that it must end with the chosen suffix1.\n\n                Then, for length3, the two strings must be checked against the last two characters of the prefix of length2 (for the prefix candidate) and the first two characters of the suffix of length2 (for the suffix candidate)? \n\n                Actually, the prefix of length3 must be the entire prefix of length2 plus one more character. But we don't have the entire prefix of length2, we have the string of length2. Similarly, the suffix of length3 must be the entire suffix of length2 plus one more character at the beginning? Actually, no: the suffix of length3 is the last three characters, so it must end with the suffix of length2.\n\n                More precisely:\n\n                For a string x to be the prefix of length L, it must be the case that if we take the prefix of length L-1 (which we have already chosen) and append a character, then we get x. But wait, we don't know the entire string. \n\n                Actually, the problem does not require us to know the entire string, only to assign the labels.\n\n                But we can use the following: \n\n                    We know the entire set of prefixes must be consistent. In particular, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 extended by one character.\n\n                However, we don't have the entire set of prefixes, we have two candidates for each length. \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following simpler idea:\n\n                Since the set of prefixes and suffixes is given, and the entire string s is of length n, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n\n                Then, the condition for the two strings of length L is:\n\n                    The prefix of length L must be the first L characters of s, and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n                Moreover, the entire string s must be the same for all L.\n\n            But note: the set of prefixes and suffixes is fixed. So the entire string s is uniquely determined by the set of prefixes (or suffixes) if we know the ordering. \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent\".\n\n            We are allowed to output any assignment.\n\n            Here is a greedy method:\n\n                Step 1: Group by length.\n\n                Step 2: For length1, we have two strings. We try both possibilities (if we have time, but n is at most 100, but the total length is 2n-2, which is 198, and n is at most 100, but we cannot try both possibilities for every length because the length goes up to 100 and the branching factor is 2 per length, so 2^(n-1) which is 2^99, too many).\n\n            We must find a better way.\n\n            Insight from the problem statement: the set of given strings is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n.\n\n            Then, we can reconstruct the entire string s by:\n\n                Let s = [unknown]\n\n                We know the set of prefixes and suffixes. Then, the entire string s must be such that:\n\n                    The prefix of length 1 is the first character, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character.\n\n                    Then, the prefix of length 2 must be the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 must be the last two characters.\n\n                But note: the prefix of length 2 must be consistent with the prefix of length 1: i.e., the prefix of length2 must start with the prefix of length1.\n\n                Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with the suffix of length1.\n\n                Also, the entire string must be of length n.\n\n            However, we are not required to output s, only to assign labels.\n\n            Another observation:\n\n                The set of prefixes must be a set of strings that are increasing in length and the shorter one is a prefix of the longer one.\n\n                Similarly, the set of suffixes must be a set of strings that are increasing in length and the shorter one is a suffix of the longer one.\n\n            But note: the two strings of the same length are one prefix and one suffix, so we cannot compare them by inclusion.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                For each length L, we have two strings. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n                The condition for a string to be a prefix of length L is that it must be the continuation of the prefix of length L-1 (i.e., the prefix of length L-1 is its prefix). Similarly, the condition for a string to be a suffix of length L is that it must contain the suffix of length L-1 as its suffix.\n\n            Then, we can:\n\n                Step 1: Group by length.\n\n                Step 2: Start with length1. We have two strings: a and b.\n\n                Possibility 1: \n                    Let prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b.\n\n                Then, for length2:\n                    We have two strings: x and y.\n                    Which one is the prefix? It must start with a. Which one is the suffix? It must end with b.\n\n                    But what if neither condition holds for one of them? Then this possibility is invalid.\n\n                    However, the problem guarantees that there is at least one string s. So if one possibility fails, we try the other.\n\n                Then, for length3:\n                    We have two strings: p and q.\n                    The prefix candidate must start with the chosen prefix2 (which is one of x or y) and also must be such that the prefix2 is its prefix (i.e., the first two characters of the prefix candidate must be the prefix2).\n\n                    Similarly, the suffix candidate must end with the chosen suffix2.\n\n                But wait, the prefix of length3 is s[0:3] = prefix2 + next_char. So the first two characters must be the prefix2, and the third character is arbitrary? However, we don't know the entire string. \n\n                Actually, the condition for the prefix of length3 is that it must be the prefix2 extended by one character. But we don't know the character. However, the set of prefixes must be exactly the given set, so the prefix of length3 must be one of the two strings of length3. \n\n                But note: the two strings of length3 are given. And one of them must be the prefix and the other the suffix. \n\n                The condition for the prefix candidate is: \n                    candidate_prefix3 must start with prefix2 (the string of length2) and also its length is 3.\n\n                Similarly, the suffix candidate must end with suffix2.\n\n                However, there's a catch: the entire string s must be consistent. For example, the last three characters (suffix3) must be the last two characters (suffix2) plus the last character (which is the last character of the entire string, which is the suffix1). But wait, the last character is suffix1 (which is b). \n\n                Actually, the suffix of length3 must be the last three characters, so it must be the suffix2 (last two) plus the last character (which is the same as the suffix1). So the suffix3 must be suffix2 + b? \n\n                But note: the suffix2 is of length2, and the last character is b, so the last three characters are (some two characters) + b, but the last two characters are the suffix2. The last two characters are the last two, so the entire suffix3 is the last three, which is the last two (suffix2) and the one before that. But we don't know the entire string.\n\n            After careful thought, here's a plan:\n\n                We'll try the two possibilities for length1.\n\n                For a given possibility (prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b):\n\n                    Let prefix_chain = [a]   # the chosen prefix for each length so far\n                    Let suffix_chain = [b]   # the chosen suffix for each length so far\n\n                    Then, for L from 2 to n-1:\n                        Let the two strings of length L be cand1 and cand2.\n\n                        We have two ways to assign: \n                            Option A: cand1 as prefix, cand2 as suffix.\n                            Option B: cand2 as prefix, cand1 as suffix.\n\n                        Check Option A:\n                            For cand1 to be the prefix of length L: \n                                The prefix of length L-1 is prefix_chain[L-2] (since L-1 is the previous length, and we have stored the prefix of length L-1). Then, cand1 must start with prefix_chain[L-2] and have length L.\n\n                            For cand2 to be the suffix of length L:\n                                The suffix of length L-1 is suffix_chain[L-2]. Then, cand2 must end with suffix_chain[L-2] and have length L.\n\n                        Similarly, Option B:\n                            cand2 must start with prefix_chain[L-2] and have length L.\n                            cand1 must end with suffix_chain[L-2] and have length L.\n\n                        But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n                        Actually, the prefix of length L must be the previous prefix (of length L-1) extended by one character. But the previous prefix is of length L-1, and the new prefix is of length L. So the first L-1 characters of the new prefix must be the previous prefix.\n\n                        Similarly, the suffix of length L must have the previous suffix (of length L-1) as its last L-1 characters.\n\n                        However, the two conditions are:\n\n                            For cand1 to be the prefix: cand1[0:L-1] == prefix_chain[L-2]\n                            For cand2 to be the suffix: cand2[L-(L-1):] == suffix_chain[L-2]   -> cand2[1:] == suffix_chain[L-2] if L-1 is the length of the previous suffix? \n\n                        Actually, the suffix_chain[L-2] is a string of length L-1. The suffix of length L must end with that string. So the last L-1 characters of cand2 must be suffix_chain[L-2].\n\n                        Example for L=2:\n                            cand1 is the prefix: it must start with prefix_chain[0] (which is a) and have length2 -> so cand1[0:1] == a.\n                            cand2 is the suffix: it must end with suffix_chain[0] (which is b) and have length2 -> so cand2[1:2] == b.\n\n                        But wait, the condition for the suffix of length2: the last two characters of the entire string are cand2. But we only know the last character is b. The condition for the suffix of length2 is that it must end with the suffix of length1 (which is b). So the last character is b, but the condition for the suffix of length2 is that the last two characters must be cand2. However, we don't know the entire string, but the condition is that cand2 must be a string of length2 that ends with b.\n\n                        This is necessary but is it sufficient? \n\n                        We also need to ensure that the entire string s is consistent. However, the problem guarantees that there is at least one string s, so if one option passes the condition for every L, then we can use that option.\n\n                Then, we record the assignment for each string.\n\n            Steps for a given possibility:\n\n                Let `assignment` be a dictionary: mapping string to either 'P' or 'S'\n\n                For L=1:\n                    assign a -> 'P', b -> 'S'\n\n                For L from 2 to n-1:\n                    Let cand1, cand2 = the two strings of length L.\n\n                    Try Option A: \n                        if cand1 starts with prefix_chain[L-2] and cand2 ends with suffix_chain[L-2]:\n                            then assign cand1 to 'P', cand2 to 'S'\n                            update prefix_chain.append(cand1)\n                            update suffix_chain.append(cand2)\n                            and break.\n\n                    Else, try Option B:\n                        if cand2 starts with prefix_chain[L-2] and cand1 ends with suffix_chain[L-2]:\n                            then assign cand2 to 'P', cand1 to 'S'\n                            update prefix_chain.append(cand2)\n                            update suffix_chain.append(cand1)\n                            and break.\n\n                    If neither works, then this possibility (starting with a and b) is invalid.\n\n                Then, if we successfully assigned all lengths, then we output the assignment for the original input order.\n\n            But note: the input order is arbitrary. We need to output a string of length 2n-2: the i-th character is 'P' if the i-th input string is 'P', else 'S'.\n\n            However, we grouped by length. We need to remember the original index.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store the assignment by the string itself. But note: the two strings of the same length might be identical, but the input order might be different.\n\n            Important: the problem does not say that the strings are distinct. But the example with identical strings: we must assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            But wait, if the two strings of length L are identical, then:\n\n                Option A: cand1 = cand2 = s (say). Then, we require:\n                    s starts with prefix_chain[L-2] and s ends with suffix_chain[L-2].\n\n                But note: the condition for the prefix is that the first L-1 characters of s must be prefix_chain[L-2]. But s has length L, so the first L-1 characters are s[0:L-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string in the input is a prefix or a suffix of a hidden string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the strings based on their lengths and ensuring that the assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) labels is consistent with the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, one will be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n2. **Handling Length 1 Strings**: The strings of length 1 are critical because they determine the first and last characters of the hidden string `s`. We consider both possible assignments (either the first string is a prefix and the second is a suffix, or vice versa).\n3. **Checking Consistency for Longer Strings**: For each subsequent length `L` (from 2 to `n-1`), we check which of the two strings can be a prefix and which can be a suffix. A string can be a prefix if it starts with the previously chosen prefix of length `L-1`. Similarly, a string can be a suffix if it ends with the previously chosen suffix of length `L-1`.\n4. **Output the Result**: Once a valid assignment is found for all lengths, we output a string of 'P's and 'S's corresponding to the original input order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        L = len(s)\n        if L < n:\n            if L not in groups:\n                groups[L] = []\n            groups[L].append(s)\n    \n    for L in range(1, n):\n        if L not in groups:\n            groups[L] = []\n        while len(groups[L]) < 2:\n            groups[L].append(\"\")\n    \n    ans = [''] * len(strings)\n    valid_found = False\n    \n    for idx, a in enumerate(groups[1]):\n        if a == \"\":\n            continue\n        b = groups[1][1 - idx]\n        prefix_chain = [a]\n        suffix_chain = [b]\n        assign_dict = {a: 'P', b: 'S'}\n        \n        flag = True\n        for L in range(2, n):\n            if L not in groups:\n                continue\n            cands = groups[L]\n            cand1 = cands[0]\n            cand2 = cands[1]\n            option1_ok = False\n            option1 = None\n            option2 = None\n            \n            if cand1.startswith(prefix_chain[-1]) and cand2.endswith(suffix_chain[-1]):\n                option1_ok = True\n                option1 = ('P', 'S')\n            else:\n                option1_ok = False\n                \n            if cand2.startswith(prefix_chain[-1]) and cand1.endswith(suffix_chain[-1]):\n                option2_ok = True\n                option2 = ('S', 'P')\n            else:\n                option2_ok = False\n                \n            if option1_ok:\n                assign_dict[cand1] = 'P'\n                assign_dict[cand2] = 'S'\n                prefix_chain.append(cand1)\n                suffix_chain.append(cand2)\n            elif option2_ok:\n                assign_dict[cand1] = 'S'\n                assign_dict[cand2] = 'P'\n                prefix_chain.append(cand2)\n                suffix_chain.append(cand1)\n            else:\n                flag = False\n                break\n                \n        if flag:\n            for i, s_str in enumerate(strings):\n                if s_str in assign_dict:\n                    ans[i] = assign_dict[s_str]\n            valid_found = True\n            break\n            \n    if not valid_found:\n        for a in groups[1]:\n            if a == \"\":\n                continue\n            b = groups[1][1 - groups[1].index(a)]\n            prefix_chain = [a]\n            suffix_chain = [b]\n            assign_dict = {a: 'P', b: 'S'}\n            flag = True\n            for L in range(2, n):\n                cands = groups[L]\n                cand1 = cands[0]\n                cand2 = cands[1]\n                option1_ok = cand1.startswith(prefix_chain[-1]) and cand2.endswith(suffix_chain[-1])\n                option2_ok = cand2.startswith(prefix_chain[-1]) and cand1.endswith(suffix_chain[-1])\n                \n                if option1_ok:\n                    assign_dict[cand1] = 'P'\n                    assign_dict[cand2] = 'S'\n                    prefix_chain.append(cand1)\n                    suffix_chain.append(cand2)\n                elif option2_ok:\n                    assign_dict[cand1] = 'S'\n                    assign_dict[cand2] = 'P'\n                    prefix_chain.append(cand2)\n                    suffix_chain.append(cand1)\n                else:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n                    \n            if flag:\n                for i, s_str in enumerate(strings):\n                    if s_str in assign_dict:\n                        ans[i] = assign_dict[s_str]\n                valid_found = True\n                break\n                \n    res_str = ''.join(ans)\n    print(res_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into individual strings. The first line specifies the length `n` of the hidden string `s`.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths. For each length from 1 to `n-1`, there should be exactly two strings.\n3. **Initial Assignment**: The strings of length 1 are processed first. We consider both possible assignments (one as prefix, the other as suffix).\n4. **Consistency Check**: For each subsequent length, we check if the strings can be assigned as prefixes or suffixes based on the previous assignments. A string is a valid prefix if it starts with the previous prefix, and a valid suffix if it ends with the previous suffix.\n5. **Result Construction**: Once valid assignments are found for all lengths, the result is constructed by marking each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on the assignments. The result is printed as a concatenated string of 'P's and 'S's.\n\nThis approach ensures that the hidden string `s` can be reconstructed from the assigned prefixes and suffixes, adhering to the problem constraints.",
