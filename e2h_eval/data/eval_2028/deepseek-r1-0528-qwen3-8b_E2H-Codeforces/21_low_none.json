The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one for the chests (a_i) and one for the keys (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, i.e., they must be of opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   - If a_i is even, then we need a key with odd integer.\n   - If a_i is odd, then we need a key with even integer.\n\n Therefore, we can split the chests into two groups:\n   Group1: even chests (a_i even)\n   Group2: odd chests (a_i odd)\n\n Similarly, we can split the keys into two groups:\n   Group1: even keys (b_j even)\n   Group2: odd keys (b_j odd)\n\n However, note the matching rule:\n   - Even chest requires odd key.\n   - Odd chest requires even key.\n\n So, the even chests can only be matched with odd keys, and the odd chests can only be matched with even keys.\n\n But note: we have two sets of keys: even and odd. Let's denote:\n   Let E_chest = count of even numbers in a_i\n   Let O_chest = count of odd numbers in a_i\n\n   Let E_key = count of even numbers in b_j\n   Let O_key = count of odd numbers in b_j\n\n Then, the maximum number of chests we can open is limited by:\n\n   For even chests: we can use at most min(E_chest, O_key) because each even chest requires an odd key.\n   For odd chests: we can use at most min(O_chest, E_key) because each odd chest requires an even key.\n\n However, wait: but note that the same key cannot be used twice. So the total matching is constrained by the available keys.\n\n But here's a catch: the two types of chests require two different key types. So we can consider:\n\n   We have two independent bipartite graphs: one between even chests and odd keys, and the other between odd chests and even keys.\n\n However, the entire set of keys is fixed. The odd keys can only be used for even chests, and even keys for odd chests.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the sum of the two independent matchings?\n\n   total = min(E_chest, O_key) + min(O_chest, E_key)\n\n Let's test with the first example:\n\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        E_chest = 3, O_chest = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        E_key = 3, O_key = 1\n\n   Then: \n        even chests (3) can use odd keys: min(3, 1) = 1\n        odd chests (2) can use even keys: min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 1 + 2 = 3 -> matches.\n\n   Second example:\n\n        Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_chest=5, O_chest=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd -> E_key=0, O_key=1\n\n        min(5,1) = 1 for even chests, min(0,0)=0 for odd chests -> total=1.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n        Chests: [10] -> even -> E_chest=1, O_chest=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_key=4, O_key=0\n\n        min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total=0.\n\n This approach seems to work.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to actually assign the keys arbitrarily? It just asks for the maximum number.\n\n But wait: what if we have more than one way to assign? Actually, the two conditions are independent because:\n   - The even chests require odd keys and odd keys can only be used for even chests (since if an odd key is used for an odd chest, it fails because (odd+odd) is even).\n   - Similarly, even keys can only be used for odd chests.\n\n Therefore, the two sets",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This means that even-numbered chests must be paired with odd-numbered keys, and odd-numbered chests must be paired with even-numbered keys. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests into two groups based on whether their numbers are even or odd. Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd groups.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Openings**: For even-numbered chests, the maximum number that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys (since each even chest requires an odd key). For odd-numbered chests, the maximum is the minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n3. **Sum the Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the maximum values calculated for even and odd chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (`even_chest`) and how many have odd numbers (`odd_chest`).\n3. **Categorizing Keys**: Similarly, the code counts the number of even and odd keys (`even_key` and `odd_key` respectively).\n4. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the smaller of `even_chest` and `odd_key`. The maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the smaller of `odd_chest` and `even_key`.\n5. **Output Result**: The sum of these two maximum values gives the answer, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity, O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys respectively.",
