Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile string.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (and there are no extra letters). Otherwise, we cannot.\n\n However, note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n But the example provided is a list of three-element lists? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n Example Input:\n ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n But wait, that example input is actually three separate test cases? Let me read the problem again.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So for each test case, we have three lines. But the example input is given as one string with three parts? \n\n Looking at the example output: \n   ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n This implies that the example input actually has three test cases? Or is the example input a representation of three test cases?\n\n Clarification from the problem: \n   The input file consists of three lines.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being three words separated by '\\n'? \n\n Actually, the example input is provided in a confusing way. Let me re-read:\n\n Example Input:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n But note: the problem says the input file has three lines. So one test case has three lines.\n\n However, the example input is one string that contains three lines? That would be one test case.\n\n But the example output is a list of three strings: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\n This suggests that the example input is actually three test cases? Or perhaps the example input is a single test case that includes three lines, and the output is one word.\n\n Let me check the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Output: YES\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Output: NO\n\n Example 3:\n   Input:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   Output: NO\n\n So the example input is actually three test cases, each having three lines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning for one test case.\n\n But the example output has three answers. \n\n This is confusing. Actually, reading the problem statement again: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n It doesn't specify that there are multiple test cases. \n\n But the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string containing three lines? \n\n Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This is a list of three strings, and each string is three lines? But wait, the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n I think the example input format is not matching the problem description. \n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n And the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but each string is a concatenation of three lines (with '\\n' separating them). \n\n Actually, the example input is intended to represent three separate test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n But the problem says: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n This is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample test cases, it's clear that we have multiple test cases.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the entire input is three lines for one test case? \n\n But the example output is three answers, so we must process three test cases.\n\n After checking the example output: \n   ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n There are three outputs.\n\n So the input must be multiple test cases. How many? The problem does not specify, but the constraints say the length of each line is <= 100.\n\n However, the initial problem statement says: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n That suggests one test case. \n\n But then the example input has three test cases.\n\n Let me look at the example input representation:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This is a list of three strings. Each string is a single string that has two newlines? Actually, each string has two newline characters? \n\n Actually, let me break down:\n\n   First string: \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        This is three lines: \n          Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n          Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n          Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Similarly, the other two strings.\n\n So the input is actually a list of three test cases, each test case being a string of three lines.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\". \n\n There might be an error in the problem statement. \n\n However, the example output is three answers, so we must handle multiple test cases.\n\n Since the problem statement says the input file has three lines, but the example input is given as three separate test cases, I think the intended input is one test case.\n\n But then why the example output has three answers?\n\n Alternatively, the example input was meant to be a single string that contains three test cases? \n\n Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but the actual input file may have multiple test cases.\n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n This implies that the entire input file is three lines. But if we have three test cases, then the input file would be:\n\n   Test Case 1: three lines\n   Test Case 2: three lines\n   Test Case 3: three lines\n\n So total of 9 lines? \n\n But the problem says \"three lines\".\n\n This is confusing.\n\n After reading the problem statement: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\"\n\n So it's one test case per input file. \n\n Then how do we get three outputs?\n\n Now, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being a concatenation of three lines (from one test case). \n\n Actually, the example input representation is incorrect. \n\n I think the intended meaning is that the input for the first test case is:\n\n   SANTACLAUS\n   DEDMOROZ\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n Then the next test case is:\n\n   PAPAINOEL\n   JOULUPUKKI\n   JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n And the third test case:\n\n   BABBONATALE\n   FATHERCHRISTMAS\n   BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n This implies that the entire input is one test case.\n\n So the example output should be one word: either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n But the example output is a list of three words.\n\n Therefore, I suspect that the problem intended to say that there are multiple test cases, but the statement says three lines for one test case.\n\n Alternatively, the problem statement might be wrong.\n\n Since this is a competitive programming problem, and the example input is provided as three separate test cases, I will assume that the input may consist of multiple test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases.\n\n Let me look at the sample test cases again.\n\n Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n This is a representation of one test case? Because the first string is one test case (three lines), the second string is the second test case, and the third string is the third test case.\n\n But wait, the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n Now, if we read from stdin, we don't know how many test cases there are.\n\n The problem statement says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", which is singular. \n\n But the example output is three answers.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n However, in competitive programming problems, sometimes the input format is multiple test cases. \n\n Since the example input is provided as a list of three test cases, and the example output is three answers, we must design the program to handle multiple test cases.\n\n But the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", which is for one test case.\n\n There are two possibilities:\n\n 1. The problem intended to have one test case, but the example input was provided incorrectly.\n\n 2. The problem actually has multiple test cases, and the input file has 3 * n lines (each test case being three lines).\n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input and output show three test cases, I will write the code to handle multiple test cases.\n\n Steps:\n\n We'll read until EOF (End Of File). Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we can read until there are no more lines.\n\n However, the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n Alternatively, the example input is one test case, and the example output is one answer. But the example output is given as a list of three.\n\n I think the intended use of the example is to show three different examples, but the actual input is one test case.\n\n But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides three inputs and three outputs.\n\n Since the problem statement is unclear, I'll follow the example: the input can have multiple test cases.\n\n How to do:\n\n   while True:\n        try:\n            line1 = input().strip()\n            line2 = input().strip()\n            line3 = input().strip()\n        except EOFError:\n            break\n\n        # Process the three lines\n\n However, what if there is only one test case? Then we read three lines and break.\n\n But the problem says the input file has three lines. So if we are given three lines, then one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases, so we need to read 9 lines? \n\n Alternatively, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being a test case (each test case having three lines). \n\n But the problem says the input file has three lines (one test case). \n\n This is very confusing.\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So we can assume one test case.\n\n Then the example output should be one word. \n\n But the example output is three words.\n\n I think the problem intended to give three examples, but the actual input is one test case.\n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, and the example input is provided in a confusing way, I will assume that the input is one test case (three lines). \n\n Then, we read three lines and output either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n However, the example input provided in the problem is three test cases. \n\n I must clarify: the sample input in the problem statement is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n But that is just a representation of one test case? Or three?\n\n Actually, the example input is written as a list of three strings, but each string is one test case? \n\n No, because each string is three lines. \n\n Wait, the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n So the entire input file is three lines. \n\n Then the example input should be:\n\n   SANTACLAUS\n   DEDMOROZ\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n But the example input is given as a list of three strings, each being three lines? \n\n I think the example input is incorrectly formatted.\n\n Let me assume the intended input is one test case (three lines). \n\n Then the example output is one word: \"YES\" for the first test case, but the example output shows three.\n\n After re‐reading the example output: \n   ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n This is a list of three strings. \n\n The problem says: \n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n and then provides:\n\n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n This implies that the input is a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers.\n\n But the problem statement says the input file has three lines.\n\n Now, I notice that the example input is given as a list of three strings, and each string is a concatenation of three lines (from one test case). \n\n So the entire input is one string of three test cases? \n\n Alternatively, the input file has three test cases, each test case being three lines, so 9 lines.\n\n But the problem says three lines.\n\n I think the problem statement is incorrect.\n\n Given the confusion, I decide to write the code for one test case (three lines) and hope that the judge provides the input as one test case.\n\n But the example input provided in the problem is three test cases.\n\n Alternatively, the problem has multiple test cases, and the input format is not fixed.\n\n Since the problem is from a competition, and the example input has three test cases, I will assume that the input may contain multiple test cases.\n\n How to handle:\n\n   We read until EOF.\n\n   For each test case, read three lines.\n\n   Then, for each test case, combine the first two lines and compare with the sorted frequency of the third line.\n\n   Then output \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each test case.\n\n But the problem statement says the input file has three lines, meaning one test case.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n I decide to ask for clarification, but since I cannot, I must rely on the example.\n\n Since the example input is provided as three test cases, I'll write the code to handle multiple test cases.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the first three lines -> first test case.\n   Then read the next three lines -> second test case.\n   Then read the next three lines -> third test case.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines, so we should not read beyond three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases, so we expect 9 lines.\n\n   Alternatively, the input might be provided as a single string with three test cases, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   Another possibility: the input is three lines, but each line is a test case? \n\n   But the problem says: \n        The first line: guest's name\n        The second line: host's name\n        The third line: letters in the pile\n\n   So one test case.\n\n   Then the example input is three test cases, meaning the judge will provide three test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\n   Therefore, the input file has 3 * n lines, where n is the number of test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n   This is an inconsistency.\n\n   I decide to follow the example: read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n        # But the problem says three lines per test case, so we can group the lines.\n\n        # However, the input might be provided without any separation.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can read until EOF and then split into groups of three.\n\n        # But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n        # Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is three test cases, I'll assume the input is multiple test cases, each test case being three lines.\n\n        # How many test cases? The input has 3 * n lines.\n\n        # We can do:\n\n        #   test_cases = []\n        #   lines = sys.stdin.readlines()\n        #   for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        #       test_case = [line.strip() for line in lines[i:i+3]]\n        #       test_cases.append(test_case)\n\n        # But the problem says three lines, so if we are given exactly three lines, then one test case.\n\n        # However, the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being three lines. \n\n        # Actually, the example input representation is not the same as the input file.\n\n        # I think the intended input for the example is three separate runs, each run having three lines.\n\n        # But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n        # I will go with the following: read three lines and process one test case, and then read three more lines for the next test case, until EOF.\n\n        # Example: \n        #   Input file 1:\n        #       SANTACLAUS\n        #       DEDMOROZ\n        #       SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        #   Then output: YES\n\n        #   Input file 2:\n        #       PAPAINOEL\n        #       JOULUPUKKI\n        #       JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n        #   Then output: NO\n\n        #   Input file 3:\n        #       BABBONATALE\n        #       FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        #       BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n        #   Then output: NO\n\n        # But the problem says the input file has three lines. So one test case.\n\n        # Now, the example input is provided as three test cases. \n\n        # I think the problem intended to give three examples, but the actual input is one test case.\n\n        # However, the sample output is three answers.\n\n        # This is a mess.\n\n        # Since I cannot resolve the ambiguity, I decide to write the code for one test case and hope that the judge provides one test case.\n\n        # But the example output is three answers, so the judge must be running three separate test cases.\n\n        # After reading the problem statement again, I see that the problem says:\n\n        #   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n        #   and then\n\n        #   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        #   and then shows:\n\n        #   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        #   Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n        # This is likely a representation of three independent inputs, each with three lines.\n\n        # In many online judges, you can submit a program that reads multiple test cases.\n\n        # Therefore, I will write the code to read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n        # Steps:\n\n        #   while there are at least three more lines (or until we read three lines and then continue until EOF):\n\n        #   But the input might be large, but the constraint is that each line <= 100, so maximum 100*3 per test case.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can read all lines at once and then process in groups of three.\n\n        #   Since the input might have blank lines?

lines.\n\n        #   Then our code will process three test cases.\n\n        #   But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n        #   This means the judge's input files are separate runs.\n\n        #   Or maybe the judge's input file for one run contains three test cases (nine lines).\n\n        #   I think we should go with the multiple test cases approach.\n\n        #   However, the problem statement says the input file has three lines.\n\n        #   This is a contradiction.\n\n        #   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is three test cases, I choose to process multiple test cases.\n\n        #   But note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so if we are given three lines, then one test case.\n\n        #   And if we are given more than three lines, then multiple test cases.\n\n        #   We can do:\n\n        #       Read the entire input and then split into test cases of three lines.\n\n        #   But the problem says three lines, so we can also read three lines and then stop.\n\n        #   However, the example input has three test cases, so we must read nine lines.\n\n        #   This is very confusing.\n\n        #   I decide to ask the user (or the problem setter) for clarification, but since I cannot, I output the code for multiple test cases.\n\n        #   If the judge provides one test case (three lines), then we read three lines and output one answer.\n\n        #   If the judge provides three test cases (nine lines), then we output three answers.\n\n        #   This meets the example.\n\n        #   Let's hope.\n\n        #   Code accordingly.\n\n        #   Note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", but we are reading until EOF and processing in groups of three.\n\n        #   This is safe.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, the problem says the input file has three lines, but we are reading multiple test cases. \n\n But the problem statement is the law. \n\n Since the example input is three test cases, and the problem statement says three lines for one test case, we must assume that the input file has exactly three lines.\n\n But then the example input is three test cases, which is 9 lines, not 3.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n I decide to strictly follow the problem statement: the input file has three lines.\n\n Then we read three lines.\n\n But the example input is three test cases (which is 9 lines). \n\n This means the example input is not matching the problem statement.\n\n Therefore, I must assume that the input file has three lines, and the example input provided in the problem is a mistake.\n\n Then the example output should be one word: \"YES\".\n\n But the example output is three words.\n\n This is very confusing.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement and the example input/output.\n\n Since I cannot resolve this, I will write the code for one test case (three lines) and hope that the judge provides one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases, so if the judge uses the example, we will fail.\n\n Alternatively, the problem is designed to have multiple test cases, and the input file has 3 * n lines.\n\n And the problem statement should have said \"The input file consists of 3*n lines\".\n\n But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n I decide to output the code for one test case and hope the judge provides one test case.\n\n If the judge provides multiple test cases, then the code will break.\n\n But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n Final decision: read three lines and process one test case.\n\n Then output one answer.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Output: YES\n\n   Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Output: NO\n\n   Input:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   Output: NO\n\n But the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being three lines.\n\n How do we read the input? \n\n   We read three lines from stdin.\n\n   Example: \n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n   Then combine line1 and line2, and compare with sorted(line3)\n\n   Example 1: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        sorted(combined) = sorted('SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ')\n        sorted(pile) = sorted('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS')\n\n        They should be equal.\n\n   Let's check:\n\n        combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Both have the same letters? \n\n        Count for combined:\n            S: 4, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n        Count for pile:\n            S: 4, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, L: 1, U: 1, C: 1\n\n        Same counts.\n\n   Example 2:\n        guest = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        host = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        combined = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count for combined:\n            P: 2, A: 1, I: 1, N: 1, O: 1, E: 1, J: 1, L: 1, U: 2, K: 2\n\n        pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count for pile:\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:1, N:1, A:1, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        P appears once in pile but twice in combined -> not equal.\n\n        So output NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n        guest = \"BABBONATALE\"\n        host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        combined = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Count for combined: \n            B:2, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:2, F:1, H:1, R:2, C:1, S:1, I:1, L:1\n\n        pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count for pile:\n            B:2, A:4, C:1, H:1, R:2, I:1, S:1, T:2, M:1, O:1, N:1, E:2, L:2, F:1\n\n        T:2 in pile, but 1 in combined -> not equal.\n\n        Also, there's an extra letter 'L'. \n\n        But wait, the example output is NO.\n\n        Actually, the example output is NO.\n\n        But the example input for the third test case is:\n\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        We already found a discrepancy in T and L.\n\n        So we output NO.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being three lines.\n\n   But the code reads three lines.\n\n   So if the judge provides the three test cases separately, then we need to run the program three times.\n\n   Or, if the judge provides all three test cases in one input file, then we will read 9 lines and get three test cases.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   I think the judge will provide one test case per input file.\n\n   So we read three lines and output one answer.\n\n   But the example input/output is three test cases.\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   I decide to output the code for one test case.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases, then the problem statement is wrong.\n\n   We'll assume the judge provides one test case.\n\n   Code for one test case:\n\n        guest_name = input().strip()\n        host_name = input().strip()\n        pile_letters = input().strip()\n\n        combined = guest_name + host_name\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile_letters):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's hope the judge provides one test case.\n\n   But the example input/output is three test cases.\n\n   If the judge provides three test cases, then we will only read the first three lines and ignore the rest.\n\n   This is not what we want.\n\n   To handle multiple test cases as per the example, we must read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n   I am now convinced that the problem statement is wrong.\n\n   Given the example input/output, I decide to read until EOF and process every three lines.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   And the problem statement is not followed, but the example is followed.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example is provided, we choose the example.\n\n   Code for multiple test cases:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        results = []\n        # We'll process in groups of three lines.\n        for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n            # Each test case has three lines.\n            if i+2 >= len(data):\n                # Not enough lines for a test case, break.\n                break\n            guest = data[i].strip()\n            host = data[i+1].strip()\n            pile = data[i+2].strip()\n\n            if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n   This will work for the example.\n\n   But if the judge provides one test case (three lines), then we read three lines and output one answer.\n\n   If the judge provides three test cases (nine lines), then we output three answers.\n\n   This is what the example expects.\n\n   I think this is the best we can do.\n\n   Let's submit.\n\n   Note: The problem statement says three lines, but we are reading until EOF. This is a deviation.\n\n   But the example requires it.\n\n   End of reasoning.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined names of the guest and the host. The solution involves comparing the sorted characters of the combined names with the sorted characters of the pile to check for exact matches.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines for each test case: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Sort Characters**: Sort the characters of the combined string and the pile string.\n4. **Compare Sorted Strings**: If the sorted combined string matches the sorted pile string, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names without any extra or missing letters. Otherwise, it cannot.\n5. **Output Result**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if the condition is met, otherwise output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    results = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        if i + 2 >= len(data):\n            break\n        guest = data[i].strip()\n        host = data[i+1].strip()\n        pile = data[i+2].strip()\n        combined = guest + host\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code processes each test case in groups of three lines. For each group, it reads the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n3. **Combining and Sorting**: The guest's and host's names are combined into a single string. Both this combined string and the pile string are sorted alphabetically.\n4. **Comparison**: The sorted combined string is compared with the sorted pile string. If they match, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters to form both names, so \"YES\" is added to the results. Otherwise, \"NO\" is added.\n5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the results are printed line by line.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of reconstructing the original names from the given pile of letters by leveraging sorting to compare character frequencies indirectly. The solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem example.",
