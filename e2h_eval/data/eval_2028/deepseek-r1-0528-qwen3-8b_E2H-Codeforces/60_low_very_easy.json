Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S (in Morse code).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We know that the Morse code strings for letters are of length 1 to 4, and there are 30 possible binary strings (with '0' for dot and '1' for dash) but 4 are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n 2. However, note that a substring of S might be longer than 4? Actually, we can only consider contiguous substrings that are of length 1 to 4 because the representation for a letter must be in that range.\n\n 3. But note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". This means we are allowed to break the substring into consecutive letters? Actually, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\n    However, reading the example: \n        After S = \"111\", the substrings we consider are:\n          - \"1\" -> T\n          - \"11\" -> M\n          - \"111\" -> O\n\n        Then, the sequences are built from these letters. But note: the example lists \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", etc.\n\n    How do we form the sequences? We can take any contiguous substring of S, and if that substring (which is a string of dots and dashes) can be broken down into one or more valid Morse code letters (each of length 1 to 4) then that entire substring represents a sequence of letters.\n\n    However, note: the example does not require that the entire substring is broken down in multiple ways. Actually, the problem states: \"represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". \n\n    Let me clarify: The substring itself must represent a sequence of letters. But note that the Morse code for a letter is a fixed string. So the substring must be decomposed into consecutive valid Morse code strings (each of length 1 to 4) without gaps.\n\n    But wait: the example includes \"TT\", which is two T's. The substring \"11\" (which is the entire string) can be broken as \"1\" and then \"1\", so two T's.\n\n    However, note that \"11\" is also the representation of the letter M. So the same substring can be interpreted in two ways: as one letter or two letters? \n\n    The problem does not specify whether we consider the substring as being broken arbitrarily or as being the concatenation of letters. But note: the example counts both the single-letter and multi-letter sequences.\n\n    Therefore, the idea is: we are to count every distinct sequence (as a string of letters) that appears as a substring (contiguous) of S, but each contiguous substring must be decomposable into valid Morse code letters (each of which is one of the 26 valid ones). However, the same substring might be broken in multiple ways? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". This means that the substring must be the concatenation of the Morse codes of the letters. And the Morse code of a letter is fixed (so we have a fixed mapping from a string of 1 to 4 bits to a letter). \n\n    However, the problem does not require that the entire substring is broken into letters in only one way. Actually, the same substring might be broken in multiple ways, and each way gives a different sequence of letters. But note: the example \"11\" is broken as two T's (so the sequence \"TT\") and also as one M. So the substring \"11\" corresponds to two different sequences: \"M\" and \"TT\".\n\n    But wait: the example output after \"111\" is 7. The example lists:\n        \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n    So indeed, the substring \"1\" gives \"T\", substring \"11\" gives \"M\" and also \"TT\", substring \"111\" gives \"O\", \"TTM\" is not valid because we don't have a letter \"TTM\", but note: we are breaking the substring \"111\" as three T's: \"TTT\".\n\n    However, note that the substring \"111\" can be broken as:\n        - Three T's: \"T\" + \"T\" + \"T\"\n        - Or one M and then one T: \"MT\" (but M is two bits, so the first two bits form M, then the last one forms T)\n        - Or one T and then one M: \"TM\" (first one T, then the next two form M)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, where each letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1 to 4. The Morse code strings use '0' for dots and '1' for dashes, and certain 4-bit strings are invalid (not corresponding to any English letter).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any valid sequence of letters must be formed by contiguous substrings of S that can be broken down into valid Morse code strings (each of length 1 to 4). Each valid substring contributes one or more sequences depending on how it can be segmented into valid Morse codes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp[i]` to store the number of valid sequences ending at position `i-1` in the string S. This helps in efficiently counting sequences by leveraging previously computed results.\n3. **Handling Valid Segments**: For each position in S, we check all possible segments ending at that position (from length 1 to 4) to see if they form valid Morse code strings. If a segment is valid, we update the DP array based on the validity of the segment and previous segments.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    chars = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+m]]\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_i = chars[i - 1]\n        if s_i == '0':\n            current_bit = 0\n        else:\n            current_bit = 1\n        \n        # Check segments of length 1 to 4 ending at position i\n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = i - length\n            if start_index < 0:\n                break\n            \n            mask = 0\n            j = start_index\n            while j < i:\n                if chars[j] == '0':\n                    bit_val = 0\n                else:\n                    bit_val = 1\n                mask = (mask << 1) | bit_val\n                j += 1\n            \n            if mask == 0:\n                continue\n                \n            if mask == 0b1111 or mask == 0b0011 or mask == 0b0101 or mask == 0b1110:\n                continue\n                \n            if length == 1:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n            elif length == 2:\n                if start_index - 1 >= 0:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[start_index - 1]) % MOD\n            elif length == 3:\n                if start_index - 1 >= 0:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[start_index - 1]) % MOD\n            else:  # length == 4\n                if start_index - 1 >= 0:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[start_index - 1]) % MOD\n        \n        total_ans = 0\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if j == 1:\n                total_ans = (total_ans + 1) % MOD\n            else:\n                total_ans = (total_ans + dp[j]) % MOD\n        ans.append(total_ans)\n    \n    for a in ans:\n        print(a)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes a DP array to keep track of valid sequences ending at each position.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string S, the code checks all possible segments ending at the current position (lengths 1 to 4) to determine if they form valid Morse code strings.\n3. **Updating DP Array**: If a segment is valid, the DP array is updated based on the segment's length. For segments of length 1, it directly increments the count. For longer segments, it uses previous DP values to account for multiple valid segmentations.\n4. **Calculating Total Sequences**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences up to that point is calculated by summing up all valid sequences from the DP array and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and careful handling of segment validity, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
