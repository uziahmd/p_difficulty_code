You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits, but each digit in s can be used only once.\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n We have two strings: \n   a: the original number (as string) of length n.\n   s: the sequence of digits (as string) of length m.\n\n Since we can use each digit in s at most once, we can choose at most m replacements.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to skip some operations. We want to maximize the number.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We cannot change the order of digits. We can only replace some digits.\n\n 2. The idea: We want to assign the available digits from s to positions in a such that the overall number becomes maximum.\n\n 3. Consider: We can think greedily from left to right. For the leftmost digit, we want the highest possible digit, but note: sometimes we may want to keep a lower digit if we have a limited set of high digits and we have many positions to fill.\n\n 4. However, note: we are allowed to use each element of s at most once, and we can choose any subset of s. We are going to consider the following:\n\n    - We have a multiset of replacement digits (each digit from s).\n\n    - We can also consider that we might not replace a digit if it doesn't help.\n\n 5. But note: we are allowed to do replacements arbitrarily (any position). The catch: we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n 6. How to approach?\n\n    We are going to try to replace as many digits as possible, but we care about the magnitude.\n\n    Important: The leftmost digit has the highest weight. So we want to assign the largest available digit to the leftmost position? Not necessarily: sometimes we might have a situation where we have two large digits, but we can only use one. However, we must compare the current digit with the available ones.\n\n    However, note: we cannot break the rule of leading zeros. But the input doesn't contain leading zeros, so the original number doesn't start with zero. However, if we replace the first digit by a zero, then we get a leading zero which is not allowed? Actually, the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeros.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes\". So the original a doesn't have leading zeros. But after replacement, we must avoid having a leading zero.\n\n    So for the first digit, we can only replace it with a digit from '1' to '9' (if we choose to replace the first digit). However, if the first digit is already non-zero, then we can consider replacing it with a higher digit or even a lower one? But we want to maximize the number. We never want to lower the first digit unless forced by the available digits? Actually, we can choose to not replace the first digit if we don't have a better digit.\n\n    However, the goal is maximum value. We want the leftmost digit as high as possible. But what if we have a '9' in the first digit? Then we don't need to replace. But what if we have a '1' in the first digit and we have a '9' available? Then we should replace.\n\n    But note: we have multiple digits to replace. We are limited by the set s.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can consider:\n\n      Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n      Step 2: Traverse the digits of a from left to right.\n\n        At each position i, we consider:\n\n          Option 1: Do nothing if the current digit is already the best we can get.\n\n          Option 2: Replace the current digit with a better digit from s.\n\n        But note: we cannot use the same digit from s twice.\n\n    However, we have a fixed multiset of s. We can sort the digits in s, but we also have to consider that we can use each digit only once.\n\n    Let's break down:\n\n      We want to maximize the number. The leftmost digit is the most significant.\n\n      We can precompute:\n\n        Let freq be a dictionary (or list of counts) for digits from '0' to '9' in s.\n\n      Then, we traverse the digits of a from left to right. At each position, we try to see if we can replace the current digit with a digit from '9' down to '0' (if we have available) but we must leave enough for the remaining positions.\n\n      However, the problem: we have a fixed set of digits. We can use each at most once.\n\n      But note: the entire set s is available for all positions.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: we cannot use the same digit twice.\n\n      But there is a caveat: if we use a digit for a left position, then we lose the chance to use it for a right position.\n\n      How to decide? We want to use the best digits as left as possible.\n\n      However, sometimes we might have an option: we have two positions that can be improved, and we have two digits: say '9' and '8'. We would put '9' at the leftmost and '8' at the next. But what if we have an even better digit for a later position? We don't because we are going from left to right.\n\n      But note: we are free to assign any digit from s to any position. We are not forced to use the digits in the order of s.\n\n      So the algorithm:\n\n        Let a_str = string of the original number.\n\n        Let s_str = string of the replacement digits.\n\n        Build a frequency array for s_str for digits '0' to '9'.\n\n        We are going to try to replace the digits from left to right.\n\n        However, we cannot simply assign the highest available digit at each step because:\n\n          Example: \n            a_str = \"199\"\n            s_str = \"9\"\n\n          If we replace the first '1' with '9', we get \"999\", which is good.\n\n          But if we don't replace the first digit, then we get \"99\" from the two last digits? Actually, we have only one '9'. We can only replace one digit. So we must use the '9' on the first digit.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            a_str = \"199\"\n            s_str = \"8\"\n\n          Then we cannot improve the first digit (because 8 < 1? Actually, 8 > 1) but wait: we can replace the first digit with 8? Then we get \"899\", which is less than the original \"199\"? No, wait: 899 is greater than 199? Actually, no: 199 is one hundred ninety-nine, and 899 is eight hundred ninety-nine -> so yes, 899 > 199. But wait, that's correct.\n\n        However, consider:\n\n            a_str = \"909\"\n            s_str = \"9\"\n\n          We have a '9' in the first digit, so we don't need to replace the first. Then we can use the '9' for the middle digit? The middle digit is '0'. Replacing it with '9' gives \"999\", which is better. But wait: we are allowed to use the same digit set for any position. So we can choose to replace the middle digit even if the first digit is already '9'. \n\n        However, note: the problem says we can choose any position arbitrarily. So we are not forced to replace from left to right. We can choose any positions.\n\n        But the problem: we are allowed to use each element of s at most once, and we can choose the order arbitrarily.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: we have a multiset of replacement digits (from s) and we can assign them to any positions (each at most once) to maximize the number.\n\n        This is similar to: we want to assign the best available digits to the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n        However, we can also consider: what if we have a very large digit, but we have two positions: one that can be improved by a small amount and one by a large amount? We should use the large digit on the leftmost position that is currently holding a low digit.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n          Step 2: We'll create an array for the result, initially the original a.\n\n          Step 3: We'll try to improve the number from left to right. But we have a fixed multiset of improvements.\n\n          However, note: we can also consider that we might want to save a high digit for a later position that is very low.\n\n          But the leftmost position is the most significant. So we want to assign the highest available digit to the first position that we can improve, then the next highest to the next position, etc.\n\n          But wait: what if we have two options:\n\n            Position 0: current digit is '1', we have a '9' and a '2'\n            Position 1: current digit is '0', we have a '9' and a '2'\n\n          Then we have two choices:\n\n            Option 1: Assign '9' to position0 and '2' to position1 -> \"92\" (but wait, the rest of the number is fixed? Actually, we are building the whole number.)\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to use the entire set of s. We are going to use as many as we can, but we must use the best ones first for the leftmost positions.\n\n          How to do:\n\n            We are going to consider: for each position, we can replace it if we have a digit that is strictly greater than the current one. But we have a multiset.\n\n            However, we have a fixed set of digits. We can sort the available digits in descending order and then assign the largest available digit to the leftmost position that we can improve, then the next largest to the next leftmost, etc.\n\n          But caution: we cannot assign a digit that is not greater than the current one? Actually, we can assign a digit that is less than the current one, but that would decrease the number. Why would we do that? We wouldn't. So we only consider replacing when the available digit is strictly greater.\n\n          However, wait: sometimes we might have an opportunity to use a digit that is equal? Actually, if we have a '1' and we have a '1', then replacing doesn't change the value. But we are allowed to use the replacement, and then we use up the '1'. But if we use a '1' for this position, then we cannot use it for a later position that might need a '1' to replace a '0' (which would be beneficial). So we should avoid replacing with an equal digit unless we have to? Actually, no: we can skip using the '1' for this position and use it for a later one.\n\n          Therefore, we only consider replacing with a digit strictly greater than the current.\n\n          But then, how do we use the available digits?\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let available = sorted list (descending) of the digits in s.\n\n            However, we cannot simply assign the largest available digit to the first position that can be improved because we might have multiple positions that can be improved and we want to use the largest digit for the leftmost position.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              For each position i (from left to right), we check: what is the maximum digit we can assign that is greater than the current one and is still available? But then we remove that digit.\n\n            However, we have a multiset. We can precompute the available digits and then for each position, we look for the smallest digit that is greater than the current one (to minimize the waste of large digits). But wait: we want to maximize the entire number.\n\n            Actually, we want to assign the largest available digit that is greater than the current one? Because we want the leftmost digit to be as large as possible.\n\n            But consider: \n\n                a_str = \"19\"\n                s_str = \"29\"\n\n                Option 1: Use '9' for the first digit -> \"99\"\n                Option 2: Use '2' for the first digit -> \"29\", then use '9' for the second? But the second digit is '9', so we don't need to replace. So we get \"29\".\n\n                Clearly, \"99\" is better.\n\n            But now consider:\n\n                a_str = \"19\"\n                s_str = \"92\"\n\n                Same as above: we have '9' and '2'. We can assign the '9' to the first digit.\n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"19\"\n                s_str = \"89\"\n\n                Then we have two digits: '8' and '9'. We can assign '9' to the first digit -> \"99\", or assign '8' to the first digit -> \"89\", and then we have '9' for the second? The second digit is '9', so no improvement. So \"99\" is better.\n\n            So the plan:\n\n              We are going to traverse the digits of a from left to right, and for each digit, we will consider:\n\n                If there exists any digit in s (that we haven't used) that is greater than the current digit, then we will replace the current digit with the maximum digit available that is greater than the current digit? But wait, we want to use the largest digit for the leftmost position.\n\n              However, we have multiple digits. We can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n                Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n                Then, we try to replace the leftmost digit that can be improved by the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But that might not be optimal: because we might have a very large digit that we use for the first digit, but then we don't have enough for the subsequent digits.\n\n              Alternatively, we can think: we want to use the available digits to maximize the number. The standard way is:\n\n                We are going to consider: for the first digit, we want the highest digit we can get. The highest digit we can get is min('9', max_digit_available) but note: we might have to reserve some digits for later.\n\n              Actually, we can use a two-pass method:\n\n                Pass 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n                Pass 2: Traverse from left to right and try to replace the digit with the highest available digit that is greater than the current one, but without worrying about the future (because we are going to use the best available for the current position). However, we must leave the remaining digits for the rest of the positions.\n\n              But here is a catch: we are allowed to use any subset. So we want to assign the best digits to the leftmost positions that are improvable.\n\n              Standard solution for such problems (like \"Make the largest number with a set of digits and a fixed number\") is:\n\n                We are going to try to build the number from left to right. At each position, we consider: what is the best digit we can put here?\n\n                The best digit we can put is the largest digit available that is >= the current digit? But wait, if we put a digit that is larger, then we improve the number. But if we put a digit that is equal, we don't change the number but we use up a digit that might be needed for a later position.\n\n                However, we are allowed to skip replacements. So we don't have to use every digit.\n\n              But note: we are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n              Therefore, we can decide to replace a digit if and only if the replacement digit is strictly greater than the current one.\n\n              Then, the problem becomes: we have a multiset of digits (from s) that we can use to replace some digits in a, but we can only replace a digit if the replacement digit is strictly greater than the current one, and we want to maximize the resulting number.\n\n              However, we can also consider: what if we have a digit that is equal? Then we can choose to use it or not. But if we use an equal digit, we don't improve the current digit, but we use up one occurrence of that digit. That might prevent us from improving a later digit that is currently lower.\n\n              Example:\n\n                a_str = \"10\"\n                s_str = \"1\"\n\n                Here, we have a '1' in s. The first digit is '1'. We can replace the first digit with '1' (no change). But then we have the second digit '0'. We don't have any other digit. So the result is \"10\".\n\n                Alternatively, we can choose not to replace the first digit and not use the '1'. Then we have no replacement. So same result.\n\n                Now, consider:\n\n                a_str = \"10\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n                Then we cannot replace the first digit because '0' is less than '1'. We cannot replace the second digit because we don't have a digit that is strictly greater than '0'? Actually, we have one digit '0'. But replacing the second digit with '0' doesn't change it. So we skip.\n\n                But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"10\"\n                s_str = \"01\"\n\n                Now, we have two digits: '0' and '1'. We can use the '1' for the first digit? Then we replace the first digit (which is '1') with '1' -> no change. Then we have the second digit: we have a '0' left. We cannot replace the second digit with '0' because 0<=0 (so no improvement). So we get \"10\".\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the '0' for the first digit? Then we get \"00\", which is invalid (leading zero). So we cannot do that.\n\n                But wait, we are allowed to use any subset. So we can choose to use the '1' for the second digit? The second digit is '0'. We can replace the second digit with '1' (which is >0). Then the number becomes \"11\". But note: we didn't use the '0'. So we can do that.\n\n                Therefore, we must consider: we are allowed to choose any subset. So we can skip the digits we don't want.\n\n                Revised plan:\n\n                  We are going to consider: we have a multiset of digits (s). We can use each at most once.\n\n                  We want to maximize the number. We can break the process into two parts:\n\n                    Part 1: We can replace any digit in a with a digit from s, but only if the replacement digit is strictly greater than the current digit (to avoid making the number smaller) and we cannot break the leading zero rule (so the first digit cannot be replaced by a '0').\n\n                  But note: sometimes we might have the option to replace a digit with a digit that is not strictly greater but we are forced to use a digit that is available and we are trying to use the available digits optimally? Actually, no: because if we don't replace, we keep the original digit. And if we replace with a digit that is not strictly greater, we are making the digit smaller or same. So we only consider replacements that are strictly greater.\n\n                  However, wait: what if the current digit is '0' and we have a '0' in s? Then replacing with '0' doesn't change the digit, so we don't need to use it. But if we have a digit that is greater than '0', we can use it to replace the '0' and improve the number.\n\n                  But the problem: we are allowed to skip. So we only use a digit from s if it is strictly greater than the current digit.\n\n                  Then the problem becomes: we have a multiset of digits (from s) and we can assign each digit to any position (if the digit is greater than the current digit at that position). We want to maximize the number.\n\n                  How to do it?\n\n                    We want to assign the best digits (largest) to the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n                    Steps:\n\n                      1. Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n                      2. We are going to traverse the digits of a from left to right.\n\n                      3. For each digit, we consider: we want to replace it with the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit. But we must leave enough for the rest of the positions.\n\n                    However, we don't know the future. But note: the rest of the positions are independent. We can use a greedy algorithm that uses the largest available digit for the current position if it is greater than the current digit, and then update the available digits.\n\n                    But wait: we have a multiset. We can use a priority queue for the available digits.\n\n                    However, we have to consider that we are allowed to skip some replacements. But we want to maximize the number.\n\n                    Algorithm:\n\n                      Let freq be an array (size 10) for digits '0' to '9'. We'll map digit '0' to index 0, ..., '9' to index 9.\n\n                      Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n                      Step 2: Convert the original number a to a list of characters.\n\n                      Step 3: We'll create an array for the result, initially the original a.\n\n                      Step 4: We'll consider two types of improvements:\n\n                          a) We can improve a digit by replacing it with a strictly greater digit from s.\n\n                          b) But we must consider that we might have multiple improvements and we want to use the best digits first.\n\n                      However, we can do:\n\n                        We are going to try to replace the leftmost digit that we can with the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. Then move to the next.\n\n                      But consider: we have two digits in a and two digits in s.\n\n                        Example: a_str = \"19\", s_str = \"92\"\n\n                        We have two digits: '9' and '2'. \n\n                        For the first digit '1': we can replace with '9' (since 9>1) and then we have '2' left for the second digit? The second digit is '9', so we cannot replace. So we get \"99\".\n\n                        But what if we use the '2' for the first digit? Then the first digit becomes '2', and then we have '9' for the second digit: but the second digit is '9', so no improvement. Then we get \"29\", which is worse.\n\n                      So we must use the largest available digit for the leftmost position that can be improved.\n\n                      However, we have to consider: we are allowed to use the digits in any order. So we can use the largest digit for the first position if it is greater, and then the next largest for the second, etc.\n\n                      But note: we cannot use a digit more than once.\n\n                      So:\n\n                        Let available_digits = sorted list of the digits in s (we can use a max-heap or just sort and then use two pointers? But we have to update counts).\n\n                      Alternatively, we can precompute the maximum digit available that is greater than the current one, but we must use the largest one because we want the highest value.\n\n                      Steps:\n\n                        We'll use an array (or list) for the counts of each digit.\n\n                        We'll traverse from left to right:\n\n                          For each position i with digit d (current):\n\n                            We want to find the largest digit x (from '9' down to d+1) that has count > 0.\n\n                            If we find one, then we replace the current digit with x, and decrement the count of x.\n\n                            Otherwise, we leave the digit as is.\n\n                        But wait: is that always optimal?\n\n                        Consider: \n\n                            a_str = \"123\"\n                            s_str = \"391\"\n\n                        Steps:\n\n                            Counts: \n                                '1':1, '2':0, '3':1, '9':1\n\n                            Position0: digit '1'. \n                                The largest digit greater than '1' is '9' -> use '9'. Then we update: counts become '1':1, '3':1, '9':0.\n                                Now the number becomes \"923\".\n\n                            Position1: digit '2'. \n                                The largest digit greater than '2' is '3' -> use '3'. Then counts: '1':1, '3':0, '9':0.\n                                Now the number becomes \"933\".\n\n                            Position2: digit '3'. \n                                We look for a digit greater than '3'. None. So remains '3'.\n\n                            Result: \"933\".\n\n                        But what if we didn't use the '9' for the first digit?\n\n                            Instead, we use the '9' for the second digit? \n\n                            Then:\n\n                                Position0: digit '1'. \n                                    We could use '3' (which is >1) -> then we get \"323\", and then use '9' for the second digit: but the second digit is '2', so we replace with '9' -> \"393\", and then the third digit: we have '1' left, but 1<=3 so we don't use it.\n\n                            Compare: \"933\" vs \"393\": 933 is bigger.\n\n                        So the above greedy (using the largest available digit at each step) is correct.\n\n                        However, consider:\n\n                            a_str = \"123\"\n                            s_str = \"39\"\n\n                        Then:\n\n                            Counts: '3':1, '9':1\n\n                            Position0: digit '1'. \n                                Largest digit > '1' is '9'. Use '9'. Then counts: '3':1, '9':0.\n                                Number becomes \"923\"\n\n                            Position1: digit '2'. \n                                Largest digit > '2' is '3'. Use '3'. Then counts: '3':0, '9':0.\n                                Number becomes \"933\"\n\n                            Position2: digit '3'. \n                                No digit greater than '3'\n\n                            Result: \"933\"\n\n                        But wait, what if we use the '9' for the second digit and the '3' for the first?\n\n                            Position0: digit '1'. \n                                We use '3' (which is >1) -> \"323\", then use '9' for the second digit: \"393\", then the third digit remains '3' -> \"393\".\n\n                            \"933\" is greater than \"393\", so the first method is better.\n\n                        Therefore, the greedy of using the largest available digit at each position is optimal.\n\n                        Why? Because the leftmost digit has the highest weight. We want the highest digit at the leftmost position. Then, with the remaining digits, we do the same for the next.\n\n                        But note: we are allowed to use any digit from s for any position. The above greedy does not consider the possibility of saving a large digit for a later position that might have a very low digit.\n\n                        Example:\n\n                            a_str = \"199\"\n                            s_str = \"9\"\n\n                            Using the greedy:\n\n                                Position0: digit '1'. We have '9' (which is >1). Use '9'. Then the number becomes \"999\".\n\n                            This is optimal.\n\n                        Another example:\n\n                            a_str = \"199\"\n                            s_str = \"8\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: digit '1'. We have '8' (which is >1). Use '8'. Then the number becomes \"899\".\n\n                            This is optimal.\n\n                        But consider:\n\n                            a_str = \"789\"\n                            s_str = \"98\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: digit '7'. The largest digit in s is '9' (which is >7). Use '9'. Then s becomes ['8'].\n                                Then the number is \"989\".\n\n                            But if we use the '8' for the first digit and the '9' for the second:\n\n                                Position0: use '8' -> \"889\", then position1: we have '9' and the current digit is '8'. Use '9' -> \"899\", then position2: remains '9'. -> \"899\"\n\n                            Now, compare \"989\" and \"899\": 989 is bigger.\n\n                        So the greedy (using the largest available digit for the current position) is indeed optimal.\n\n                        However, wait: what if we have:\n\n                            a_str = \"123\"\n                            s_str = \"43\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: digit '1'. The largest digit in s is '4' (which is >1). Use '4'. Then s becomes [3].\n                                Then the number is \"423\".\n\n                            But if we use the '3' for the first digit and the '4' for the second:\n\n                                Position0: use '3' -> \"323\", then position1: use '4' (since 4>2) -> \"343\", then position2: remains '3'. -> \"343\"\n\n                            Compare: \"423\" vs \"343\": 423 is bigger.\n\n                        So the greedy is still better.\n\n                        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n                          Step 1: Read the two strings.\n\n                          Step 2: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n                          Step 3: Convert a to a list of characters.\n\n                          Step 4: For i in range(len(a)):\n                            current_digit = a[i]\n                            # We are going to look for the largest digit in the available set that is greater than current_digit.\n\n                            # But note: we don't want to use a digit that is not available.\n\n                            # We can iterate from '9' down to str(int(current_digit)+1) (but we have to consider the digit as character)\n\n                            # However, we have a frequency array. We can iterate from '9' down to the next digit above current_digit.\n\n                            # But note: the digits are characters. We can convert to int.\n\n                            Let d = int(current_digit)\n\n                            We'll consider digits from 9 down to d+1 (inclusive). For each digit value x (from 9 down to d+1):\n\n                              If we have at least one occurrence of the digit representing x, then we use one occurrence, replace the current_digit with str(x), and break.\n\n                            Then we continue.\n\n                          Step 5: Print the resulting string.\n\n                        However, the above greedy does not consider the possibility of using a digit that is not the largest for the current position if we can use the largest for a later position that is more critical? \n\n                        Let me think: \n\n                            Example: \n\n                                a_str = \"19\"\n                                s_str = \"91\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: current_digit '1'. We have two digits: '9' and '1'. The largest digit greater than '1' is '9'. We use '9'. Then the number becomes \"99\", and we are done.\n\n                            But wait, we have a '1' left. We don't need it.\n\n                            Example: \n\n                                a_str = \"19\"\n                                s_str = \"99\"\n\n                            Then we use the first '9' for the first digit, then we have another '9' for the second digit? But the second digit is '9', so we don't need to replace. But we are allowed to skip. So we get \"99\".\n\n                        But consider a different example:\n\n                            a_str = \"155\"\n                            s_str = \"65\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: '1'. We have digits ['6','5'] -> the largest digit greater than '1' is '6'. Use '6'. Then we have ['5'].\n\n                                Then the number becomes \"655\".\n\n                            But what if we don't use the '6' for the first digit? \n\n                                Then we use the '5' for the first digit? But 5>1, so we can use it. Then we get \"555\", and then we have a '6' left for the second digit? The second digit is '5', so we can use '6' -> \"565\", and the third digit is '5', we can use nothing (since we have no more) -> \"565\".\n\n                            Compare: \"655\" vs \"565\": 655 is bigger.\n\n                        So the greedy is still correct.\n\n                        However, note: we are allowed to use any subset. So we can choose to use the '6' for the first digit and not use the '5' for the first digit, and then use the '5' for the second digit? But the greedy does that: it uses the largest available for the first digit.\n\n                        But wait, the greedy uses the largest available for the first digit, and then for the second digit, we have the remaining digits. In the above example, after using '6', we have ['5'] and then for the second digit (which is '5') we don't have a digit greater than '5', so we leave it. But we have a '5' in s, but we don't use it because 5 is not strictly greater than 5.\n\n                        However, the example I did above was: use the '5' for the first digit and then the '6' for the second. But that is a different assignment. But note: the greedy doesn't consider that. It uses the largest available for the first digit, and then for the second digit, we have the remaining set. \n\n                        Why is that acceptable? Because the leftmost digit is the most significant. We want the highest digit at the leftmost. Then the next, etc.\n\n                        But what if we have:\n\n                            a_str = \"123\"\n                            s_str = \"321\"\n\n                            We want to maximize the number.\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: '1'. The available digits: ['3','2','1']. The largest digit greater than '1' is '3'. Use '3'. Then the number becomes \"323\", and we have ['2','1'] left.\n\n                                Then for position1: '2'. The available digits: ['2','1']. The largest digit greater than '2' is none. So we leave it.\n\n                                Then for position2: '3'. The available digits: ['1'] -> no digit greater than '3'. So we leave it.\n\n                                Result: \"323\"\n\n                            But what if we assign differently?\n\n                                Option: \n                                  Use the '2' for the first digit? Then we get \"223\", and then use the '3' for the second digit: \"233\", and then use the '1' for the third? -> \"233\", but wait: the third digit is '3', so we don't need to replace. \n\n                                Compare: \"323\" vs \"233\": 323 is bigger.\n\n                            So the greedy is correct.\n\n                        But wait: what if we have:\n\n                            a_str = \"149\"\n                            s_str = \"94\"\n\n                            Greedy:\n\n                                Position0: '1'. The largest digit in s is '9' (greater than '1'). Use '9'. Then the number becomes \"949\", and we have ['4'].\n\n                                Then position1: '4'. We have '4' (not strictly greater) so we don't use it. Then position2: '9', no digit greater.\n\n                                Result: \"949\"\n\n                            Alternative:\n\n                                Use the '4' for the first digit: \"449\", and then use the '9' for the second digit: \"499\". \n\n                                Compare: \"949\" vs \"499\": 949 is bigger.\n\n                        So the greedy is correct.\n\n                        However, consider:\n\n                            a_str = \"155\"\n                            s_str = \"65\"\n\n                            We saw that the greedy produces \"655\", which is correct.\n\n                        But note: we are not forced to use the entire set s. We only use the digits that are strictly greater.\n\n                        However, there is an issue: we are allowed to use the same digit multiple times? No, each element in s can be used at most once.\n\n                        Implementation:\n\n                            We have a frequency array for digits from '0' to '9'. We can use a list `freq` of size 10.\n\n                            Steps:\n\n                                freq = [0]*10\n                                for char in s_str:\n                                    freq[int(char)] += 1\n\n                                a_list = list(a_str)\n\n                                for i in range(len(a_list)):\n                                    # current digit as integer\n                                    d = int(a_list[i])\n                                    # We are going to look for the largest digit from 9 down to d+1\n                                    found = False\n                                    for x in range(9, d, -1):   # x from 9 down to d+1 (inclusive)\n                                        if freq[x] > 0:\n                                            # Use one occurrence of x\n                                            a_list[i] = str(x)\n                                            freq[x] -= 1\n                                            found = True\n                                            break\n\n                                    # If we didn't find any, then we leave the digit as is.\n\n                                Then print ''.join(a_list)\n\n                        However, consider: what if the current digit is '9'? Then we look for x from 9 down to 10 (which is out of range). So the loop doesn't run. Correct.\n\n                        But what if the current digit is '0'? Then d=0, and we look for x from 9 down to 1. But we must be cautious: if we replace the first digit (which is '0') with a digit from 1 to 9, that would make the number have a leading zero? Actually, the original number doesn't have leading zeros, but if the first digit is '0', then we are in a situation where the original number had a leading zero? According to the problem: \"The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes.\" So the first digit is not '0'. \n\n                        But wait, what if the number has more than one digit and the first digit is not '0', but a later digit is '0'? Then we can replace the '0' with a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that the leftmost digits have the highest weight in determining the number's value, so we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible digits from the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves transforming the original number into the largest possible number by strategically replacing its digits. Each replacement must use a digit from the sequence exactly once, and only digits strictly greater than the current digit can be used for replacement.\n2. **Intuition**: The leftmost digits significantly impact the number's value. Therefore, we should process each digit from left to right, replacing it with the largest available digit from the sequence that is greater than the current digit. This greedy approach ensures the highest possible value at each position, leading to the maximum overall number.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: Use an array to count occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the sequence.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, replace it with the largest available digit from the sequence that is greater than the current digit. Decrement the count of the used digit in the frequency array.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit in the original number once (O(n)) and checks up to 9 possible digits (O(1)) for each position, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for large inputs (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    freq = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        freq[digit] += 1\n            \n    a_list = list(a_str)\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        d = int(a_list[i])\n        for x in range(9, d, -1):\n            if freq[x] > 0:\n                a_list[i] = str(x)\n                freq[x] -= 1\n                break\n                \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The original number (`a_str`) and the sequence of digits (`s_str`) are read from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Array Setup**: An array `freq` of size 10 (digits 0-9) is initialized to zero. Each digit in `s_str` increments the corresponding index in `freq`.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in `a_str` (processed left to right), the algorithm checks digits from 9 down to one more than the current digit. If a larger digit is found in `freq`, it replaces the current digit, decrements the count of that digit in `freq`, and moves to the next position.\n4. **Output**: The modified list of digits is joined into a string and printed, representing the largest possible number after all valid replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging a greedy strategy and a frequency array to track available digits, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
