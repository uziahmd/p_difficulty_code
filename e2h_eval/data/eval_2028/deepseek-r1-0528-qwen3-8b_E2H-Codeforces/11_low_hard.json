A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime and the drink and salt per toast is for one friend. However, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. So if there are n friends, then for x toasts, each friend makes x toasts, so the total drink required is n * x * nl, the total lime slices required is n * x, and the total salt required is n * x * np.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   - The drink limits the toasts to at most (k * l) // (n * nl) because each toast for one friend uses nl, and there are n friends making x toasts each: total drink = n * x * nl <= k * l -> x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if there are n friends and each makes x toasts, then total drink needed is n * x * nl.\n\n Similarly, total lime slices needed is n * x (each toast requires one slice per friend, and there are n friends each having x slices).\n And total salt needed is n * x * np.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire group's toast-making is independent. Actually, the toasts are per friend, and they all must make the same number.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   max_toasts_by_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n   max_toasts_by_lime = (c * d) // n   # because we need n * x slices, so x <= (c*d) / n\n   max_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np)   # because we need n * x * np grams of salt, so x <= p / (n * np)\n\n Then the limiting factor is the minimum of these three.\n\n However, wait: the example input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n Calculate:\n   Drink: total = 4*5 = 20 ml.\n   For 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml. So for x toasts per friend, total drink = 3 * x * 3 = 9x ml. Then 9x <= 20 -> x <= 20/9 ~ 2.22 -> floor to 2.\n\n   Lime: total slices = 10*8 = 80. For 3 friends, each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so for x toasts per friend, total slices = 3*x. 3*x <= 80 -> x <= 80/3 ~ 26.66 -> 26.\n\n   Salt: total salt = 100 grams. Each toast per friend requires 1 gram, so total salt = 3*x*1 = 3x. 3x <= 100 -> x <= 100/3 ~ 33.33 -> 33.\n\n Then the answer is min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n So the calculation for drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n But wait, is that correct? Actually, the total drink is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three constraints: the total drink available, the total lime slices available, and the total salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves computing the maximum number of toasts possible for each resource separately and then taking the minimum of these values. This ensures that no resource is exhausted before others, allowing all friends to have the same number of toasts.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm calculates:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink divided by the product of the number of friends, drink per toast, and the number of friends.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices divided by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt divided by the product of the number of friends, salt per toast, and the number of friends.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    max_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    max_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(max_toasts_by_drink, max_toasts_by_lime, max_toasts_by_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: The total available drink is computed as `k * l`. The total lime slices are `c * d`.\n3. **Toast Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: The maximum toasts based on drink availability is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`, ensuring enough drink for all friends.\n   - **Lime Limit**: The maximum toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`, ensuring enough slices for all friends.\n   - **Salt Limit**: The maximum toasts based on salt availability is `p // (n * np)`, ensuring enough salt for all friends.\n4. **Result Determination**: The smallest value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource limit.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
