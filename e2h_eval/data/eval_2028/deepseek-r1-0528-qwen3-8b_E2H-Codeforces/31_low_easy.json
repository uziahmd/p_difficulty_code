Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of cards (from the infinite set) that have integers between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n We need to find the minimum number of additional cards (each with an integer in [-x, x]) such that the overall sum is 0.\n\n Note: We can choose any card from the set of integers from -x to x arbitrarily many times.\n\n Let k be the number of additional cards. Then we need to represent (k_min) such that there exist integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k_min} in [-x, x] for which:\n   S + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k_min} = 0\n\n This is equivalent to:\n   a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k_min} = -S\n\n We want the smallest k_min.\n\n Observation:\n Each additional card can contribute a value in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the total sum we can achieve with k_min cards must lie in the interval [-k_min*x, k_min*x].\n\n Also, note that we can adjust the total by at least 1 (since we can use consecutive integers). However, the minimal k_min must satisfy:\n\n Condition 1: | -S | <= k_min * x   (because the total sum must be at least -k_min*x and at most k_min*x)\n\n But also, we cannot just use k_min=ceil(|S|/x) because sometimes we might not be able to get exactly the sum -S if we don't have the right granularity?\n\n Actually, we can think greedily: we can achieve any integer value in the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x] as long as k_min is sufficiently large? Not exactly: the step is 1, but the entire set of integers from -x to x is available. However, note that we can use multiple cards. The key is:\n\n With k_min cards, the set of achievable sums is all integers T such that:\n   -k_min*x <= T <= k_min*x, and T ≡ (k_min mod 2) ? Actually, no: the set of achievable sums is symmetric and contiguous. \n\n Actually, the minimal absolute value we can achieve with one card is 0, but wait: we have negative and positive. However, note that the parity doesn't matter because we can use both positive and negative.\n\n But note: we can achieve any integer T in the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x] provided that k_min is sufficiently large? Actually, with k_min=1, we can only get values from -x to x. With k_min=2, we can get from -2x to 2x, and every integer in between? Yes, because we can use two cards: for example, to get 0: (0,0) or (1,-1) etc. But wait, the set of numbers is from -x to x, so the two-card sum can be as low as -2x and as high as 2x, and since we can choose any two integers from [-x,x], the set of two-card sums is every integer between -2x and 2x.\n\n Similarly, with k_min cards, we can get every integer T such that |T| <= k_min*x.\n\n However, note: we can also get non-negative and negative numbers arbitrarily by using positive and negative cards.\n\n Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the absolute value of the required sum (-S) must be <= k_min*x.\n\n But wait: what if we require a very specific sum? For example, if x=2 and we require a total of 3 with two cards? Then the maximum we can get is 4 (2+2), but can we get 3? Yes: 2+1. So indeed, we can get every integer in the range.\n\n However, let's consider: with k_min=2 and x=2, the set of achievable sums is from -4 to 4. But is every integer in that range achievable?\n   -4: (-2,-2)\n   -3: (-2,-1)\n   -2: (-2,0) or (-1,-1)\n   -1: (-1,0)\n    0: (0,0) or (1,-1)\n    1: (1,0)\n    2: (2,0) or (1,1)\n    3: (2,1)\n    4: (2,2)\n\n So yes, every integer from -4 to 4 is achievable.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: find the smallest k_min (nonnegative integer) such that:\n   k_min * x >= abs(S)\n\n However, note: we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum using cards with integers between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to make the total sum of all cards zero by adding the fewest possible cards. Each card can have any integer from -x to x. The key observation is that the sum of k cards must lie within the range [-k*x, k*x]. Therefore, the absolute value of the deficit (the negative of the current sum) must be less than or equal to k*x.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer k such that k*x is at least the absolute value of the current sum. This is derived from the fact that each card can contribute a maximum absolute value of x towards balancing the sum.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the current sum of the found cards.\n   - Determining the smallest k where k*x >= abs(current_sum). This k is computed by taking the ceiling of the division of the absolute sum by x. However, if the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of found cards, as it only requires a single pass through the list of cards to compute their sum. The space complexity is O(1) since we only store the sum and other variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    abs_total = abs(total)\n    k_min = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n    \n    print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards (n), the maximum absolute value allowed on any card (x), and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Finding Minimum Cards**: The absolute value of the sum is calculated. The minimum number of cards required (k_min) is determined by dividing the absolute sum by x and rounding up. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the smallest number of cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic and ensures optimal performance with linear time complexity.",
