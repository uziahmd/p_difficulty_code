Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (and no extra). \n So, if the total length of the two names is not equal to the length of the pile, then it's \"NO\". But wait: the problem says there shouldn't be any extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Let s1 = first line, s2 = second line, s3 = third line.\n - Form a string s = s1 + s2.\n - Check if the length of s equals the length of s3.\n   - If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n - Otherwise, sort the entire string s and sort the entire string s3.\n - If the sorted s and sorted s3 are the same, then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", so s = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then we check if len(s) == len(s3): \n        len(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") = 14 + 8 = 22\n        len(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") = 22 -> same.\n\n   Then sort s and sort s3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use collections.Counter to count the frequency of each letter.\n\n Since the strings are short (<=100), sorting or counting is efficient.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings in an example, but the actual input is three lines.\n\n Example input format:\n\n SANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n However, the example also has other cases.\n\n But wait, the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n Actually, that is just the example input as a list of three strings? But the problem says three lines.\n\n So, we read three lines.\n\n However, note that the example input is given as a list of three strings, but actually the sample input would be:\n\n Input:\n SANTACLAUS\n DEDMOROZ\n SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n But in the example, the input is provided as a list of three strings, but the second sample is:\n\n Input:\n PAPAINOEL\n JOULUPUKKI\n JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n And the third sample is:\n\n Input:\n BABBONATALE\n FATHERCHRISTMAS\n BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n However, the example output is ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n Let me test with the first example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, let's break down:\n\n   Guest: S A N T A C L A U S -> 10 letters\n   Host: D E D M O R O Z -> 8 letters\n   Total: 18 letters? Wait, wait, wait: \n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of three strings? Actually, the example input is provided as a single string with three elements?\n\n   Let me clarify: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we read three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is written as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   This is confusing. Actually, the example input is three separate lines.\n\n   Let me compute the lengths:\n\n   First line: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10\n   Second line: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8\n   Third line: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 15? \n\n   But wait, the example says: In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\n   How many letters do we need? 10 + 8 = 18. But the third string has 15 letters? That doesn't add up.\n\n   Let me check: \n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n        Total: 18 letters.\n\n        Third string: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count: \n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 16? \n\n        Actually, let me write it out: \n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> wait, that's 18 letters.\n\n        I must have miscounted. Let me count again:\n\n        S A N T A M O R O Z -> 10\n        D E D C L A U S -> 8\n\n        So the string is 18 letters.\n\n   So, we are safe to compare by length and then by sorted order.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read the three lines.\n\n   s1 = first_line.strip()\n   s2 = second_line.strip()\n   s3 = third_line.strip()\n\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n\n   if len(total_letters) != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n Let me test with the first example:\n\n   total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (without spaces, because we strip)\n\n   But wait, the example input may have newlines. We are stripping, so that's okay.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        total_letters = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let's compute the length: \n            \"PAPAINOEL\" -> 8, \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> 10 -> total 18\n        s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> let's count: \n            J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I -> \n            Actually, let's count: \n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 19 letters.\n\n        So length is 19 vs 18 -> NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        total_letters = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> \n            BABBONATALE: 11, FATHERCHRISTMAS: 15 -> total 26\n        s3: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER: \n            BAB:3, CHRISTMAS:9, BONATALLE:8, FATHER:6 -> but wait, let's count the whole string.\n\n        Actually, let me count: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R -> 27 letters.\n\n        So 26 vs 27 -> NO.\n\n   Therefore, the example outputs are: YES, NO, NO.\n\n   But wait, the example output is given as ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n   However, note the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   But the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   Actually, this is a list of three strings, each string containing the three lines concatenated with '\\n'? \n\n   No, wait, the problem says: \n        The input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So, in the example, the input file would have:\n\n        Line1: SANTACLAUS\n        Line2: DEDMOROZ\n        Line3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   But the example representation is a list of three strings, each string being one of the inscriptions? \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This seems to be a representation of the input as a list of three strings, but each string contains two lines? \n\n   Let me read the problem again: \n        The input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So, we are reading three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings, and each string is one of the inputs? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        Input: \n            The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\n   Therefore, we read three lines.\n\n   But the example input representation is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing. Actually, the example input representation might be showing the entire input as a string? \n\n   However, looking at the example output: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n   It's more likely that the example input is three separate lines, so we read three lines.\n\n   Let me adjust: we are reading three lines from stdin.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n   Then combine the first two and compare to the third.\n\n   But wait, what if the input is provided as one string per line? Then we read three lines.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input:\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then:\n\n        line1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        line2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        line3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then we proceed.\n\n   But the example input representation in the problem is shown as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   This is just how the example is represented, meaning that the entire input is given as three separate lines.\n\n   So, the code:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        total = s1 + s2\n\n        if len(total) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(total) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        total = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        len(total)= 10+8=18, len(s3)=18 -> yes.\n\n        Now, sort total and sort s3.\n\n        total_sorted = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        s3_sorted = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n        They should be the same.\n\n   Example 2: \n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        total = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\", length=8+10=18\n        s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", length=19 -> NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n        total length=11+15=26, s3 length=27 -> NO.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input file has three lines. So we assume that.\n\n   But wait, what if the input has trailing spaces? We are using strip(), which removes leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n   According to the problem: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So no spaces? \n\n   But the problem says \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\", so no spaces. But the input might have newline characters? \n\n   We are reading with input().strip() so we remove the newline. But the example input does not have spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we could read without strip, because the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. \n\n   However, the problem says \"The length of each line does not exceed 100\", so we can safely use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline) if present.\n\n   But the problem says the letters are uppercase and no other characters, so we can also do:\n\n        s1 = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        s2 = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        s3 = input().replace('\\n', '')\n\n   However, the built-in input() function in Python by default strips the trailing newline. \n\n   But to be safe, we can use:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n   This will work.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation in the problem is given as a list of three strings, but we are reading three lines. \n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   We'll write the code as described.\n\n   One more edge: if the two names are empty? The problem says each line is not empty, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        total_length = len(s1) + len(s2)\n        if total_length != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # Sort both and compare\n            if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with the example 1.\n\n   Example 1: \n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        sorted(s1+s2) = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        sorted(s3) = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n        We can verify by printing the sorted lists, but we know they should be the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a Counter to make sure we don't have performance issues (though the strings are short).\n\n   Another method: use a frequency dictionary.\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the length check is already done, so we can skip the length check and rely on the counter.\n\n   However, the problem says the pile should have the exact same letters (same multiset). \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is also efficient for small strings.\n\n   Which one to choose? Both are O(n log n) for sorting (if we do sorted) and O(n) for the counter? Actually, the counter also has to iterate and count, and the comparison for counters is O(n) as well.\n\n   But the strings are very short (<=100), so either is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says the length of each line <=100, so the total length is at most 200, which is small.\n\n   We can use either. \n\n   Let me use the Counter method because it is straightforward and we don't have to worry about the length separately.\n\n   But wait: what if the total length is different? Then the Counter will automatically fail because the counts for some letter might be off. However, the Counter method does not require a prior length check, but it is still efficient.\n\n   However, the problem requires that there are no extra letters and no missing letters. So if the length is different, then the Counters will be different.\n\n   Example: \n        s1+s2 = \"ABC\", s3 = \"ABCD\" -> Counter(\"ABC\") is {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1} and Counter(\"ABCD\") is {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1, 'D':1} -> not equal.\n\n   So we don't need an explicit length check.\n\n   But note: the problem says the pile must have exactly the letters (and nothing more). \n\n   Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This covers both conditions: same set and same frequency.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the order, so this is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the names are long? The Counter is efficient for small strings.\n\n   Since the maximum length of s3 is 200 (because two lines of 100 each) and the alphabet is 26, the Counter is efficient.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Counter(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") and Counter(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") should be the same.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Counter(\"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\") and Counter(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\") are different because the total length is 18 vs 19, and even if the length were the same, the counts would differ.\n\n   Example 3: similarly.\n\n   So, we can use the Counter method.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is from stdin. \n\n   We'll import Counter and use it.\n\n   But the problem says the input is three lines. We are reading three lines.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, the problem says the third line is the pile. \n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   Let me run the first example:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        s1+s2 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Counter for that and for s3 should be the same.\n\n   However, I can manually check:\n\n        s1+s2: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        s3: \n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Same.\n\n   Example 2: \n        s1+s2: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n            P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        Different: P is 2 vs 1, and L is 2 vs 1, and also A is 2 vs 2, but wait:\n\n        Let me count:\n\n        s1+s2: \n            P: appears in \"PAPAINOEL\": 2 times (first and second letter) and then in \"JOULUPUKKI\": no P -> so P:2\n            s3: \n            \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\": \n                P appears once (in the substring \"NAPO\" -> the 'P' in \"PA\")? Actually, look: \n                J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n                P: at index 6 (0-indexed) and index 15 -> so two P's? \n\n        Wait, let me count again for s3:\n\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n            J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n            So P: at index6 and index14 (if we consider the string without space) -> two P's.\n\n        Then why did I say above that s3 has one P? I was wrong.\n\n        Actually, the example 2: \n            s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            Let me break down:\n                J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\n            Now, let me count each letter:\n\n            J:1, O:3, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            Now, s1+s2: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n            Break down:\n                P:2 (from \"PA\" and \"PA\" in the beginning? Actually, \"PAPA\" -> so P:2, A:2, then ...)\n\n            Actually, let me count s1+s2:\n\n                PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\n\n                P:2 (from \"PAPA\")\n                A:4? because \"PAPAINOEL\" -> P,A,P,A,I,N,O,E,L -> so A:2 from \"PAPAINOEL\", then \"JOULUPUKKI\": J,O,U,L,U,P,U,K,K,I -> A:0, so total A:2?\n                Wait, let me list:\n\n                PAPAINOEL: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L -> A:2, P:2\n                JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> A:0, P:1\n\n                So total A:2, P:3\n\n            Now, wait, that changes everything.\n\n            Correction for s1+s2:\n\n                s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\": \n                    P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n                s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\":\n                    J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1\n\n                So combined:\n                    P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n            Now, s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n                J:1, O:3, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            Now, comparing:\n\n                P: s1+s2 has 3, s3 has 2 -> so they are not equal.\n\n            Therefore, the example 2 is indeed NO.\n\n            But wait, the example output is NO, so our program returns NO.\n\n            However, the example provided in the problem says:\n\n                ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n            And the output is ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n            So the second example is correctly identified.\n\n            But the above manual count for example2 showed that the Counter method would catch the discrepancy.\n\n            Therefore, the code using Counter is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation might have been given with the entire string for the pile, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   We are reading three lines.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the input is large? The problem says the length is at most 100 per line, so total 200, which is small.\n\n   However, if we want to avoid importing, we can use the sorted method.\n\n   Since the problem is very hard (according to the note) and we are allowed to use standard libraries, Counter is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem says \"Note: this is a very hard question\", but the solution is straightforward. \n\n   Alternatively, without Counter, we can do:\n\n        if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n\n   This is also straightforward and we don't need to import.\n\n   Considering that the problem does not require avoiding imports, but sometimes competitive programming problems prefer no imports, we can do either.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify, so I'll use the sorted method to avoid importing.\n\n   But wait, the sorted method requires that the two strings are of the same length, which we already know from the Counter method, but the sorted method inherently doesn't care because if the lengths are different, then the sorted lists will have different lengths and the comparison fails.\n\n   However, if we use sorted, we don't have to check the length because if the lengths are different, then sorted(s1+s2) and sorted(s3) will be of different lengths and the comparison will be False.\n\n   Example: \n        s1+s2 has length 18, s3 has length 19 -> [a list of 18] != [a list of 19] -> True, so it will return False.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if len(s1+s2) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Or without the length check:\n\n        if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But the sorted method without length check: if the lengths are different, then the sorted lists are of different lengths and the condition fails.\n\n   So we can do without the length check.\n\n   However, the problem says the third line is the pile, and we are to check that the pile has exactly the letters. \n\n   The sorted method will work.\n\n   But note: the sorted method is O(n log n) and the Counter method is O(n) in terms of time (but with constant factors). For n=200, it doesn't matter.\n\n   We'll choose the sorted method because it is simple and we don't need to import.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: YES.\n   Example 2: NO.\n   Example 3: NO.\n\n   But wait, example 3: \n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        The length of s1+s2 is 11+15=26, s3 is 27 -> so sorted(s1+s2) and sorted(s3) are of different lengths -> NO.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, the example input representation for example3 in the problem is:\n\n        ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But note: the example input is three lines. The example representation is a list of three strings, but the actual input is three lines.\n\n   We are reading three lines. \n\n   But wait, the example input representation might be including the newline as part of the string? \n\n   Actually, when we use input().strip(), we remove the newline. \n\n   But the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So there should be no newline in the middle.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined names of the guest and the host. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the total number of letters in the combined names must match the number of letters in the pile, and the frequency of each letter in the combined names must exactly match the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** If the length of the combined names does not match the length of the pile, immediately output \"NO\" since it's impossible to form the names from the pile.\n4. **Check Letter Frequencies:** If the lengths match, sort both the combined names and the pile. If the sorted strings are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, so output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns1 = input().strip()\ns2 = input().strip()\ns3 = input().strip()\n\nif sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace (though the problem guarantees uppercase letters only).\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Length Check:** Although the sorted check inherently handles different lengths by comparing the entire sorted lists, the solution first ensures that the combined names and the pile have the same length implicitly during the sorted comparison.\n4. **Frequency Check:** By sorting both the combined names and the pile, the code checks if they are permutations of each other. If the sorted strings match, it confirms that the pile contains exactly the required letters, allowing the names to be reconstructed; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the solution by leveraging sorting to compare the multiset of letters in both strings, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead for the given constraints.",
