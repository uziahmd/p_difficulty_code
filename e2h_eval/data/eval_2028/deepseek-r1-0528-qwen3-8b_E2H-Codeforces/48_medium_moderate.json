He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one string which is either an integer or 'R' (for Roman). But note: the second part may be an integer OR the letter 'R'. However, the input format says: the first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25) but then says \"Only b may be replaced by an R\". So actually, the first token is always an integer a (base), and the second token can be either an integer b (the base) or the letter 'R' (meaning Roman numerals).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split into two parts.\n 2. The first part is the base a (integer). The second part is either an integer (if not 'R') or the string 'R'.\n 3. Then read the next line which is the number c in base a.\n\n We have two cases:\n   Case 1: Second token is an integer (say base_b). Then we need to convert the number from base a to base b.\n   Case 2: Second token is 'R'. Then we need to convert the number from base a to a decimal (base 10) first, and then convert that decimal number to a Roman numeral.\n\n Important: The input number c is given in base a. The base a can be from 2 to 25. The representation of c may contain digits from '0' to the digit representing (a-1). Since base a can be up to 25, we might have digits beyond 9, so we use letters? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" and the example has base 12 and uses 'A'.\n\n However, note that the example input includes: \n   \"12 13\\nA\" -> output 'A'\n\n But wait: the example input has two examples with base conversion and one with Roman. The example input list:\n\n Example 1: \"10 2\\n1\" -> output '1'\n Example 2: \"16 R\\n5\" -> output 'V' (because 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal, then convert 5 to Roman is 'V')\n Example 3: \"5 R\\n4\" -> output 'IV' (because 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal, then convert 4 to Roman is 'IV')\n Example 4: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> output '1111001' (same base, no change)\n Example 5: \"12 13\\nA\" -> output 'A'\n\n But note: the example input \"12 13\\nA\": \n   Here, the first token is 12 (base), the second token is 13 (base), and the number is \"A\" in base 12. \n   Since base 12: A represents 10. Then we convert 10 from base 12 to base 13. How?\n   But wait, the problem says: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n   However, the example output is 'A'. That implies that the conversion from base 12 to base 13 of the number represented by \"A\" (which is 10) is the digit for 10 in base 13? And in base 13, the digits go from 0 to 12, so 10 would be represented as 'A' (if we use the same letter mapping as base 12, but note: base 13 requires 13 symbols: 0-9 and then A=10, B=11, C=12). So yes, 10 in base 13 is represented as 'A'.\n\n However, let's check: \n   Input: \"12 13\\nA\"\n   Step 1: Convert \"A\" from base 12 to base 10: \n        A in base 12 is 10 (decimal).\n   Step 2: Convert 10 (decimal) to base 13: \n        We divide 10 by 13: quotient 0, remainder 10 -> so the digit is 'A' (since 10 maps to 'A').\n\n But wait, how do we represent base 13? The digits are 0-9, then A, B, C (so 10,11,12). \n\n However, note: the problem says that the input number c is given in base a (which is 12). Then we must convert that to base b (which is 13). \n\n So, the general plan:\n\n If the second token is an integer (call it base_b, which is between 2 and 25) then:\n   Step 1: Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n   Step 2: Convert that decimal integer to base base_b.\n\n But note: the input string c might have leading zeros, and its length doesn't exceed 10^3, so we can convert it from base a to decimal.\n\n However, there is a catch: base a can be up to 25, and the number c is non-negative. Also, the decimal value might be very large (like up to 10^1510 in some cases, but the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"). Wait, that's huge! But note: the base a is at least 2, so the maximum value for a string of length n is (a^n - 1). However, the problem says that if it's Roman, the number is <= 300010 and not 0. For non-Roman, the number can be as large as 10^1510, meaning we cannot convert by standard base conversion if we try to compute the entire decimal value because the number is too big.\n\n Alternative approach for non-Roman conversion:\n\n We cannot convert the entire string to a decimal integer if the number is too big (like 10^1510). Therefore, we must convert the string from base a to base b without going through the huge decimal number? \n\n But note: base a is at most 25, and base b is at most 25. We can do the conversion in base b by repeatedly converting the base a digits to base b, but we have to avoid the huge decimal number.\n\n Alternatively, we can convert the base a string to base b by processing the string from left to right and doing the conversion in base b.\n\n Steps for non-Roman:\n\n   We want to convert a number in base a to base b (both between 2 and 25) without converting to base 10 (to avoid the huge number).\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Let n = 0 (this will be the result in base b, but we don't know how many digits, and we cannot store the whole number in base 10 if it's too big)\n\n   However, note that the problem says that the number in non-Roman case can be up to 10^1510, which is a number with about 1510 digits in base 10. But our bases are small (from 2 to 25). We cannot store such a big number in base 10, but we can store it in base b by processing digit by digit.\n\n   We can use the following method:\n\n   We'll convert the base a string to base b by:\n\n   Step 1: Convert each digit of the base a string to an integer (each digit is from '0' to the digit representing a-1). Since a<=25, we can map each character to a digit.\n\n   Step 2: We can use a method similar to base conversion but without going through base 10. However, base conversion typically goes through base 10. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   We can use the fact that we are converting from base a to base b. We can use repeated division by b, but the intermediate number is too big to represent as an integer.\n\n   Another idea: process the base a string as a number in base a and then convert to base b by simulating the conversion without storing the entire number.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   Let the input string s (of length L) in base a.\n\n   We can interpret the string as:\n\n      num = d0 * (a^(L-1)) + d1 * (a^(L-2)) + ... + d_{L-1} * (a^0)\n\n   Then we want to express this in base b.\n\n   But the exponents and the digits are too big.\n\n   However, note that the problem constraints say that the length of the string is at most 1000. But the base a is at most 25, so the number can be as big as 25^1000, which is astronomically huge and cannot be stored as an integer.\n\n   We need an alternative: convert the base a string to base b by processing each digit and using a list of digits in base b, but we cannot calculate the entire number.\n\n   We can use the method of converting from base a to base b by repeated multiplication and addition, but in base b.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let x = 0 (this will be the number in base b, but we are building the digits in base b from least significant to most)\n\n   For each digit d in the base a string (from left to right):\n\n      x = x * a + d\n\n      Then, while x >= b:\n          x = x // b   (but we cannot store x as an integer because it might be too big)\n\n   This method doesn't work because we cannot store the entire x.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: convert the base a string to base 10 using arbitrary precision integers? But the number can be as large as 25^1000, which is way beyond what Python can handle (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but 25^1000 is a number with about 1000*log10(25) ~ 1000*1.4 = 1400 digits, which is acceptable in terms of storage? Actually, 25^1000 is about 10^1400, which is a number with 1400 digits. Python can handle that, but the problem says the number can be up to 10^1510, which is even bigger? Actually, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, which is also acceptable in Python because of arbitrary precision. But wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning the base a representation might be a string of up to 1000 digits, but the value is at most 10^1510. \n\n   However, note: the base a is at least 2. The maximum value for a string of n digits in base a is (a^n - 1). The problem says that the number (the value) is at most 10^1510 in non-Roman cases. So we can convert the base a string to a base 10 integer, because the base 10 integer will have at most 1511 digits, which is manageable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning the decimal value is <= 10^1510. So we can convert the base a string to a base 10 integer and then convert that base 10 integer to base b.\n\n   Steps for non-Roman:\n\n     Step 1: Convert the base a string to a base 10 integer. But note: the base a string might have digits from '0' to the digit representing (a-1). Since a<=25, we can map each character to a digit.\n\n        We'll map:\n          '0' to 0, '1' to 1, ... '9' to 9, then 'A' to 10, 'B' to 11, ... up to the (a-1)-th digit.\n\n        But note: the input string may contain digits that are valid in base a. Since base a is at most 25, the digits can be from '0' to 'Z' (but only up to 25 distinct digits). We can create a mapping from char to int.\n\n        Example: base 12: digits are 0-9 and A (for 10 and 11). But the input string for base 12 could be \"B\", which is 11.\n\n     Step 2: Now we have a base 10 integer n (which is at most 10^1510, so a string of up to 1511 digits). Then convert this base 10 integer to base b (which is between 2 and 25).\n\n        We can do the standard conversion: repeatedly divide by b and record remainders.\n\n        But note: the base 10 integer n might be 0? The problem says: the number is non-negative. However, the input string might be \"0\" (with leading zeros). But note: the problem says \"omit leading zeros\", so if the result is 0, we output \"0\".\n\n        However, the problem also says: in the Roman case, the number is guaranteed not to be 0 and <= 300010. In non-Roman, the number is non-negative and <= 10^1510.\n\n        But note: the input string might be \"0\", then in non-Roman we output \"0\", but in Roman we are guaranteed it's not 0.\n\n     However, there's a caveat: the input string may have leading zeros. Our conversion from base a to base 10 must ignore leading zeros? Actually, the conversion algorithm naturally ignores leading zeros.\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 2 and the string is \"00\"? Then the base10 value is 0.\n\n   So, the plan for non-Roman:\n\n        Step 1: Map the string to a base10 integer.\n\n        How to convert base a string to base10:\n\n            n = 0\n            for each char in the string:\n                d = mapping[char]   # mapping from char to digit value\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        But wait, the input string might be very long (up to 1000 characters) and the base a is at most 25. The maximum value is 10^1510, so the base10 integer n will be a very big integer, but Python can handle that.\n\n        Step 2: Convert base10 integer n to base b.\n\n            If n == 0, then output \"0\"\n\n            Otherwise, we do:\n\n                digits = []\n                while n:\n                    r = n % b\n                    digits.append(r)\n                    n = n // b\n\n                Then reverse digits and map each digit to the corresponding character (for base b, the digits go from 0 to b-1, so we map 0-9 to '0'-'9', and 10 to 'A', 11 to 'B', etc.)\n\n            However, note: the problem does not require leading zeros, so we output the digits from last division to first, without leading zeros.\n\n   But wait: what if the base b is 1? The problem states that b is at least 2.\n\n   However, there's a problem: the input string might be very long (1000 digits) and base a is 2, then the base10 integer n is 2^1000, which is about 10^300, which is acceptable in Python. But the problem says the non-Roman number is at most 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the non-Roman number is at most 10^1510. However, the base a is at most 25, and the length is at most 1000, so the maximum value is 25^1000, which is about (25^1000) = (10^log10(25))^1000 = (10^1.39794)^1000 ~ 10^(1397.94) which is a number with about 1400 digits. 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, so our number might be up to 25^1000 (about 10^1400) which is less than 10^1510. So the constraint 10^1510 is an upper bound that covers our maximum.\n\n   However, the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning the decimal value is <= 10^1510. So our base10 integer n is <= 10^1510.\n\n   But 10^1510 is a very big number, but Python can handle integers up to around 10^300000 or more (in terms of digits). However, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, so it's acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the input string length is at most 1000, and base a is 25, so the maximum value is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510. So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the number (the decimal value) is at most 10^1510. So we are guaranteed that the base10 integer n is <= 10^1510, which is a 1511-digit number. This is acceptable for Python.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input string length doesn't exceed 10^3, so 1000. The base a is from 2 to 25, so the maximum value is 25^1000. But 25^1000 is about 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510, so the condition holds.\n\n   However, what if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 ones? Then the value is (2^1000 - 1) which is about 10^300, which is acceptable. But the problem says the non-Roman number is at most 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", so we are allowed to assume that the base10 integer is at most 10^1510, which is a 1511-digit number. We can convert such a big integer from base a to base b by first converting to base10 and then base b.\n\n   However, if we do the base10 conversion, we are storing an integer with up to 1511 digits. Then we convert that to base b. The base b conversion will run in O(digits) where digits is the number of base10 digits (about 1511) and then we do 1511 divisions by base b (at most 25). This is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the input string might be up to 1000 digits, and base a is 25, then the base10 integer has about 1400 digits. Then we do 1400 divisions by base b (which is at most 25). That's acceptable.\n\n   However, there's an alternative: we can convert the base a string to base b without going through base10, by processing the string and building the base b representation from the least significant digit, but avoiding the huge base10 integer. But the problem says that the base10 integer is at most 10^1510, so we can rely on base10 conversion.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3\". The length is at most 1000. So we can do:\n\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            n = n * a + digit_value(char)\n\n        Then convert n to base b.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that in non-Roman case the number is at most 10^1510. However, if the base a is 10 and the string is 1000 digits, then the number is 10^1000, which is less than 10^1510. So we are safe.\n\n   However, the problem says the base a is from 2 to 25, so the base10 integer n is at most 25^1000 (about 10^1400) which is less than 10^1510.\n\n   Therefore, we can safely convert to base10.\n\n   But note: the problem says the non-Roman case the number is non-negative and <= 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   However, let me re-read: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". So we are guaranteed that the decimal value is <= 10^1510.\n\n   Now, the Roman case:\n\n        We are given base a and then 'R'. Then the input string c (in base a) must be converted to a base10 integer (and the problem guarantees that the decimal value is at most 300010 and not 0).\n\n        Then, we convert that base10 integer (which is between 1 and 300010) to a Roman numeral.\n\n   Steps for Roman:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the base a string to base10 integer (same as above).\n\n        Step 2: Convert the base10 integer (let's call it n, which is between 1 and 300010) to a Roman numeral.\n\n   How to convert an integer to Roman numeral?\n\n        We can use a mapping of integer values to Roman numeral symbols, and then use a greedy algorithm.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals:\n\n        M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, \n        L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the subtractive principle is used: IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.\n\n        We can define a list of tuples:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, \"M\"),\n                (900, \"CM\"),\n                (500, \"D\"),\n                (400, \"CD\"),\n                (100, \"C\"),\n                (90, \"XC\"),\n                (50, \"L\"),\n                (40, \"XL\"),\n                (10, \"X\"),\n                (9, \"IX\"),\n                (5, \"V\"),\n                (4, \"IV\"),\n                (1, \"I\")\n            ]\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            def to_roman(n):\n                res = ''\n                for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                    while n >= value:\n                        res += symbol\n                        n -= value\n                return res\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the number is at most 300010. Our mapping goes up to 1000 (M). We need to represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n        But standard Roman numerals do not have a standard representation for numbers beyond 3999. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we have to extend the mapping.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify beyond the standard subtractive principles, but note that the example does not go beyond 9.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        And for numbers beyond 4000, we don't have a defined symbol. But the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we need to represent up to 300010.\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same method as above but extend the mapping to include:\n\n            For 5000: we don't have a symbol. But wait, 300010 is 300,010. \n\n        Actually, the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300,010. We can break it down as:\n\n            Break the number into groups by thousands? But 300010 is 300 thousands and 10.\n\n        However, the standard way to represent numbers beyond 3999 is not defined in the problem. But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3000 and then use a bar notation or something? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Let me check the example: the example only goes up to 5.\n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we must represent numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            We know that 300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10.\n\n        But we don't have a symbol for 10000? The problem does not specify.\n\n        However, looking at the problem statement: \"Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five\"\n\n        This implies that the system is extended by repetition. But they also said the subtractive principle for 4 and 9.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not define beyond 3999. But note: the example input \"5 R\\n4\" and \"16 R\\n5\" are small.\n\n        But the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we must design a way to represent 300010.\n\n        We can use a simple method: represent the number by breaking it into thousands, then each thousand is represented by a series of 'M's? But 300010 is 300 thousands and 10. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the standard additive and subtractive principles and extend the symbols:\n\n            For 1000: M\n            For 2000: MM\n            ...\n            For 9000: MMMCM? Actually, 9000 is CM (for 1000s) but we don't have a symbol for 10000.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the example does not require such large numbers, we can assume that the test cases for Roman numerals are within the standard range (up to 3999). But the problem says up to 300010.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n        We must represent up to 300010.\n\n        We can use the following: since 300010 is 300000 + 10, and 300000 is 300 * 1000, we can represent 1000 as M, 2000 as MM, 3000 as MMM, then 4000 as MMMM? But wait, the subtractive principle is used for 4 and 9, but for thousands we don't have a standard subtractive representation. However, 4000 would be written as MMMM, and 9000 as MMMMMMMMM? That's 9 Ms.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same subtractive principle for thousands: 4000 would be written as XM? But wait, the problem says the base placed before the higher base. The higher base for 1000 is 10000? But we don't have a symbol for 10000.\n\n        The problem does not define symbols beyond 1000. Therefore, we must assume that the representation is done by repeating the M for thousands.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that was for the base representation. For Roman, we are only given the standard symbols.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small, we can assume that the test cases for Roman numerals are in the range [1, 3999]. But wait, 300010 is greater than 3999.\n\n        We must then extend the system. One way is to use a bar notation or parentheses, but the problem does not specify.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the number into two parts: the part above 3999 and the part below 4000. But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Let me check the example: the example numbers are 5 and 4, which are standard.\n\n        The problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that is for the base representation, not for Roman.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended Roman numeral system for numbers beyond 3999, and the example input does not require it, we must assume that the Roman numeral test cases are only for numbers up to 3999. But the problem says up to 300010.\n\n        This is a contradiction. However, note: the problem says \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\", but also says \"it won't be 0\". \n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: the second part is either an integer b or 'R'. Then the next line contains the number c in base a.\n\n        For the Roman case, the number (the decimal value) is at most 300010. \n\n        How did they get 300010? Maybe they meant the base a representation length is limited, but the decimal value is at most 300010.\n\n        But 300010 is 300010, which is way beyond 3999.\n\n        We must represent 300010.\n\n        The standard Roman numeral system does not have a symbol for 10000, so we have to use a different approach.\n\n        One common way is to use a vinculum (bar) above a numeral to multiply it by 1000, but that is not standard and the problem doesn't mention.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that 300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10, and then represent 300 as CCC, and 1000 as M, but then 300*1000 would be MMM... (300 Ms) and then add 10 as X. But that's 300 Ms and then X.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify such extended representation.\n\n        After reading the problem statement, it says: \"The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty!\" and \"It's now 260 AD\", so they are using Roman numerals as described. \n\n        Given the ambiguity, I think we should assume that the Roman numeral test cases are only for numbers up to 3999, because the problem does not specify how to represent numbers beyond 3999.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010. This is a clear upper bound.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the base a representation is of a number that in decimal is at most 300010, but the base a representation might be shorter for the same decimal value? \n\n        Actually, the base a representation of a number is independent of the base. The decimal value is fixed.\n\n        Example: base 10 representation of 300010 is \"300010\", base 16 representation of 300010 is \"48C5E\", which is much shorter.\n\n        So the input string for base a (which is 16) would be \"48C5E\", and then we convert that to base10 (which is 300010) and then to Roman.\n\n        But 300010 is beyond 3999.\n\n        How to represent 300010 in Roman? \n\n        Without additional rules, we cannot. But the problem expects an answer.\n\n        I think we must assume that the problem allows the standard Roman numeral system and then for numbers beyond 3999, we break them down by place value, but that is not standard.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the Roman numeral representation is only for numbers up to 3999, and the guarantee that the number is <= 300010 is a mistake? Or the guarantee is that the number is <= 3000 (if we consider standard Roman numerals)? \n\n        But the problem says 300010.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem means that the base a representation of the number (which is in base a) is a string of length at most 1000, and the decimal value is at most 300010. But that is the same as saying the decimal value is at most 300010.\n\n        Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and we are to solve the problem, we must decide on a representation for numbers beyond 3999.\n\n        After some thought, I think we can use the following:\n\n        We break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, but for thousands we use the letter M and then a bar if necessary? But the problem doesn't allow bars.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same additive method and use multiple M's. For example, 4000 is MMMM, 5000 is MMMMM, 9000 is MMMMMMMMM, and so on.\n\n        But 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can represent 300000 as 300 * 1000 = 300 * M = 300 Ms.\n\n        Then 10 is X.\n\n        So the entire number is 300 Ms and then X.\n\n        However, the standard Roman numeral system does not use more than 3 consecutive same letters. But the problem does not specify that. It says: \"Symbols are iterated to produce multiples\", so we can use as many as needed.\n\n        But then 4000 would be MMMM, and 9000 would be MMMMMMMMM (9 Ms). \n\n        Then we can use the same subtractive principle for thousands? For example, 4000 is represented as MMMM, but sometimes it is written as IVMM? No, because we don't have a symbol for 5000.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we'll use the additive method for thousands.\n\n        Steps for converting a number n (from 1 to 300010) to Roman:\n\n            We can break n into:\n\n            thousands = n // 1000\n            remainder = n % 1000\n\n            Then convert thousands to a string of 'M' repeated thousands times.\n\n            Then convert remainder (which is from 0 to 999) to the standard Roman numerals (using the subtractive principle for 1 to 999).\n\n            Then combine.\n\n        But wait, the standard subtractive principle is defined for 1 to 3999, but we are breaking the number into thousands and then the rest. The rest is less than 1000, so we can use the standard mapping for 1 to 999.\n\n        However, what if we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either a standard integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main cases: converting between standard bases and converting from a standard base to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values which include the source base `a`, the target base `b` (which could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number `c` represented in base `a`.\n2. **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the number `c` from base `a` to base 10 first. Then, convert the resulting base 10 number to the target base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base `b` is 'R', first convert the number `c` from base `a` to base 10. Then, convert this base 10 number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols, applying the subtractive principle where necessary (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n4. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the output does not have leading zeros. For Roman numerals, handle numbers up to 300,010 by breaking them down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, converting each part separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    base_b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    mapping_chars_to_int = {}\n    for i in range(36):\n        mapping_chars_to_int.update({str(i): i})\n    letters = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    for i, letter in enumerate(letters):\n        mapping_chars_to_int[letter] = i + 10\n\n    def convert_base_a_to_base10(s, base_a):\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char not in mapping_chars_to_int:\n                return None\n            d = mapping_chars_to_int[char]\n            if d >= base_a:\n                return None\n            n = n * base_a + d\n        return n\n\n    base10_n = convert_base_a_to_base10(num_str, base_a)\n\n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        if base10_n is None:\n            print(\"\")\n        else:\n            if base10_n == 0:\n                print(\"\")\n            else:\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    (1000, \"M\"),\n                    (900, \"CM\"),\n                    (500, \"D\"),\n                    (400, \"CD\"),\n                    (100, \"C\"),\n                    (90, \"XC\"),\n                    (50, \"L\"),\n                    (40, \"XL\"),\n                    (10, \"X\"),\n                    (9, \"IX\"),\n                    (5, \"V\"),\n                    (4, \"IV\"),\n                    (1, \"I\")\n                ]\n                res = []\n                for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                    while base10_n >= value:\n                        base10_n -= value\n                        res.append(symbol)\n                print(''.join(res))\n    else:\n        try:\n            base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        except Exception:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        if base10_n is None:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        if base10_n == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n_val = base10_n\n            while n_val:\n                r = n_val % base_b\n                digits.append(r)\n                n_val = n_val // base_b\n            \n            mapping_digit_to_char = {}\n            for i in range(36):\n                mapping_digit_to_char.update({i: str(i) if i < 10 else chr(ord('A') + i - 10)})\n            \n            res = []\n            for digit in reversed(digits):\n                res.append(mapping_digit_to_char[digit])\n            print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input values and splits them into manageable parts. The first line contains the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which could be an integer or 'R'. The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The number `c` is converted from base `a` to base 10. This involves processing each digit of `c` according to its value in base `a` and accumulating the result.\n3. **Target Base Handling**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, the base 10 number is converted to base `b` by repeatedly dividing by `b` and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (using '0'-'9' and 'A'-'Z' for higher bases).\n   - **Roman Numeral**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs. The conversion uses a greedy approach, subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros. For Roman numerals, the result is a string of Roman symbols representing the original number. For standard base conversions, the result is a string of digits in the target base. \n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
