In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. Each string is of the form \"digit suit\", but note: the input is three separate strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" and each tile is represented by two characters.\n\n Actually, looking at the example input format, it might be that the input line has three space-separated strings? Or three two-character strings separated by spaces?\n\n Let me re-read: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n So, the input line has three strings, each string being two characters? Or each tile is a two-character string and there are three tiles? \n\n Example input: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three strings, but each string is actually containing three tiles? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning the entire hand is given as three strings? Or each tile is given as one string?\n\n Let me clarify: The example input is provided as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But that is just an example. The actual input is one line with three strings (each string representing one tile) OR three tiles in one line?\n\n Wait, the example input has three examples, each on a separate line? But the problem says \"The only line\" for the input.\n\n Actually, the example input is given as three separate lines? Or the problem is showing three examples? \n\n The problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input. However, the example input is written in a list-like fashion. \n\n Clarification: The input is one line with three strings (each string being two characters). Or is it three tiles (so six characters)? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n And each tile is represented by a string of two characters.\n\n Therefore, there are three tiles, so the input line will have three two-character strings. But how are they separated? \n\n The example input is given as: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems to be a representation of three test cases? But the problem says: \"The only line\" for the input. \n\n Actually, looking at the example output: \n   Output: ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So, the problem expects three integers as output? Or one integer per test case? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\n So, the input is one hand of three tiles. Then why are there three examples?\n\n Actually, the example input is provided as three separate examples. In a real competition, there would be multiple test cases? Or is this problem having one test case per run?\n\n The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So, we assume one hand of three tiles, and we output one integer.\n\n However, the example input is shown as three different hands. \n\n Therefore, the example input is three separate inputs (each line is a hand), but the problem states one line.\n\n Since the problem says \"The only line\", we must read one line and split it appropriately.\n\n How to interpret the input?\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1s2s3s\" -> but wait, that would be one string of length 6.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand\" — three tiles. Each tile is two characters. So the whole input string is 6 characters long? \n\n Or are the tiles separated by spaces?\n\n The example input is given as: \n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the first example hand is represented as \"1s 2s 3s\" — which is three two-character strings separated by spaces. \n\n However, the problem says: \"three strings\". So we can split the input line by space to get three strings, each of length 2.\n\n Alternatively, if there",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The goal is to check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. If not, determine the minimal number of tiles to draw to form one.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: \n     - **Triplet**: If all three tiles are identical (same number and suit), then no tiles need to be drawn.\n     - **Sequence**: If the tiles are of the same suit and their numbers form a sequence (like 1,2,3 or 7,8,9), then no tiles are needed.\n   - **Drawing Tiles**:\n     - **One Tile**: If two tiles are identical (forming a partial triplet) or if two tiles can be part of a sequence (missing one tile), then drawing one tile suffices.\n     - **Two Tiles**: If no immediate mentsu can be formed, drawing two tiles might be necessary to complete a triplet or sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Group Tiles by Suit**: Separate tiles into manzu (m), pinzu (p), and souzu (s).\n   - **Check for Triplet**: For each suit, count occurrences of the same number. If any suit has three identical tiles, answer is 0.\n   - **Check for Sequence**: For each suit, sort the numbers and check if they form a sequence (difference of 1 between consecutive numbers). If yes, answer is 0.\n   - **Check for One Tile Draw**: If two tiles are identical, drawing one more of the same completes a triplet. Alternatively, if two tiles can be part of a sequence (e.g., [1,2] missing 3), drawing one tile completes the sequence.\n   - **Check for Two Tiles Draw**: If none of the above conditions are met, drawing two tiles is required to form either a triplet (two identical tiles plus another) or a sequence (two non-identical tiles that can be part of a sequence).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = []\n    for item in data:\n        if len(item) == 2:\n            tiles.append(item)\n        else:\n            # Handle case where input might have extra spaces\n            parts = item.split()\n            if len(parts) == 1 and len(parts[0]) == 2:\n                tiles.append(parts[0])\n            elif len(parts) >= 2:\n                for part in parts:\n                    if len(part) == 2:\n                        tiles.append(part)\n    \n    if len(tiles) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    groups = {suit: [] for suit in suits}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = tile[0]\n        suit_char = tile[1]\n        groups[suit_char].append(int(num))\n    \n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = groups[suit]\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n            \n        if len(set(nums)) == 1 and len(nums) == 3:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n        sorted_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        if len(sorted_nums) == 1:\n            pass\n        elif len(sorted_nums) == 2:\n            if sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1:\n                print(0)\n                return\n        elif len(sorted_nums) == 3:\n            if sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1 and sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[1] == 1:\n                print(0)\n                return\n        else:\n            if max(sorted_nums) - min(sorted_nums) == 2 and len(set(sorted_nums)) == 3:\n                print(0)\n                return\n    \n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = groups[suit]\n        if len(nums) == 0:\n            continue\n        max_num = max(nums) if nums else 0\n        min_num = min(nums) if nums else 0\n        \n        if max_num == min_num:\n            if len(groups[suit]) == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n            else:\n                continue\n                \n        if max_num - min_num == 2:\n            if len(set(nums)) == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n            else:\n                continue\n                \n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = groups[suit]\n        if len(nums) == 0:\n            continue\n        max_num = max(nums) if nums else 0\n        min_num = min(nums) if nums else 0\n        \n        if max_num == min_num and len(groups[suit]) == 1:\n            print(2)\n            return\n            \n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual tile strings. Each tile is expected to be a two-character string (e.g., \"1m\").\n2. **Grouping by Suit**: Tiles are grouped by their suit (m, p, s) to facilitate checking for sequences or triplets within the same suit.\n3. **Triplet Check**: For each suit, if there are three identical tiles, the answer is immediately 0.\n4. **Sequence Check**: For each suit, sorted unique numbers are checked to see if they form a consecutive sequence. If found, the answer is 0.\n5. **One Tile Draw Check**: If two tiles are identical (potential triplet) or two tiles can form a sequence with one additional tile, the answer is 1.\n6. **Two Tiles Draw Check**: If none of the above conditions are met, drawing two tiles is necessary to form a mentsu, hence the answer is 2.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of tiles needed, ensuring optimal performance with constant time complexity for each check due to fixed input size (three tiles).",
