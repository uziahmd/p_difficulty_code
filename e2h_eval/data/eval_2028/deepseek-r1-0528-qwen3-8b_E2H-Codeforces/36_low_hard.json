            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Radio Towers\n\nThere are $$$n + 2$$$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n + 1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000) and we have n+2 towns: 0, 1, ..., n+1.\n We build a tower in each town i (from 1 to n) with probability 1/2, independently.\n\n Conditions for the signal powers:\n   - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n   - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one tower.\n\n Note: The signal from a tower at town i with power p reaches all cities c such that |c-i| < p.\n\n Observation:\n   Let S be the set of towns (from 1 to n) where a tower is built.\n\n   For a town j (from 1 to n) to get exactly one signal, consider that the signal from a tower at i with power p covers [i-p+1, i+p-1] (integer coordinates). Since we require that town 0 and n+1 are not covered, we must have:\n     - For a tower at i, if it is built, then its power p must be chosen so that:\n          i - p + 1 > 0   => p <= i\n          i + p - 1 < n+1  => p <= n+1 - i\n\n   Moreover, the condition that each town j (from 1 to n) is covered by exactly one tower imposes that the entire set of built towers must form a covering of the segment [1, n] without overlapping (except possibly at boundaries, but note the condition |c-i|<p: the coverage is open? Actually, the problem says |c-i| < p, so the coverage of a tower at i with power p is from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, let me re-read:\n\n   Example: n=5, tower at town 2 with power 2: then it covers towns c such that |c-2| < 2 -> c can be 1, 2, 3. So the coverage is the open interval (2-2, 2+2) in integers? Actually, the condition is |c-i| < p, so for integer c, the condition is equivalent to c from floor(i-p+1) to ceil(i+p-1)? But since i, p are integers, then |c-i| < p means c from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Let's check:\n\n      i=2, p=2: then |c-2| < 2 -> c from 1 to 3? Yes, because 2-2 = 0, but wait: the condition is strict inequality. Then c must be greater than 2-2 and less than 2+2, so c in (0,4). The integer c in [1,3] are the ones in (0,4). So the coverage is [1,3] (if we consider integer points).\n\n   However, note the example says: \n        Towns 1,2,3 get the signal from the tower in town 2.\n\n   So the coverage is inclusive of the endpoints? Actually, no: the condition is |c-i| < p, which for integer c and i, and p, is equivalent to c being in the range [i-p+1, i+p-1] (because if c is integer, then |c-i| is an integer and < p means at most p-1). \n\n   But wait: \n        |c-i| < p   =>  -(p) < c-i < p   => i-p < c < i+p.\n\n   Then for integer c, c must satisfy i-p < c < i+p. Since c is integer, the smallest integer greater than i-p is floor(i-p)+1? Actually, the set of integers c satisfying i-p < c < i+p is:\n        c from floor(i-p)+1 to ceil(i+p)-1, but since i and p are integers, then i-p and i+p are integers, so the condition becomes:\n        c from (i-p+1) to (i+p-1) [both inclusive].\n\n   Therefore, the coverage of a tower at i with power p is the contiguous set of integers from (i-p+1) to (i+p-1).\n\n   Now, constraints:\n     1. Town 0 must not be covered: so for every built tower i, we must have i-p+1 > 0, i.e., p <= i.\n        Also, the entire set of built towers must not cover town 0. But note: if there is a tower at i, then even if we set p=i, it would cover from (i-i+1)=1 to (i+i-1)=2*i-1. So town 0 is only covered if there exists a tower",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, we can assign signal powers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The towns are located on a coordinate line from 0 to n+1.\n   - Each town from 1 to n has a tower built with probability 1/2.\n   - The signal from a tower at position i with power p covers all towns c where |c - i| < p, i.e., from i-p+1 to i+p-1.\n   - The constraints require that:\n     - Towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n     - Each town from 1 to n must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For a town j (1 ≤ j ≤ n) to be covered by exactly one tower, the coverage intervals of the towers must be non-overlapping and cover the entire segment [1, n] without including towns 0 or n+1.\n   - The solution involves identifying configurations of built towers where each town in [1, n] can be uniquely assigned a tower's coverage interval.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. The state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to satisfy the conditions for towns up to position i.\n   - The recurrence involves considering whether to include the current town's tower or not, and ensuring the coverage intervals do not overlap and cover the required towns.\n\n4. **Modulo Handling**:\n   - Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we handle large numbers using modular arithmetic, including modular inverses for division operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1 * pow(2, -1, MOD) % MOD)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 2):\n        if i == 1:\n            dp[i] = 1\n        else:\n            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2) % MOD\n            if i >= 2:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n    \n    total_config = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = dp[n + 1] * pow(total_config, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The code reads the input integer `n`, which represents the number of towns from 1 to n.\n   - Special case handling for `n = 1` directly computes the probability as 1/2.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - The `dp` array is initialized to store intermediate results. `dp[0]` is set to 1 as the base case.\n\n3. **DP Array Population**:\n   - For each position `i` from 1 to `n+1`, the code calculates `dp[i]` by considering the previous values. The recurrence relation accounts for including or excluding the current town's tower while ensuring coverage constraints are met.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The total number of possible configurations is `2^n` (each tower built with probability 1/2).\n   - The result is computed by multiplying the valid configurations (`dp[n+1]`) by the modular inverse of the total configurations (`pow(total_config, MOD - 2, MOD)`), giving the probability modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts valid configurations using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, providing the desired probability in optimal time.",
