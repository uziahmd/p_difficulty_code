Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means:\n - '0' can be moved freely to the left (because we can swap 0 and 1, and then 1 and 2? Actually note: \n   However, note that we cannot swap 0 and 2. So the relative order of 0's and 2's is fixed by the presence of 1's.\n\n But note: we can use 1's as intermediaries. For example, to move a '0' past a '2', we have to go through a '1'. \n Similarly, we can move a '1' past a '0' or a '2'. However, we cannot move a '2' past a '0' without a '1' in between.\n\n Actually, think of the operations as two independent adjacent swaps: \n   Operation1: swap '0' and '1'\n   Operation2: swap '1' and '2'\n\n This implies that:\n   - A '0' can only move to the left until it hits a '2' (because if there's a '1' then it can swap with the '1' and keep going, but if there's a '2' then without a '1' in between, we cannot bypass).\n   - Similarly, a '2' can only move to the right until it hits a '0' (if there's no '1' to help? Actually, we can use the 1's to help both 0 and 2 move, but note the constraints: we cannot swap 0 and 2 directly.\n\n Alternate perspective: The problem is similar to having three types, but with restrictions on adjacent swaps.\n\n Observation:\n   Since we can only swap '0' and '1' and '1' and '2', we can consider the following:\n\n   The key is that the relative order of the same digits must remain the same? Actually, no: because we can swap adjacent ones arbitrarily many times, but note that the swaps are only between specific pairs.\n\n   However, note: we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly, so the positions of 0 and 2 cannot be arbitrarily rearranged. But we can use 1's as buffers.\n\n   Another idea: we can think of the entire string as being composed of three independent sequences for the digits, but with the constraint that the 1's can be used to let 0's and 2's pass.\n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Step 1: We can note that the relative order of the zeros and twos is not arbitrary. In fact, without any ones, the zeros and twos cannot be swapped. But when ones are present, they can be used to separate zeros and twos.\n\n   However, note that the problem allows multiple swaps and the goal is the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n   Lexicographical order: we want the smallest character at the earliest position.\n\n   Let's try to understand the possible movements:\n\n   Consider the following: \n     We can move zeros to the left as long as we don't encounter a '2' that is isolated (without a '1' to help). But actually, we can use the ones to move zeros to the left and twos to the right.\n\n   Actually, we can model the problem by noting that:\n\n   - The zeros can only be blocked by twos (if there's no '1' between a zero and a two, then the zero cannot pass the two). Similarly, a two is blocked by a zero (without a one in between) from moving leftward.\n\n   But note: we can have multiple ones. So the idea is that:\n\n   We can use the ones to push zeros to the left and twos to the right.\n\n   However, we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos arbitrarily. The zeros that originally come before a two must remain before that two? Not exactly: because we can have ones in between, and we can use the ones to separate them.\n\n   Actually, the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed if we ignore the ones. Why?\n\n   Consider two zeros and two twos. Without ones, the zeros must stay before the twos. But if we have ones, we can use the ones to push zeros to the left and twos to the right, but we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n   Example: \"02\" -> cannot be swapped. But if we have \"012\", we can do:\n        \"012\" -> swap the '0' and '1': becomes \"102\"\n        Then swap the '0' (now the second character) and the '2'? No, because we can only swap adjacent '1' and '2'. So from \"102\", we can swap the '0' and the '2'?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on specific characters ('0' and '1', or '1' and '2'). The key observation is that while we can swap adjacent '0's and '1's or '1's and '2's, we cannot directly swap '0's and '2's. This means the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain unchanged, but their positions can be influenced by the presence of '1's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the given ternary string into its lexicographically smallest form using only adjacent swaps between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. Lexicographical order means that earlier characters are more significant; thus, we aim to place the smallest possible characters ('0's) as far left as possible.\n2. **Key Insight**: Since '0's can move left past '1's and '2's can move right past '1's, the optimal strategy involves:\n   - Moving all '0's to the leftmost positions possible, using '1's as intermediaries.\n   - Placing '1's next, as they can act as buffers between '0's and '2's.\n   - Finally, placing '2's in the remaining positions.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves counting the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the string. The transformed string will consist of:\n   - All '0's (counted from the original string) placed at the beginning.\n   - All '1's (counted from the original string) placed next.\n   - All '2's (counted from the original string) placed last.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the input string in linear time, making it efficient with O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string. This is optimal for the problem constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    result = '0' * count0 + '1' * count1 + '2' * count2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n- **Counting Characters**: The code counts the occurrences of '0', '1', and '2' in the input string.\n- **Constructing Result**: The result string is constructed by concatenating all '0's, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. This arrangement ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n- **Output**: The constructed string is printed, which is the desired minimum lexicographical string achievable through the allowed swaps.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps by recognizing that '0's and '2's can only be moved past '1's, leading to a straightforward and optimal solution.",
