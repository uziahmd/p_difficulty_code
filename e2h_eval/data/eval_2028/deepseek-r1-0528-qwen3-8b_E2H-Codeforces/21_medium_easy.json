The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (odd/even) of the numbers because the condition is about the sum being odd.\n Condition: a_i + b_j is odd => one must be even and the other odd.\n\n So, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes (a_i): \n        even_chest = number of even a_i\n        odd_chest = number of odd a_i\n\n   Keys (b_j):\n        even_key = number of even b_j\n        odd_key = number of key of odd b_j\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n Similarly, an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n 1. For even_chests and odd_keys: we can use at most min(even_chest, odd_key) chests from the even_chests.\n 2. For odd_chests and even_keys: we can use at most min(odd_chest, even_key) chests from the odd_chests.\n\n However, we cannot use the same key twice. But note: the keys are separated by parity and the chests by parity, and the two sets of pairs (even_chest with odd_keys and odd_chest with even_keys) do not interfere.\n\n So the maximum total chests we can open is the sum of these two minima.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        even_chest: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        odd_chest: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n        even_key: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        odd_key: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then, even_chest uses odd_keys: min(3,1)=1\n         odd_chest uses even_keys: min(2,3)=2\n   Total = 1+2 = 3.\n\n Another example: \n   \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: all even -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_key=1, even_key=0\n   Then, even_chest uses odd_keys: min(5,1)=1; odd_chest uses even_keys: min(0,0)=0 -> total 1.\n\n Third example:\n   \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n   Then, even_chest uses odd_keys: min(1,0)=0; odd_chest uses even_keys: min(0,4)=0 -> total 0.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward:\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count the even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   Print result.\n\n However, note: The condition is defined by the parity. This reasoning holds because:\n   - Even chest requires odd key.\n   - Odd chest requires even key.\n\n And the keys and chests are independent in terms of which group they can match with.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair consists of one even and one odd number. The solution involves counting how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Count the number of even and odd values in the chests and keys.\n   - The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys.\n   - Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves simple counting operations, which run in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: For both chests and keys, we count how many are even and how many are odd. This helps in determining compatible pairs.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Open Chests**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys for even chests, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys for odd chests. The sum of these two minima gives the answer.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints. \n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of compatible chest-key pairs without any complex computations or data structures.",
