Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street is from 0 to l.\n\n We note that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   a) Covering the leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern's position.\n   b) Covering the gaps between lanterns.\n   c) Covering the rightmost part: from the last lantern's position to l.\n\n However, note that if the lanterns are not covering the entire street, we need to extend with radius d.\n\n Approach:\n Let's sort the lantern array: arr\n\n The whole street must be covered. We can think:\n\n 1. The left end: the first lantern is at arr[0]. To cover 0, we must have d >= arr[0] (because the first lantern must cover from 0 to arr[0] + d, so to reach 0: arr[0] - d <= 0 -> d >= arr[0]).\n 2. Similarly, the right end: the last lantern is at arr[-1]. To cover l, we must have d >= (l - arr[-1]).\n\n 3. For the gaps between lanterns: \n    For i from 0 to n-2, the gap between arr[i] and arr[i+1] is (arr[i+1] - arr[i]). \n    The required d must be at least half of this gap because the two adjacent lanterns together must cover the gap. Specifically, the coverage from the left lantern goes to arr[i] + d and from the right lantern starts at arr[i+1] - d. We require:\n        arr[i] + d + d >= arr[i+1]\n    => d >= (arr[i+1] - arr[i]) / 2\n\n However, note that we might not need to cover the entire gap with one lantern's coverage? Actually, we require that the entire segment from arr[i] to arr[i+1] is covered. The left lantern covers up to arr[i] + d, and the right lantern covers from arr[i+1] - d. So we need:\n        arr[i] + d >= arr[i+1] - d   OR   d >= (arr[i+1] - arr[i]) / 2\n\n But note: it might be that the entire gap is covered by one lantern if the lantern is placed appropriately, but here we have two lanterns. Actually, the condition is that the two intervals [arr[i]-d, arr[i]+d] and [arr[i+1]-d, arr[i+1]+d] must overlap or meet such that there is no gap. The minimal d for the gap is (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2.\n\n However, we also have to consider the edges. So the overall answer is the maximum of three values:\n\n   candidate1 = arr[0]  (to cover from 0 to arr[0])\n   candidate2 = l - arr[-1] (to cover from arr[-1] to l)\n   candidate3 = max( (arr[i+1] - arr[i]) / 2 for i in range(n-1) )\n\n But wait, what if the lanterns are not contiguous? The above candidate3 ensures that between two consecutive lanterns the gap is covered.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be lit. Therefore, we must cover:\n   - The segment from 0 to arr[0]: requires d >= arr[0]\n   - The segment from arr[-1] to l: requires d >= l - arr[-1]\n   - The gaps between lanterns: for each gap (arr[i+1]-arr[i]), the required d is (gap)/2.\n\n But note: the lanterns might not be placed in sorted order? We sorted them, so they are in increasing order.\n\n However, what if there are duplicate lanterns? Then the gap between two same positions is 0, which is okay.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   d1 = arr[0]   # because if the first lantern is at x, then to cover 0, we need x-d <= 0 -> d>=x, but actually the distance from 0 to x is x, so we need d>=x to cover 0 (since the lantern at x will cover from x-d to x+d; we require x-d<=0 -> d>=x). Similarly, for the right: d>=l-arr[-1]\n\n   d2 = (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2 for each gap, and take the maximum.\n\n Then the answer is the maximum of d1, d2, and (l - arr[-1])?\n\n Actually, we have two edge cases and the middle gaps. So:\n\n   candidate_left = arr[0]  (if we set d = arr[0], then the first lantern covers from 0 to arr[0]+arr[0] = 2*arr[0]? Actually, no: the condition is that the left edge 0 must be covered by the first lantern: the first lantern must have d at least arr[0] (so that the left side of the first lantern extends to 0). Similarly, the right edge requires d at least (l - arr[-1]).\n\n   candidate_right = l - arr[-1]\n\n   candidate_gap = for each i from 0 to n-2: (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2\n\n Then the minimal d is the maximum of these three.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n      n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n      candidate_left = 2\n      candidate_right = 5-5 = 0\n      candidate_gap = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n      Then d = max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> which matches the sample.\n\n   Another example: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n      Sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n      candidate_left = 0\n      candidate_right = 15-15 = 0\n      candidate_gaps: \n          3-0 = 3 -> 1.5\n          5-3 = 2 -> 1.0\n          7-5 = 2 -> 1.0\n          9-7 = 2 -> 1.0\n          14-9 = 5 -> 2.5\n          15-14 = 1 -> 0.5\n      Then d = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n   So output is 2.5\n\n But wait: the example input was given as '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' and expected output is 2.5.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. With d=2.5:\n\n   The lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> but we only care from 0 to 15, so [0,2.5] is covered.\n   The lantern at 3: covers [0.5,5.5] -> so from 0.5 to 5.5. Now, from 0 to 2.5 is already covered, so the gap from 2.5 to 0.5? Actually, the next lantern at 3 is at 3, so the coverage from 3-2.5=0.5 to 3+2.5=5.5. This covers [0.5,5.5]. The previous lantern at 0 covers [0,2.5]. So the entire segment from 0 to 5.5 is covered.\n\n   Then the next lantern at 5: covers [2.5,7.5] -> now from 5.5 to 7.5 is covered by this one? But wait, the gap from 5 to 7: the lantern at 5 covers up to 7.5, so from 5 to 7.5 is covered. Then 7 is covered by the lantern at 7: [7-2.5=4.5, 9.5]. So from 4.5 to 9.5. Then the lantern at 9: [6.5,11.5] and the lantern at 14: [11.5,16.5] and 15: [12.5,17.5]. \n\n   However, let's check the entire street [0,15]:\n\n     0 to 2.5: covered by 0 and 3 (overlap is okay)\n     2.5 to 5.5: covered by 3 and 5 (overlap again)\n     5.5 to 7.5: covered by 5 and 7 (overlap)\n     7.5 to 9.5: covered by 7 and 9 (overlap)\n     9.5 to 11.5: covered by 9 and 14 (wait, 14 is at 14, so from 11.5 to 16.5) -> so 9.5 to 11.5 is covered by 9 and 14? Actually, 9 covers up to 9+2.5=11.5, so 9.5 to 11.5 is covered by 9. Then 11.5 to 12.5 is covered by 14? Actually, 14's coverage starts at 14-2.5=11.5, so 11.5 to 16.5. Then 12.5 to 15 is covered by 15? 15's coverage is from 12.5 to 17.5. So yes, the entire street is covered.\n\n   But note: the requirement is the minimal d. Why is 2.5 minimal? Because if we take d=2.4:\n\n     The gap between 9 and 14: 14-9=5, so we require at least 5/2 = 2.5 to cover the gap. If we use 2.4, then the left lantern (at 9) covers up to 9+2.4=11.4, and the right lantern (at 14) starts at 14-2.4=11.6. There is a gap from 11.4 to 11.6 (i.e., 0.2 units) which is not covered. Therefore, 2.5 is indeed the minimal.\n\n So the algorithm:\n\n   Read n, l\n   Read the list of n integers\n\n   Sort the list\n\n   Compute:\n      candidate_left = arr[0]   (if the first lantern is at arr[0], then d must be at least arr[0] to cover 0)\n      candidate_right = l - arr[-1]\n      candidate_gap = 0\n      for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n          gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n          candidate_gap = max(candidate_gap, gap / 2)\n\n   Then answer = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_gap)\n\n   Print the answer with 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: what if there is only one lantern?\n   Example: n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5.\n   Then candidate_left = 5, candidate_right = 10-5=5, candidate_gap (no gap) = 0 -> then answer=5.\n\n   Check: with d=5, the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] -> correct.\n\n   What if the lantern is at 0? Then candidate_left=0, candidate_right=l-0=l, candidate_gap=0 -> then answer=l.\n\n   Check: with d=l, the lantern at 0 covers [ -l, l] -> so the street [0,l] is covered.\n\n   But wait: what if the lantern is at 0 and l=10, then d=10. However, we don't need to cover beyond 0 on the left? Actually, the street is from 0 to 10. The lantern at 0 with d=10 covers [0-10, 0+10] = [-10,10] which covers [0,10]. So yes.\n\n   However, the minimal d for a single lantern at 0 should be l (because the right end is at l, so we need to cover from 0 to l: the distance from 0 to l is l, so the lantern must have d>=l/2? Actually, no: the lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to l. The coverage is [0-d, 0+d] but we don't care about negative, so the rightmost point is 0+d. We require 0+d >= l -> d>=l.\n\n   But wait, that's not the case. The lantern at 0: the rightmost point it covers is 0+d. We require 0+d >= l -> d>=l.\n\n   Similarly, if the lantern is at l, then we require d>=l (to cover from 0 to l: the leftmost point is l-d, so we require l-d<=0 -> d>=l).\n\n   However, our method for the single lantern at 0: \n        candidate_left = 0\n        candidate_right = l - 0 = l\n        candidate_gap = 0\n        Then d = max(0, l, 0) = l.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   But wait: if the lantern is in the middle, say at 5 for l=10, then we require d=5? Actually, with d=5, the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] (because 5-5=0 and 5+5=10). So that works.\n\n   However, according to our formula: \n        candidate_left = 5 (distance from 0 to 5)\n        candidate_right = 10-5=5\n        candidate_gap = 0\n        Then d = 5.\n\n   But note: if the lantern is at 5, then the minimal d is 5? Actually, we can do with less? Let me check: \n        The entire street is from 0 to 10. The lantern at 5 must cover both ends. The left end is 0: so 5-d <= 0 -> d>=5. Similarly, the right end: 5+d>=10 -> d>=5. So indeed 5 is the minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: the lantern lights all points at most d from it. So for the lantern at 5, the point 0 is at distance 5, so d must be at least 5 to cover 0. Similarly for 10.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Steps:\n     n, l = map(int, input().split())\n     arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n     arr.sort()\n\n     left_cover = arr[0]   # because the first lantern is at arr[0]; the left end is 0, so the distance from 0 to the lantern is arr[0], so d must be at least arr[0] to cover 0.\n     right_cover = l - arr[-1]\n     gap_cover = 0.0\n\n     for i in range(1, n):\n         gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n         # The minimal d to cover the gap between two consecutive lanterns is gap/2.\n         if gap > 2 * gap_cover:   # we can update only when we find a larger gap requirement\n             gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n     # But note: the above loop doesn't account for the fact that we might have multiple gaps, so we should take the maximum gap/2.\n\n     Actually, we can do:\n\n        gap_cover = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n            if gap / 2.0 > gap_cover:\n                gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n     Then answer = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\n   However, we can compute the gaps in one pass and take the maximum.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        gap_cover = 0.0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap_cover = max(gap_cover, (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) / 2.0)\n\n   Then combine.\n\n   But note: if there are no lanterns? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Example: n=1, then the for loop doesn't run, so gap_cover remains 0.0, then answer = max(arr[0], l-arr[0], 0.0). For n=1, arr has one element.\n\n   Example with n=1, l=10, arr=[5]:\n        left_cover = 5, right_cover=5, gap_cover=0 -> answer=5.\n\n   Example with n=1, l=10, arr=[0]:\n        left_cover=0, right_cover=10, gap_cover=0 -> answer=10.\n\n   Example with n=1, l=10, arr=[10]:\n        left_cover=10, right_cover=0, gap_cover=0 -> answer=10.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: if the lantern is at 0 and l=10, then the lantern must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 0 to 10 is 10, so d must be at least 10. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the lantern at 0 with d=10 covers [0-10, 0+10] = [-10,10] which includes [0,10]. So correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   arr.sort()\n\n   left_cover = arr[0]\n   right_cover = l - arr[-1]\n\n   # If there is only one lantern, then the gaps loop won't run, so we set gap_cover to 0.0.\n   gap_cover = 0.0\n   if n > 1:\n       for i in range(1, n):\n           gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n           # We don't need to consider gaps that are negative because sorted.\n           gap_cover = max(gap_cover, gap / 2.0)\n\n   ans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\n   Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer should have an absolute or relative error <= 1e-9.\n\n   We can print with formatting:\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait: what if the maximum is an integer? Then we still want 10 decimal places.\n\n   Example: if ans=2, then output \"2.0000000000\"\n\n   The formatting does that.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   First example: n=7, l=15, arr=[0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        left_cover=0, right_cover=0, and the maximum gap/2 is (14-9)=5 -> 5/2=2.5, so ans=2.5 -> formatted to \"2.5000000000\"\n\n   Second example: n=2, l=5, arr=[2,5] (after sorting)\n        left_cover=2, right_cover=0, gap_cover=(5-2)/2=1.5 -> ans=2.0 -> wait, no: we are taking max(2,0,1.5)=2.0.\n\n   But wait: the second example input is \"2 5\\n2 5\", and the expected output is \"2.0000000000\", so that's correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input string in the problem is given as:\n\n      Input: \n        ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   This is a list of two strings. But in the problem, the input is two separate lines.\n\n   Our code reads the first integer from the first token, then the next line.\n\n   But the example input is provided as a string. In competitive programming, the input comes from stdin.\n\n   We assume standard input.\n\n   Let me run through the example:\n\n      Input: \"2 5\" and then next line \"2 5\"\n\n      n=2, l=5\n      arr = [2,5]\n\n      left_cover = 2\n      right_cover = 5-5 = 0\n      gap_cover = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n      ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> formatted to \"2.0000000000\"\n\n   That's correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input has two lanterns at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5.\n\n   With d=2:\n        Lantern at 2: covers [0,4] (from 2-2=0 to 2+2=4)\n        Lantern at 5: covers [3,7] (but the street ends at 5, so [3,5])\n\n   The entire street is [0,5]. We have:\n        [0,4] and [3,5] -> the gap between 4 and 3 is covered? Actually, the point 4 is covered by the first lantern and 3 is covered by the second. But the segment from 3 to 4 is covered by both. However, what about the point 0 to 2? The first lantern covers [0,4] so that's okay. And from 3 to 5: the second lantern covers [3,5]. But wait, the point 2.5? It is covered by the first lantern (since 2.5 is between 0 and 4). The point 4.5? The first lantern only goes to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3, but 4.5 is in [3,5] so covered. But wait, the second lantern's coverage starts at 3, so 3 to 5 is covered. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   However, note: the entire street must be covered. The point 5 is covered by the second lantern (since 5 is the center and d=2: 5-2=3, so 5 is included). But wait, the street ends at 5, and we require the entire street including 5 to be covered.\n\n   But note: the second lantern at 5 covers from 3 to 7, so 5 is included. Also, the first lantern covers up to 4, so the point 4.5 is covered by the second lantern.\n\n   However, wait: the sample note says: \n        \"At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\"\n\n   So yes, the whole street [0,5] is the union [0,4] ∪ [3,5] = [0,5]. \n\n   Therefore, the answer 2.0 is correct.\n\n   But note: the minimal d must be 2.0. Why not 1.999...? \n\n        With d=1.999, the first lantern covers [0-1.999, 2+1.999] = [-1.999, 3.999] and the second lantern covers [5-1.999, 5+1.999] = [3.001, 6.999]. \n\n        Then the gap: from 3.999 to 3.001? Actually, the first lantern's right end is 3.999 and the second lantern's left end is 3.001. Since 3.999 < 3.001, there is a gap from 3.999 to 3.001? Actually, 3.999 is greater than 3.001, so the intervals [0,3.999] and [3.001,6.999] do not overlap. The point 3.001 to 3.999 is covered by the second lantern? No, because the second lantern starts at 3.001, so the entire interval [3.001, 3.999] is covered by both? Actually, no: the first lantern goes up to 3.999, and the second lantern starts at 3.001, so the entire [0,6.999] is covered. But wait, the gap between the two lanterns is from 2 to 5. The first lantern is at 2, so it covers up to 2+1.999=3.999. The second lantern is at 5, so it starts at 5-1.999=3.001. The point 3.001 is covered by the second lantern, and the point 3.999 is covered by the first. But what about the point 3.5? 3.5 is less than 3.999 and greater than 3.001, so it is covered by both.\n\n   However, wait: the first lantern's coverage goes to 3.999, and the second lantern's coverage starts at 3.001. There is no gap because 3.001 <= 3.999. So the entire street is covered even with d=1.999? \n\n   Then why is 2.0 the minimal? \n\n   Let me check the gap between the two lanterns: the two lanterns are at 2 and 5. The distance between them is 3. The minimal d to cover the gap is (5-2)/2 = 1.5, but wait, that is the minimal d to cover the gap between the two lanterns without considering the edges. However, we must also cover the edges. \n\n   The edge at 0 requires d>=2 (because the first lantern must reach 0). The edge at 5 requires d>=0 (since the second lantern is at 5, and 5-d <=5 is always true, and we require 5+d>=5 which is always true for positive d). \n\n   So the constraint from the left edge (0) forces d>=2. Therefore, 2 is the minimal.\n\n   In our calculation, we did:\n\n        left_cover = 2 (from the first lantern at 2, to cover 0 we need d>=2)\n        right_cover = 0\n        gap_cover = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then we took the maximum of 2,0,1.5 -> 2.\n\n   So the algorithm is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: We must use floating point for the gaps.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't handle.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   arr.sort()\n\n   left_cover = arr[0]\n   right_cover = l - arr[-1]\n\n   gap_cover = 0.0\n   if n > 1:\n       for i in range(1, n):\n           gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n           # The minimal d for this gap is gap/2\n           if gap > 2 * gap_cover:\n               gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n   # Alternatively, we can use:\n   #   gap_cover = 0.0\n   #   for i in range(1, n):\n   #       gap_cover = max(gap_cover, arr[i]-arr[i-1]/2.0)\n\n   # But the above if condition is equivalent.\n\n   ans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=7, l=15, arr=[0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        left_cover=0, right_cover=0, gap_cover = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) = max(1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n   Example 2: n=2, l=5, arr=[2,5] -> ans=2.0\n\n   Example 3: n=1, l=10, arr=[5] -> ans=5.0\n\n   Example 4: n=1, l=10, arr=[0] -> ans=10.0\n\n   Example 5: n=1, l=10, arr=[10] -> ans=10.0\n\n   Example 6: n=3, l=10, arr=[0,5,10] -> \n        left_cover=0, right_cover=0, gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5 -> ans=2.5\n\n   Example 7: n=3, l=10, arr=[0,0,10] -> \n        left_cover=0, right_cover=0, gaps: (0-0)/2=0, (10-0)/2=5 -> ans=5.0\n\n   Example 8: n=3, l=10, arr=[0,10,10] -> \n        left_cover=0, right_cover=0, gaps: (10-0)/2=5, (10-10)/2=0 -> ans=5.0\n\n   All these examples seem correct.\n\n   However, note: in example 7, the lanterns at 0 and 10. The street is from 0 to 10. The lantern at 0 requires d>=0 (to cover 0) but to cover the entire street we need the lantern at 0 to cover up to 10? Actually, the lantern at 0 must have d>=10 to cover 10. But wait, the street is from 0 to 10, so the point 10 must be covered. The lantern at 10 is present, so the lantern at 10 covers from 10-d to 10+d. But the lantern at 0 also covers from 0-d to 0+d. The entire street must be covered. The gap between 0 and 10 is 10, so the minimal d to cover the entire street is 5 (because the two lanterns together must cover the gap: the left lantern goes to 0+5=5, the right lantern starts at 10-5=5, so they meet at 5). However, the edge condition for the left: the left lantern is at 0, so to cover 0 we require d>=0 (which is always satisfied). The edge condition for the right: the right lantern is at 10, so to cover 10 we require d>=0 (because the right lantern is at 10, so 10-d<=10 and 10+d>=10). But wait, the entire street from 0 to 10 must be covered. The left lantern with d=5 covers [ -5,5] and the right lantern with d=5 covers [5,15]. The union is [ -5,15] which covers [0,10]. \n\n   However, the minimal d must be at least 5. But note: the left edge 0 is covered by the left lantern as long as d>=0, and the right edge 10 is covered by the right lantern as long as d>=0. But the gap between 0 and 10 is 10, and the minimal d for the gap is 5 (because (10-0)/2=5). So the answer is 5.\n\n   The code gives 5.0.\n\n   But wait, in example 7, the input is [0,0,10] (three lanterns). The two gaps: [0,0] and [0,10]. The gap [0,0] requires 0, and [0,10] requires 5. Then the maximum of 0 (left_cover) [because the first lantern is at 0, so left_cover=0], 0 (right_cover=10-10=0), and 5 -> 5.\n\n   However, note: the left_cover is the distance from 0 to the first lantern (which is 0). The right_cover is the distance from the last lantern (10) to l (10), which is 0. The gap_cover is 5. So 5 is the answer.\n\n   But what if we remove the duplicate? Example 6: n=3, l=10, arr=[0,5,10] -> the gaps are [0,5] and [5,10]. Each gap requires 2.5. Then the left_cover=0, right_cover=0, gap_cover=2.5 -> ans=2.5.\n\n   Why is that? Because with d=2.5, the first lantern at 0 covers [0-2.5,0+2.5]=[-2.5,2.5] (so up to 2.5). The second lantern at 5 covers [2.5,7.5]. The third lantern at 10 covers [7.5,12.5]. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   One more: n=3, l=10, arr=[0,1,9] -> \n        left_cover=0\n        right_cover=10-9=1\n        gaps: (1-0)=1 -> 0.5, (9-1)=8 -> 4.0\n        ans = max(0,1,4.0)=4.0\n\n   Check: with d=4.0, \n        first lantern (0): [-4,4] -> covers [0,4]\n        second lantern (1): [-3,5] -> covers [0,5] (overlaps)\n        third lantern (9): [5,13] -> covers [5,10]\n\n   The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But can we use less than 4.0? The gap between 1 and 9 is 8, so we require at least 4.0 to cover the gap (because the second lantern at 1 can cover up to 1+d, and the third at 9 can cover from 9-d. We require 1+d >= 9-d -> 2*d>=8 -> d>=4.0). So yes.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the street length is l, and the lanterns are at positions ai (0<=ai<=l). The entire street is [0, l]. \n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   arr.sort()\n\n   left_cover = arr[0]\n   right_cover = l - arr[-1]\n\n   gap_cover = 0.0\n   if n > 1:\n       for i in range(1, n):\n           gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n           if gap / 2.0 > gap_cover:\n               gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n   ans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   Or we can use:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   left_cover = arr[0]\n   right_cover = l - arr[-1]\n   gap_cover = 0.0\n\n   for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n       gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n       if gap > 2 * gap_cover:\n           gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n   ans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\n   print(\"{",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, and lanterns are placed at certain positions. The challenge is to ensure that the entire street is covered by the union of the intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for all lantern positions `a_i`. The minimal `d` must satisfy three conditions:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the starting point `0`, so `d` must be at least the distance from `0` to the first lantern.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the ending point `l`, so `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: Between any two consecutive lanterns, the combined coverage of both lanterns must bridge the gap between them. The minimal `d` required for a gap between two consecutive lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the lantern positions to easily compute gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Edge Cases Handling**: Calculate the required `d` for covering the leftmost and rightmost parts of the street separately.\n   - **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the minimal `d` needed to cover the gap between them and take the maximum value among all such gaps.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the lantern positions takes `O(n log n)` time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent loop to compute gaps runs in `O(n)` time. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it efficient for the given constraints (`n ≤ 1000`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\narr.sort()\n\nleft_cover = arr[0]\nright_cover = l - arr[-1]\n\ngap_cover = 0.0\nif n > 1:\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n        if gap > 2 * gap_cover:\n            gap_cover = gap / 2.0\n\nans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gap_cover)\n\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order.\n3. **Edge Coverage Calculation**: \n   - `left_cover` is the distance from the start of the street (`0`) to the first lantern, ensuring the first lantern covers the starting point.\n   - `right_cover` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`), ensuring the last lantern covers the endpoint.\n4. **Gap Coverage Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the code calculates the minimal `d` required to cover the gap between them. The maximum value among all these gaps is stored in `gap_cover`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value among `left_cover`, `right_cover`, and `gap_cover`, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements. \n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal light radius by addressing the coverage requirements for the street edges and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
