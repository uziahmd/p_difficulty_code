In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single input line. However, the example input is given as a list of strings, but the actual input will be one line with three space-separated strings? Actually, looking at the example:\n\n Input: \n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n Each tile is represented as a two-character string: digit and then one of 'm','p','s'. And there are three tiles.\n\n So the input is one line with three tiles, but note: the example input is shown as three separate examples, each being a string of three tiles? \n\n Actually, reading the example again:\n\n Example Input:\n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems to be three examples. But the problem says: \"The only line\" meaning one test case per run? Or multiple test cases?\n\n Let me read the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then it describes the problem.\n\n Then the example input has three examples. However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n So for a single test case, the input is one line with three strings (each string being a tile). But note: the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string containing three tiles? \n\n Actually, wait: the example input format is ambiguous. The example output is also given as a list of three strings: ['0','0','1'].\n\n But the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\n And the example input is provided as three examples, so likely the program should handle one test case.\n\n Clarification from the example: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> Output: 0\n   Input: \"9m 9m 9m\" -> Output: 0\n   Input: \"3p 9m 2p\" -> Output: 1\n\n However, the problem states that the input is one line with three strings (the three tiles). So we have three tiles.\n\n But wait, the example input format in the problem is written as:\n\n Input:\n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing because the example input is actually three separate test cases? Or one test case with three tiles?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one test case with three tiles.\n\n However, the example input is shown as a list of three strings, each being a representation of the entire hand for an example. \n\n But the sample input format might be:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So each string is a tile? Or three tiles separated by spaces?\n\n Let me re-read: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n And there are three tiles.\n\n So the input is three two-character strings. They can be provided as three separate tokens on the same line.\n\n Example input line: \"1s2s3s\" — but wait, no, the problem says \"three strings\", so they are space separated.\n\n Example input line: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n So we have one line with three tokens.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split into three tokens.\n 2. Each token is a tile (two characters).\n\n We have three tiles.\n\n We want to know the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we can form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Note: We can draw any tile (anywhere from 1 to 9 and any suit) as many times as we want.\n\n We start with three tiles. We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Already have a mentsu (then answer 0).\n\n Option 2: With one extra tile, can we form a mentsu?\n Option 3: With two extra tiles, can we form a mentsu?\n Option 4: With three extra tiles, we can always form a koutsu by drawing three copies of one of the existing tile? But note: we can also form a shuntsu, but note: we can have up to 5 tiles (3 original + 2 drawn) and we need to form a mentsu (3 tiles). However, the problem asks the minimum number.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\n2. **Check for One Extra Tile**: If no mentsu is found, we then check if adding one extra tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu Check**: For each unique tile in the hand, count how many more are needed to complete a triplet (3 copies). If any tile requires just one more copy, then one extra tile suffices.\n   - **Shuntsu Check**: For each unique suit in the hand, look for sequences that can be completed with one additional tile. For example, if we have two tiles of the same suit with numbers `a` and `b`, we check if there exists a number `c` such that `{a, b, c}` forms a sequence (i.e., the numbers are consecutive).\n\n3. **Check for Two Extra Tiles**: If one extra tile doesn't suffice, we then check if two extra tiles can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: For each tile, if two more copies are needed to complete a triplet, then two extra tiles are sufficient.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: For each suit, check all possible sequences that can be formed by adding two tiles. For example, if we have two tiles in the same suit with numbers `a` and `b`, check if adding two specific numbers can form a sequence.\n\n4. **Default Case**: If none of the above checks pass, the answer is three extra tiles. This is because with four tiles, it's always possible to form a mentsu (for instance, by completing a triplet with three identical tiles).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing mentsu\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one extra tile\n    if one_extra_tile_possible(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for two extra tiles\n    if two_extra_tiles_possible(tiles):\n        print(2)\n        return\n        \n    print(3)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(tiles)\n    for tile, cnt in count.items():\n        if cnt >= 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles):\n    count_suits = Counter([t[1] for t in tiles])\n    for suit in count_suits:\n        suit_tiles = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n        if len(suit_tiles) < 2:\n            continue\n        for i in range(len(suit_tiles)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(suit_tiles)):\n                num1, num2 = sorted([suit_tiles[i], suit_tiles[j]])\n                if num2 == num1 + 1:\n                    target = num1 -

Let's say we have two tiles with numbers a and b (a < b). The sequence would require three numbers: x, x+1, x+2. We can use a and b if they are two of these three. The gap between a and b should be at most 2 (if they are consecutive or apart by one) but if they are apart by more than 2, then we cannot form a sequence with these two and two extra tiles? Actually, no: we might have two tiles that are not adjacent in the sequence but still form part of a sequence with two extra tiles. For example, if we have [1, 4] then we can add 2 and 3 to form [1,2,3,4] which includes [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. But note: we only need one sequence of three. So if we have [1,4], then adding 2 and 3 gives two sequences: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]. \n                    # However, the problem is: we are only concerned with forming one mentsu (sequence or triplet). So if we can form a sequence with two extra tiles, then two is enough.\n                    # But our function two_extra_tiles_possible is called after one_extra_tile didn't work. So we are checking if two extra tiles can form a mentsu anywhere (not necessarily involving the two tiles we picked). However, the above nested loops are over pairs in the same suit. We need to check if there exists a pair in the same suit such that the gap between them allows forming a sequence with two extra tiles? Actually, the gap doesn't matter as long as we can form a sequence with two extra tiles. But note: we might have multiple suits. Alternatively, we can think: for each suit, if there are at least two distinct tiles, then we can try to see if by adding two tiles we can form a sequence. But this is complex.\n\n                    # Alternatively, we can consider: if we have two tiles of the same suit, then we can check all possible sequences that include at least one of these tiles and see if the other two tiles can be drawn. But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So the condition for two extra tiles is: there exists a sequence (three consecutive numbers in a suit) such that the hand has at least one tile from that sequence. Then we can draw the other two. Similarly, for a triplet: if we have one tile, then drawing two more of the same tile forms a triplet.\n\n                    # Actually, we already checked for triplet with one extra tile (two copies needed). Now for two extra tiles, we can check for:\n                    #   - Triplet: if there is at least one tile (count=1), then drawing two more forms a triplet.\n                    #   - Sequence: if there is at least one tile in a suit, then we can form a sequence if the suit has at least three consecutive numbers including one from the hand. But since we can draw any tiles, we can always form a sequence if the hand has at least one tile in a suit and we are allowed to draw two tiles. However, consider: if the hand has one tile, say 5m, then we can draw 4m and 6m to form [4m,5m,6m]. Similarly, if the hand has two tiles of the same suit, say 4m and 6m, then we can draw 5m to form a sequence. But wait, two extra tiles for a sequence: we need to draw two tiles. So if we have two tiles of the same suit, we might need to draw one tile to complete a sequence (which is covered in one_extra_tile). For two extra tiles, we are looking for cases where no one extra tile completes a mentsu, but two do.\n\n                    # Therefore, the two_extra_tiles_possible function can be simplified: \n                    #   If there is at least one tile (any tile) then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of that tile.\n                    #   Or, if there is at least two distinct tiles in the same suit, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (if necessary). However, note that we might have two tiles that are not consecutive, so we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles. But actually, even if we have only one tile, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (as shown above). So the condition is: if the hand has at least one tile, then two extra tiles are always sufficient? Not exactly: what if the hand has three tiles, all different suits and numbers? Then we can draw two tiles of the same suit and number as one of them to form a triplet. So the answer for two extra tiles is always \"yes\" if one extra tile didn't work? \n\n                    # But wait, let me test with an example: hand = ['1m', '2p', '3s'] (all different). Then one extra tile: \n                    #   Koutsu: no tile has two copies -> no.\n                    #   Shuntsu: no two tiles of the same suit -> no.\n                    #   Then one_extra_tile: \n                    #       Koutsu: no tile with two copies -> no.\n                    #       Shuntsu: for each suit, only one tile -> no.\n                    #   Then two_extra_tiles: \n                    #       Koutsu: each tile has one copy, so drawing two more of any tile (say '1m') forms a triplet -> yes.\n                    #   So indeed, two extra tiles are sufficient.\n\n                    # However, consider another example: hand = ['1m', '1m', '2p'] (already two same).

If so, it prints `0` and exits.\n2. **One Extra Tile Check**: If no mentsu is found, the code checks if adding one extra tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking for both triplets (two copies of a tile) and sequences (two tiles that can be part of a three-number sequence).\n3. **Two Extra Tiles Check**: If one extra tile isn't sufficient, the code checks if two extra tiles can form a mentsu. This is primarily checking if two more copies of any tile can form a triplet, which is always possible with three tiles in hand.\n4. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is `3` because with four tiles, it's guaranteed to form a mentsu (by completing a triplet).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the constraints and properties of mentsu, ensuring minimal draws while covering all edge cases.",

Let's say we have two tiles with numbers a and b (a < b). The sequence would require three numbers: x, x+1, x+2. We can use a and b if they are two of these three. The gap between a and b should be at most 2 (if they are consecutive or apart by one) but if they are apart by more than 2, then we cannot form a sequence with these two and two extra tiles? Actually, no: we might have two tiles that are not adjacent in the sequence but still form part of a sequence with two extra tiles. For example, if we have [1, 4] then we can add 2 and 3 to form [1,2,3,4] which includes [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. But note: we only need one sequence of three. So if we have [1,4], then adding 2 and 3 gives two sequences: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]. \n                    # However, the problem is: we are only concerned with forming one mentsu (sequence or triplet). So if we can form a sequence with two extra tiles, then two is enough.\n                    # But our function two_extra_tiles_possible is called after one_extra_tile didn't work. So we are checking if two extra tiles can form a mentsu anywhere (not necessarily involving the two tiles we picked). However, the above nested loops are over pairs in the same suit. We need to check if there exists a pair in the same suit such that the gap between them allows forming a sequence with two extra tiles? Actually, the gap doesn't matter as long as we can form a sequence with two extra tiles. But note: we might have multiple suits. Alternatively, we can think: for each suit, if there are at least two distinct tiles, then we can try to see if by adding two tiles we can form a sequence. But this is complex.\n\n                    # Alternatively, we can consider: if we have two tiles of the same suit, then we can check all possible sequences that include at least one of these tiles and see if the other two tiles can be drawn. But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So the condition for two extra tiles is: there exists a sequence (three consecutive numbers in a suit) such that the hand has at least one tile from that sequence. Then we can draw the other two. Similarly, for a triplet: if we have one tile, then drawing two more of the same tile forms a triplet.\n\n                    # Actually, we already checked for triplet with one extra tile (two copies needed). Now for two extra tiles, we can check for:\n                    #   - Triplet: if there is at least one tile (count=1), then drawing two more forms a triplet.\n                    #   - Sequence: if there is at least one tile in a suit, then we can form a sequence if the suit has at least three consecutive numbers including one from the hand. But since we can draw any tiles, we can always form a sequence if the hand has at least one tile in a suit and we are allowed to draw two tiles. However, consider: if the hand has one tile, say 5m, then we can draw 4m and 6m to form [4m,5m,6m]. Similarly, if the hand has two tiles of the same suit, say 4m and 6m, then we can draw 5m to form a sequence. But wait, two extra tiles for a sequence: we need to draw two tiles. So if we have two tiles of the same suit, we might need to draw one tile to complete a sequence (which is covered in one_extra_tile). For two extra tiles, we are looking for cases where no one extra tile completes a mentsu, but two do.\n\n                    # Therefore, the two_extra_tiles_possible function can be simplified: \n                    #   If there is at least one tile (any tile) then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of that tile.\n                    #   Or, if there is at least two distinct tiles in the same suit, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (if necessary). However, note that we might have two tiles that are not consecutive, so we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles. But actually, even if we have only one tile, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (as shown above). So the condition is: if the hand has at least one tile, then two extra tiles are always sufficient? Not exactly: what if the hand has three tiles, all different suits and numbers? Then we can draw two tiles of the same suit and number as one of them to form a triplet. So the answer for two extra tiles is always \"yes\" if one extra tile didn't work? \n\n                    # But wait, let me test with an example: hand = ['1m', '2p', '3s'] (all different).
