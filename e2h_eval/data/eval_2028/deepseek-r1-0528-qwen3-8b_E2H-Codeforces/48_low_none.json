He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one which might be 'R' (for Roman numerals) for b.\n Then a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). However, note that if b is 'R', then the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 (and not zero).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the second token is 'R', then we need to convert the given string (which is in base a) to an integer (base 10) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral in base b? Wait, wait.\n\n Let me read again: The lock description says: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\" And if the second part is R, then base b is Roman.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. ... c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n So if b is 'R', then we are to convert the number (given in base a) to its Roman numeral representation.\n\n However, note: the example input: \n   \"16 R\\n5\" -> output \"V\"\n   \"5 R\\n4\" -> output \"IV\"\n\n This means:\n   First, interpret the given number string (in base a) as a base-a number to get an integer.\n   Then, if b is 'R', convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n But wait, what if the base a is greater than 10? Then the digits in the string can be from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' onward. For example, base 12 uses digits 0-9 and A (for 10). \n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (so we'll have two integers a and b)\n   - Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer.\n   - Then convert that base-10 integer to base b (with digits: if b<=10, then use digits 0-9; if b>10, then use digits 0-9 followed by letters starting from 'A' for 10, then 'B' for 11, etc.)\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   - Convert the string c (base a) to base-10 integer.\n   - Then convert that base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note: the example \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> output \"1111001\". This is because we are converting from base2 to base2. So we must not change the value, just represent the same number in base2.\n\n But note: the problem says that if b is 'R', then the number (in base10) is at most 300010 (and not zero). Also, the input number c in base a has up to 1000 digits, so we cannot convert to base10 by standard int conversion if the base is high and the string is long (because the number might be astronomically large). However, the problem also says that in any case other than Roman, the number won't be greater than 10^1510? Actually, wait: the input says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", but wait: 101510 is 10^1510? Or maybe it's a typo? Actually, the example input says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", but that seems too small. However, note the constraint: the length of c is <= 1000. \n\n Let me clarify: \n   - When b is not 'R', the number (base10) is at most 10^1510? Or the number in base a (with a>=2) and up to 1000 digits? That could be very big. \n\n But wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", meaning 10^1510? Or 101510? Actually, the problem statement says: \"the number won't be greater than 101510\". But 101510 is a fixed number. However, the example input includes numbers that are large, like base2 with 7 digits (which is ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a base-10 integer, and then converting that integer to the desired output base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base `a` and the target base `b`. The target base might be 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **String Conversion to Base-10**: Convert the input string (which represents a number in base `a`) into a base-10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, where digits can be numbers or letters (for bases greater than 10).\n3. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base-10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base-10 number to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral representation, ensuring correct handling of subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numerals(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    roman_map = [\n        ('M', 1000),\n        ('CM', 900),\n        ('D', 500),\n        ('CD', 400),\n        ('C', 100),\n        ('XC', 90),\n        ('L', 50),\n        ('XL', 40),\n        ('X', 10),\n        ('IX', 9),\n        ('V', 5),\n        ('IV', 4),\n        ('I', 1)\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for numeral, value in roman_map:\n        while n >= value:\n            res.append(numeral)\n            n -= value\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n\n    digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    \n    base_a = a\n    base_b = b\n\n    num_base10 = 0\n    negative = False\n    for char in num_str:\n        if char == '-':\n            negative = True\n            continue\n        if char in digits:\n            pos = digits.index(char)\n            if pos >= base_a:\n                print(\"Invalid digit for base\", base_a)\n                return\n            num_base10 = num_base10 * base_a + pos\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid character in input\")\n            return\n\n    if negative and num_base10 == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    elif negative:\n        num_base10 = -num_base10\n\n    if num_base10 == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        if num_base10 < 1 or num_base10 > 3000:\n            print(\"Number out of range for Roman numerals\")\n            return\n        roman_rep = roman_numerals(int(abs(num_base10)))\n        print(roman_rep)\n    else:\n        base = base_b\n        if base < 2 or base > 36:\n            print(\"Base must be between 2 and 36\")\n            return\n\n        if num_base10 < 0:\n            print(\"-\" + convert_to_base(abs(num_base10), base))\n        else:\n            result = convert_to_base(num_base10, base)\n            print(result)\n\ndef convert_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    res = []\n    while n:\n        n, r = divmod(n, base)\n        res.append(digits[r])\n    return ''.join(res[::-1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values, including the source base `a`, target base `b` (which might be 'R'), and the number string `c`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is processed digit by digit to convert it into a base-10 integer. Each digit's value is determined by its position in the digit set (0-9 followed by A-Z), and the conversion uses standard positional notation.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - For integer bases, the base-10 number is converted by repeatedly dividing by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their corresponding digits.\n   - For Roman numerals, the base-10 number is converted using a predefined mapping of values to Roman numeral symbols, handling subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4) correctly.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The program checks for invalid inputs, such as digits out of range for the specified base, negative numbers, and zero values, ensuring robustness and correctness.",
