Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street is from 0 to l.\n\n We note that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   a) Covering the leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The first lantern at position x0 should cover 0. So we require: d >= x0/2 (because from x0 we go left to 0, so half the distance from x0 to 0).\n\n   b) Covering the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n        For two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]:\n            The gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover the entire gap, the light from the left lantern must extend to at least a[i] + d1, and the light from the right lantern must extend to at least a[i+1] - d2.\n            But since both have the same radius d, we require that d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 to cover the gap in the middle.\n\n   c) Covering the rightmost part: from the last lantern to l.\n        The last lantern at position x_last should cover l. So we require: d >= (l - x_last) / 2.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use the same d for all lanterns.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n   candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0   [to cover from 0 to a[0]]\n   candidate2 = (for i from 0 to n-2) (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n   candidate3 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0\n\n Then the answer would be the maximum of these three values.\n\n But wait, what if there's no lantern at the beginning? Actually, we have sorted the list and the first lantern might not be at 0.\n\n However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. The required d is at least a[0]/2.\n\n Similarly, the right end requires d at least (l - a[-1])/2.\n\n And for the gaps, the worst gap between two consecutive lanterns is (a[i+1]-a[i])/2, but actually we can also think:\n\n Consider two consecutive lanterns: the entire segment they cover is from (a[i] - d) to (a[i+1] + d). But to cover the gap between a[i] and a[i+1], we require that the interval from a[i] to a[i+1] is contained in [a[i]-d, a[i+1]+d]. This is automatically satisfied if d is at least (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 because then the midpoint is (a[i]+a[i+1])/2, and the left lantern must cover up to a[i] + d, which must be at least (a[i]+a[i+1])/2, so d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n However, note that if we set d to the maximum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3, then:\n\n   Left part: the first lantern at a[0] will cover from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. Since d>=a[0]/2, we have a[0]-d <= 0, so the left part is covered.\n\n   Between two consecutive lanterns: the left lantern covers up to a[i] + d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1] - d. We need a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d? Actually, we require that the entire gap is covered, meaning that the coverage from the left lantern must extend at least to the right lantern or beyond the gap. The condition is: a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d? That would imply 2*d >= a[i+1] - a[i]. So yes, d must be at least (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Right part: the last lantern at a[-1] must cover l: a[-1] + d >= l -> d >= (l - a[-1])\n\n But wait, we have two different conditions for the left and right: \n   Left: d >= a[0]/2\n   Right: d >= (l - a[-1])/2\n\n However, note that the above conditions are exactly the same as the others: (a[0]/2) is the requirement for the left, and (l - a[-1])/2 is the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point 0 to point `l`. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for all lantern positions `a_i`. The solution involves checking three main segments:\n   - **Left Segment (0 to the first lantern)**: The first lantern must extend its light far enough to cover the start of the street (0). The required `d` here is `a[0]/2`.\n   - **Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be fully covered. The required `d` here is half the distance between the two closest lanterns.\n   - **Right Segment (last lantern to l)**: The last lantern must extend its light far enough to cover the end of the street (`l`). The required `d` here is `(l - a[-1])/2`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: After sorting the lantern positions, we compute the maximum value among the three segments mentioned above. This maximum value ensures that all parts of the street are adequately covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent steps involve linear scans through the sorted list, which is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    a = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidates = []\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(l/2)\n        return\n        \n    left_gap = a[0] / 2.0\n    right_gap = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0\n    \n    candidates.append(left_gap)\n    candidates.append(right_gap)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        needed = gap / 2.0\n        candidates.append(needed)\n        \n    result = max(candidates)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate checking the leftmost and rightmost segments and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Checking Segments**: \n   - **Left Segment**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern is `a[0]`, so the required `d` is `a[0]/2`.\n   - **Right Segment**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`) is `l - a[-1]`, so the required `d` is `(l - a[-1])/2`.\n   - **Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is `a[i] - a[i-1]`, and the required `d` to cover this gap is half of this distance.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all these computed values ensures that every segment of the street is illuminated. This maximum value is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all critical segments of the street to determine the minimal `d` required for full illumination.",
