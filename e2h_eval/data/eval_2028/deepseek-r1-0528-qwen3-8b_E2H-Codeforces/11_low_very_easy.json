A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Then, the maximum number of toasts that can be made from the drink is: total_drink // (nl * n) \n    But wait: actually, each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend? \n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n This means: for one toast, we need:\n   - Drink: n * nl (because there are n friends, each requiring nl milliliters)\n   - Lime: 1 slice (per toast, and each toast is for one friend, but note: they are making toasts for all friends simultaneously? Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ...\", so for each toast, each friend must have their own portion. Therefore, one toast (one round of toasting) requires for all friends: n * nl milliliters and n * (1) slices of lime? \n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n Explanation: \n   Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters. They need 3*3=9 ml per toast (if 3 friends and each needs 3 ml) -> but wait, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n But note: the example says \"nl\" is 3 (from the input: the last two numbers are nl and np, which are 3 and 1). So for one toast, each friend needs 3 ml. Since there are 3 friends, the drink requirement per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml? \n\n However, the example does: 20 / 3 (which is 6 toasts) and then divides by 3 again (because there are 3 friends) to get 2. \n\n Wait, let me clarify the example:\n\n   Input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters (3 ml) of the drink, a slice of lime and np (1 gram) of salt\" for one toast.\n\n   But note: the toasts are being made by the group. One toast means one round where every friend drinks one toast. Therefore, for one complete round (one toast per friend), we need:\n      - Drink: 3 * 3 = 9 ml\n      - Lime: 3 * 1 = 3 slices\n      - Salt: 3 * 1 = 3 grams\n\n   However, the example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   This calculation seems to consider that one toast (by one friend) requires 3 ml. Then total toasts (across all friends) would be limited by drink: floor(20 / 3) = 6.\n\n   But wait: if we have 3 friends, then we cannot have 6 toasts because one toast is defined as one round for all friends? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\" and \"provided they all drink the same amount\".\n\n   The key: they are making multiple rounds (each round is one toast per friend). In one round, each friend makes one toast, so the entire group uses n * nl ml of drink, and n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt.\n\n   But note: the example calculation:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (n * nl) = 20 / (3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, then divide by the number of friends to ensure everyone drinks the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can partake in based on the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt for each friend.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution hinges on determining the maximum number of toasts possible from each resource (drink, limes, salt) and then finding the minimum among these values. This minimum value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend can make the same number of toasts.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Calculating the total drink available (k * l).\n   - Calculating the total lime slices available (c * d).\n   - Using these totals to find the maximum toasts possible from each resource.\n   - The drink requirement per toast for all friends combined is (n * nl), so the number of toasts from drink is (total_drink // (n * nl)).\n   - Similarly, the lime slices required per toast for all friends is n, so the number of toasts from limes is (total_lime_slices // n).\n   - The salt requirement per toast for all friends is (n * np), so the number of toasts from salt is (p // (n * np)).\n4. **Edge Cases**: If any of the resources are insufficient, the result will be zero. The solution efficiently checks all three resources to determine the limiting factor.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl) if n * nl != 0 else 0\n    toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n if n != 0 else 0\n    toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np) if n * np != 0 else 0\n    \n    min_toasts = min(toasts_by_drink, toasts_by_lime, toasts_by_salt)\n    \n    print(min_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast per friend, and salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Calculating Totals**: The total drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. The total lime slices are calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n3. **Determining Toasts per Resource**: \n   - **Drink**: The number of toasts that can be made from the drink is the total drink divided by the product of the number of friends and the drink per toast per friend.\n   - **Limes**: The number of toasts that can be made from the limes is the total lime slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt**: The number of toasts that can be made from the salt is the total salt divided by the product of the number of friends and the salt per toast per friend.\n4. **Finding the Minimum Toasts**: The smallest value among the toasts calculated from each resource determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all resource constraints to ensure the solution is both correct and optimal.",
