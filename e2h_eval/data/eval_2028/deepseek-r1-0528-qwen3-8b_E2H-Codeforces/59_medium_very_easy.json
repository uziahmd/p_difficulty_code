    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of arrays [S1, S2, ..., SN] (each Si is a subset of {1,2,...,K}) such that there exists a permutation of the array for which:\n   S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for each i from 1 to N-1.\n\nRecall: A set A is a child of set B if for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nLet's break down the condition:\n\nSuppose we have a chain S'_1, S'_2, ... , S'_N. Then we require:\n   For every element x in S'_1, x+1 must be in S'_2.\n   For every element x in S'_2, x+1 must be in S'_3.\n   ...\n\nNote: The sets are subsets of [1, K]. Also, note that the same integer might appear multiple times? But the sets only contain distinct integers (by definition). So we are dealing with sets.\n\nWe can think of the entire chain as being determined by the first set and then the condition propagates. However, note that the problem allows rearranging the array arbitrarily. This means we are allowed to assign the sets arbitrarily to the N positions, but the condition must hold for some cyclic ordering? Actually, the condition is for consecutive sets in the array (after rearrangement) so we have a linear chain.\n\nBut note: the condition does not require that the chain is closed. We have exactly N sets and we need a chain of length N (so the last set doesn't have to satisfy the condition for a next set? Actually, the condition is for each i from 1 to N-1, so the last set (S'_N) has no requirement for a next set.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"There exists a way to rearrange the array of sets into [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] such that S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for each 1<=i<=N-1.\"\n\nSo we have a sequence of N sets (the rearranged array) and the condition must hold between consecutive sets.\n\nHow to approach?\n\nWe can consider the following:\n\n1. Each set is a subset of [1, K]. The total number of sets is 2^K, which is too many.\n\n2. Instead, note that the condition defines a dependency between sets. We can model the sets as states and the condition as transitions.\n\nBut note: the condition is defined in terms of the immediate successor. Specifically, if we have set A, then the next set B must contain all the numbers x+1 for every x in A.\n\nMoreover, note that the condition is one-way: from A to B, we require that for each x in A, x+1 is in B. There is no condition on the elements of B that are not in A+1.\n\nBut also note: the same set may appear multiple times, and the sets can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So we are essentially looking for a multiset of N sets (with repetition allowed) that can be arranged in a sequence such that each set (except the last) is a child of the next.\n\nBut note: the array is ordered and two arrays are different if at any index the set is different. However, we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. This means that the condition is independent of the order of the sets? Actually, no: the condition requires a specific order.\n\nBut note: we can choose any order. So we are counting the number of multisets of size N (each element is a subset) that can be arranged in a sequence satisfying the child condition.\n\nWait, but note: the problem says \"arrays\" and \"rearranging\", so we are counting sequences (order matters) but we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. However, the problem asks for the number of different arrays (so the original order of the sets is fixed, but we can rearrange arbitrarily to satisfy the condition). \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"There exists a way to rearrange the array of sets into [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] such that ...\"\n\nSo we are counting arrays (of N sets) that can be rearranged to form a chain. However, note that the array itself is a fixed multiset of sets. Then we are counting multisets of size N (from the 2^K sets) that can be arranged in a chain. But note: the same multiset might be arranged in multiple orders, but the condition is about the existence of at least one arrangement.\n\nBut wait: the problem does not require counting distinct multisets. It counts arrays (so the original order doesn't matter for the condition, but the multiset of sets is what matters). However, note: the array is defined by the sequence of sets. And two arrays are different if at any index the set is different. But we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So we are effectively counting the number of multisets (with order not fixed) that can be arranged in a chain, but then multiplied by the number of permutations of that multiset that actually form a chain? \n\nActually, no: the problem says \"different arrays\" meaning that the array is an ordered list. But then we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily to satisfy the condition. So we are counting the number of arrays (ordered) that can be rearranged to form a chain. However, note: if we have two arrays that are permutations of each other, then either both can be rearranged to form a chain or none. But the condition is about the multiset of sets.\n\nBut wait: the problem does not require the same multiset to have only one valid arrangement. Actually, the condition is: there exists one arrangement (order) that satisfies the chain condition.\n\nSo the problem is: Count the number of sequences (arrays) (S_1, S_2, ..., S_N) (each S_i is a subset) such that the multiset {S_1, S_2, ..., S_N} can be arranged in a chain.\n\nBut note: two different sequences (arrays) that are permutations of each other are considered different. However, we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So the condition is: the multiset must be chainable.\n\nBut then, how do we count?\n\nAlternative view:\n\nConsider building a directed graph where nodes are subsets of [1, K] and an edge from A to B exists if A is a child of B (i.e., for every x in A, x+1 is in B). Then we want to count the number of multisets of N nodes (with repetition) that can be arranged in a directed path of length N-1 (so a walk of N nodes).\n\nBut note: the graph has 2^K nodes, which is too many.\n\nWe need a combinatorial or dynamic programming solution.\n\nLet's try to simplify:\n\nWhat are the necessary conditions for a set to be used?\n\nNote: The chain condition implies that if we have a set A, then the next set must contain all the numbers that are x+1 for every x in A. Also, the previous set must have been a child of A, meaning that for every x in the previous set, x+1 is in A.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use the same set multiple times? Yes, because the array can have repeated sets.\n\nAnother observation: The condition does not require that the sets are distinct. So we can have repeated sets.\n\nNow, note that the condition propagates: if we have a set A, then the next set must include all the numbers that are one more than the numbers in A. But note: the numbers are from 1 to K.\n\nAlso, the sets are built from {1,...,K}. Let us define:\n\nLet f(n, S) be the number of chains of n sets ending with set S. Then we would have:\n   f(1, S) = 1 for every set S.\n   f(i, S) = sum_{T: T is a child of S} f(i-1, T)\n\nBut then we have to sum over all starting sets and then for n=N? However, the chain condition is: the entire array must be rearrangeable to a chain. But note: the problem allows any rearrangement. However, we are counting the arrays (multisets) that can be arranged in a chain.\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix the starting point. We are allowed to choose the order arbitrarily. Therefore, we are counting the multisets (with N sets) that can be arranged in a chain.\n\nThis is equivalent to: the multiset must have a linear arrangement (a Hamiltonian path in the directed graph of sets) but we don't know the graph structure.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the idea of state compression and dynamic programming over the \"state\" of the chain.\n\nBut note: the condition is very local: the next set must contain all the numbers that are one more than the current set.\n\nLet's consider the minimal sets we can use.\n\nObservation: Since the condition requires that if a set contains x, then the next set must contain x+1, we can think of the sets as being built from a base set and then shifting by one. However, note that the chain can start at any set.\n\nBut note: the sets are arbitrary. However, we can characterize a set by the presence/absence of consecutive numbers? \n\nAnother idea: Consider the numbers from 1 to K. For the chain condition to hold, we must have:\n\nIf we let M be the maximum number that appears in any set, then the chain must extend until at least M+1 (if we require the next set to contain M+1) but note: the chain ends at the last set, so the last set doesn't need to have a next set.\n\nBut also, we can have gaps.\n\nHowever, note: the condition is only about the immediate successor.\n\nWe can also note that the condition is independent for each \"component\" of consecutive numbers? Actually, no: because the sets are arbitrary, but the condition couples adjacent numbers.\n\nBut we can try to model the set by its \"closure\" under the operation x -> x+1. However, we are only concerned with the immediate next set.\n\nLet's define:\n\nLet F(S) be the set of numbers that must be present in the next set: it is the set {x+1 : x in S}. Then for the chain, if we have a set S, the next set T must contain F(S).\n\nMoreover, the previous set must have been a set U such that F(U) âŠ† T (but we don't require that, actually the condition is only for the immediate predecessor: the condition for the edge from U to T is that for every x in U, x+1 is in T. But note: the condition for the chain is only from the immediate predecessor to the current set, not the reverse.\n\nBut note: the condition is only one direction: from the current set to the next.\n\nWe can define a directed graph on the power set of [K] as follows:\n   Node: a subset S âŠ† {1,...,K}\n   Edge: from S to T if and only if T âŠ‡ {x+1 : x âˆˆ S}\n\nBut the number of nodes is 2^K, which is too large.\n\nWe need to find a combinatorial invariant or a simpler representation.\n\nLet us consider the following:\n\nIn the entire chain, we have N sets. The condition requires that if we traverse the chain, then for each occurrence of a number x in a set, then the next set must contain x+1. But note that the same set might appear multiple times.\n\nBut note: we can also think of the sets as being labeled by their \"support\" for the numbers. However, the condition links consecutive sets.\n\nAnother idea: The condition is similar to a state machine where the state is the set of numbers that must be accounted for in the next set.\n\nBut note: the condition for the entire chain is that the sets must form a sequence where each set forces the next set to include certain numbers.\n\nLet us consider the following: What are the minimal sets that can be used?\n\nDefine a set S by the maximal consecutive numbers it contains? Actually, we can represent a set by the leftmost and rightmost consecutive numbers? But note: the set might not be contiguous.\n\nHowever, we can define a set by the \"gaps\" in the numbers. But note: the condition only requires that if x is present then x+1 must be in the next set.\n\nBut here's a key observation: the entire chain condition is equivalent to the following:\n\nLet the entire multiset of sets be M. Then we must be able to arrange them in an order such that for each set except the last, the set S_i forces that the next set contains all the numbers x+1 for every x in S_i.\n\nBut note: the same set might appear multiple times. Then we have to account for the dependencies.\n\nWe can also think of the sets as being characterized by the largest number they contain. Let m(S) = max(S) if S is nonempty, and m(S) = -infty for empty set.\n\nThen the condition for the chain: if we have a set S with maximum m, then the next set must contain m+1. Then the next set must have maximum at least m+1.\n\nBut note: the next set might have numbers beyond m+1, and might also have numbers less than m+1. However, the condition only forces the presence of m+1.\n\nBut then, the chain must end at a set that does not require a next set, but the condition for the next set is independent of the maximum.\n\nMoreover, we can have multiple sets with the same maximum.\n\nHowever, note: the condition does not require that the maximum increases by one each time. It only requires that if a set contains x, then the next set contains x+1. So if a set contains two numbers, say 2 and 3, then the next set must contain 3 and 4.\n\nBut then the maximum of the next set must be at least 4.\n\nSo the maximum of the sets must be non-decreasing? Actually, the maximum of the chain must be increasing: if we have a set with maximum m, then the next set must contain m+1, so its maximum is at least m+1.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain must have sets whose maximums are non-decreasing? Actually, strictly increasing until the last set.\n\nBut wait: the last set does not require a next set, so the chain condition only applies for the first N-1 sets.\n\nThus, the condition on the chain is that the maximums must be strictly increasing until the last set, and the last set can have a maximum that is the same as the previous? Actually, no: if the previous set has maximum m, then the last set must have at least m+1 (if it is not the last set) but wait, the condition applies only for the edges. The last set has no outgoing edge condition, but the second last set must force the last set to have at least (max of second last)+1.\n\nBut note: the sets are arbitrary. The condition for the second last set is: for every x in the second last set, x+1 is in the last set. In particular, if the second last set has maximum m, then the last set must contain m+1.\n\nTherefore, the maximums of the sets must form a strictly increasing sequence? Not necessarily: because a set might have multiple numbers and the maximum might be achieved by several sets, but the condition forces the next set to have a maximum at least one more than the current set's maximum.\n\nBut note: the condition is on each element. If the second last set has maximum m, then the last set must have m+1. However, the second last set might have a maximum less than m, and then the last set must have at least (max of second last)+1, which could be greater than m+1.\n\nActually, the entire chain must have the property that the set of numbers that appear (across the entire chain) must be connected in the sense of consecutive numbers? Not necessarily: we can jump from a low number to a high number.\n\nBut the condition is local. \n\nHowever, let us consider the following: we can assign to each set a \"signature\": the set of numbers that are the smallest number in the set? Or the set of \"required\" numbers for the next set.\n\nBut note: the condition for a set S is that the next set must contain {x+1 | x in S}. We can think of the set S as requiring the next set to have a superset of T0 = {x+1 | x in S}. \n\nNow, note: the condition for the entire chain is independent for each \"chain\" of numbers? Actually, no, because a set can contain multiple numbers.\n\nBut we can break the problem by considering the numbers independently? \n\nWait, note: the condition for a set S is that the next set must contain all the numbers x+1 for every x in S. This is equivalent to: the next set must contain the set T0. But note that the same set S might be broken down by the numbers it contains.\n\nHowever, we can consider the following: the entire process is driven by the numbers from 1 to K. Each number x (from 1 to K) can be thought of as a token that must be \"passed\" to the next set (as x+1) when it appears.\n\nBut note: the sets are arbitrary, and we can have a set that contains multiple tokens.\n\nWe can define a state for the entire chain by the set of numbers that are \"active\" in the current set. But that is too complex.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nConsider that the condition is very similar to a sequence of sets that are \"compatible\" in the following way: the set S_i must be contained in the set obtained by taking the set S_{i+1} and removing the highest element and then shifting down by one? Actually, no: the condition is the opposite.\n\nActually, the condition is: S_i âŠ† {x-1 | x in S_{i+1}}? No, because the condition is: for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. So S_i âŠ† {x-1 | x in S_{i+1}} is not the same: that would require that if x is in S_i then x-1 is in S_{i+1}. \n\nBut wait: the condition is: for each x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. So we can write: S_i âŠ† {x-1 | x in S_{i+1}} is not correct. Actually, we have {x | x+1 in S_{i+1}} contains S_i. \n\nLet T_{i+1} = {x-1 | x in S_{i+1}}. Then the condition is S_i âŠ† T_{i+1}.\n\nBut note: T_{i+1} is just a shift of S_{i+1} by subtracting one. But then the condition becomes: the set S_i must be contained in the shifted version of S_{i+1}. \n\nBut then, we can define for each set S, a set T = {x-1 | x in S and x>1} (and we can define that for x=1, x-1=0 which we ignore). Then the condition is: S_i âŠ† T_{i+1}.\n\nBut then, the entire chain condition becomes: \n   S_1 âŠ† T_2, S_2 âŠ† T_3, ... , S_{N-1} âŠ† T_N.\n\nBut note: T_{i} is the set obtained by shifting S_i by -1 (and ignoring zeros). \n\nNow, we can define a transformation on sets: \n   Let g(S) = {x-1 | x in S, x>=2} âˆª { } (for x=1, we remove it and don't add anything).\n\nThen the condition is: S_i âŠ† g(S_{i+1]).\n\nBut note: this transformation is idempotent? And we can iterate it.\n\nMoreover, note that the transformation g shifts the set down by one and truncates at 0. Then we can consider the sets modulo this transformation.\n\nBut then, we can define an equivalence relation: two sets are equivalent if they transform to the same set after applying g repeatedly until no change? Actually, we can keep applying g until we get the empty set.\n\nBut note: the condition is: S_i must be contained in g(S_{i+1]). This is a containment condition.\n\nNow, consider the entire chain: \n   S_1 âŠ† g(S_2)\n   S_2 âŠ† g(S_3)\n   ...\n   S_{N-1} âŠ† g(S_N)\n\nBy transitivity: S_1 âŠ† g(S_2) âŠ† g^2(S_3) âŠ† ... âŠ† g^{N-1}(S_N)\n\nBut note: the sets are finite and the transformation g eventually leads to the empty set.\n\nBut we are allowed to use any sets. How do we count the multisets of N sets that can be arranged in a chain satisfying the above?\n\nBut note: the condition is for the entire chain, but the sets are chosen arbitrarily.\n\nWe can try to use DP by the \"level\" of the sets. But note: the sets are defined on [1, K], and the transformation g reduces the numbers by one (and removes zeros).\n\nDefine for a set S, let L(S) be the minimum element of S (if S is nonempty) or 0 (or infinity) for empty set? Actually, we don't care about the minimum.\n\nBut note: the condition S_i âŠ† g(S_{i+1]) implies that if S_i contains x, then S_{i+1] must contain x+1. This forces that the sets must be \"connected\" by the transformation.\n\nHowever, there is a known combinatorial structure: the sets can be represented by their characteristic vector and the transformation g is linear? \n\nBut note: we can also think of the sets as independent sets in a path graph? \n\nWait, here's a different approach:\n\nWe can consider the entire chain condition as a system of inclusions. However, note that the sets are arbitrary and the condition is very weak.\n\nBut note: the transformation g(S) = {x-1 | x in S and x>=2} is a retraction from the set of subsets to the set of subsets of {1,...,K-1}. Then we can define a potential function on sets.\n\nBut we are allowed to use any sets, and the chain condition is: S_1 âŠ† g(S_2), S_2 âŠ† g(S_3), ... \n\nWe can consider the sets in decreasing order of their \"strength\" (i.e., the numbers they contain). The strongest sets are the ones that contain large numbers.\n\nBut note: the condition is: the set S_i must be contained in g(S_{i+1]), so S_{i+1] must contain all the numbers that are one more than those in S_i. \n\nWe can also consider the following: the entire chain must cover a set of numbers from 1 to some maximum, but the sets are arbitrary.\n\nBut wait, we can break the problem by the numbers from 1 to K. Each number x can be thought of as a requirement that if we use x in a set, then the next set must contain x+1.\n\nBut note: the same set can be used multiple times, and the same number can appear in multiple sets.\n\nHowever, the condition for the entire chain is: the sets must be arranged so that the numbers 1,2,...,K appear in a non-decreasing order (actually increasing) in the following sense: whenever we see a number x, then the next set must contain x+1.\n\nBut note: the same set might appear twice, and that set might contain several numbers.\n\nWe can define a state for each number x (from 1 to K) that records whether x is \"active\" in the current set. But note: the condition is global: the entire set must be contained in the next set shifted.\n\nBut we can also consider the following: the minimal requirement for the chain is that the sets must be \"compatible\" with a non-decreasing sequence of thresholds.\n\nAfter careful thought, note that the condition is very similar to the following: the entire chain must be able to be broken down by the numbers. In fact, we can assign to each set a \"type\" by the minimal number that forces a break. \n\nBut there is a known result: the number of chains of sets (without repetition) in this graph was studied in a similar problem.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: N, K up to 200000.\n\nWe need an efficient solution.\n\nLet's try to count the number of chains of length N (the multiset must be chainable) by decomposing the problem.\n\nObservation:\n\nThe condition for the chain is: there exists a permutation (S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N) such that S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nThis is equivalent to: the multiset of sets must be such that the sets can be topologically sorted according to the partial order: A <= B if A is a child of B (i.e., A âŠ† g(B)). But note: the graph is not a partial order (it's a directed graph) and cycles might exist? Actually, if we have two sets A and B such that A is a child of B and B is a child of A, then we have a cycle. However, the condition for a cycle: \n   A âŠ† g(B) and B âŠ† g(A).\n\nBut g(A) = {x-1 | x in A, x>=2}. Then B âŠ† g(A) => for every x in B, x-1 is in A (if x>=2) or if x=1 then nothing? Actually, the definition of g(A) does not include 1 if we shift 2->1, but if we have x=1 in B, then the condition for the edge from B to A requires that for every y in B, y+1 is in A. But if y=1, then 2 must be in A. Similarly, from A to B: for every y in A, y+1 is in B. \n\nExample: A = {2}, B = {1}. Then:\n   From A to B: requires that 2+1=3 is in B -> but B={1} doesn't have 3 -> fails.\n   From B to A: requires that 1+1=2 is in A -> yes, so edge from B to A exists.\n\nBut the edge from A to B does not exist. So there is no cycle between {2} and {1}.\n\nBut consider A = {1,2} and B = {2}. \n   From A to B: requires 1+1=2 and 2+1=3 -> B must contain 2 and 3 -> but B={2} does not contain 3 -> fails.\n   From B to A: requires 2+1=3 in A -> A={1,2} does not contain 3 -> fails.\n\nSo no edge either way.\n\nBut consider A = {2} and B = {2}. Then:\n   From A to B: requires 3 in B -> fails.\n   From B to A: requires 3 in A -> fails.\n\nSo no edge.\n\nBut consider A = {1} and B = {2}: \n   From A to B: requires 2 in B -> yes.\n   From B to A: requires 3 in A -> no.\n\nSo only one direction.\n\nTherefore, the graph is acyclic? Not necessarily: consider a set A that contains {2,3} and a set B that contains {3,4}. Then from A to B: requires 3 and 4 -> B contains 3 and 4 -> okay. From B to A: requires 4 and 5 -> A does not contain 5 -> fails.\n\nBut consider a set A containing {1,2} and a set B containing {2,3}. Then:\n   A to B: requires 2 and 3 -> B contains 2 and 3 -> okay.\n   B to A: requires 3 and 4 -> A does not contain 4 -> fails.\n\nSo no cycle.\n\nBut can we have a cycle? \n   Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,3,4}. Then:\n      A to B: requires 2,3,4 -> B has 2,3,4 -> okay.\n      B to A: requires 3,4,5 -> A does not have 5 -> fails.\n\nIt seems difficult to have a cycle.\n\nIn fact, the condition for an edge from A to B is that B must contain {x+1 | x in A}. Then for a cycle, we would require that A contains {x+1 | x in B} and B contains {x+1 | x in A}. Then by induction, A would contain {x+2 | x in A} and so on, until we leave the range [1,K]. But since K is finite, this cannot happen (unless the sets are empty or something). \n\nActually, the empty set: \n   Let A = {}, then condition for edge to B: {} is contained in g(B) (which is always true). So the empty set has edges to every set.\n   But then, from a set B to the empty set: we require that for every x in B, x+1 is in the empty set -> only if B is empty. So the empty set only has an edge to every set, and only the empty set has an edge to the empty set.\n\nSo the empty set is a sink? Actually, no: the empty set can receive an edge from every set (because if B is any set, then the condition for the edge from B to the empty set is that for every x in B, x+1 is in the empty set -> which requires B to be empty). So the empty set has incoming edges only from the empty set.\n\nBut then, the graph is acyclic? \n\nActually, we can have a cycle only if there is a set A such that A = g(A) and then we can have self-loops. But g(A) = {x-1 | x in A, x>=2}. For example, if A = {1}, then g(A)= {} -> not equal. If A = {2}, then g(A) = {1}. Then {2} -> {1} -> {} -> {} (and then stuck). \n\nBut consider A = {2,3}: g(A) = {1,2}. Then from A to {1,2}: \n   Condition: for every x in {2,3}: 3 is not in {1,2} -> fails.\n\nWait, so {2,3} does not have an edge to {1,2} because 3+1=4 is not in {1,2}. \n\nBut {1,2} has an edge to {0,1}? But 0 is not allowed. So g({1,2}) = {0,1} âˆ© [1,K] = {1} (if we define g to map to [1,K] by dropping zeros). Actually, we defined g(S) = {x-1 | x in S and x>=2}. So for {1,2}: \n   x=1: skip, x=2: 2-1=1 -> so g({1,2}) = {1}. Then {1} maps to {}.\n\nSo the graph has no cycles (except possibly the empty set, but even then: the empty set has a self-loop? \n   Condition for empty set to empty set: for every x in empty set, x+1 is in empty set -> vacuously true. So the empty set has a self-loop.\n\nBut wait: the condition for the edge from empty set to empty set is satisfied, so there is a self-loop on the empty set.\n\nBut then, the graph has cycles (the empty set has a self-loop). \n\nHowever, note that the problem allows rearranging arbitrarily. So we can use the empty set multiple times, but then the condition for the empty set to any set is always true (because the empty set has no elements) and the condition from a non-empty set to the empty set is only true if the non-empty set is empty (which it isn't). \n\nBut wait, the condition for an edge from a non-empty set A to the empty set: for every x in A, x+1 must be in the empty set -> which is false unless A is empty. \n\nSo the empty set is a special node.\n\nBut note: the condition for the entire chain is: we have N sets. We can use the empty set arbitrarily many times, but note that if we use a non-empty set, then the next set must contain the shifted set. And if we use the empty set, then the next set can be arbitrary.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of arrays (sequences) of N sets (each set is a subset of [1,K]) such that the multiset can be rearranged to form a chain.\n\nSince the empty set is a sink (you cannot leave the empty set to a non-empty set? Actually, from the empty set you can go to any set (including non-empty) because the empty set has no elements. But from a non-empty set you cannot go to the empty set.\n\nSo the empty set can appear anywhere in the chain? But then, the condition for the entire chain is that we can arrange the sets so that every non-empty set is followed by a set that contains the shifted version.\n\nBut note: if we have a non-empty set, then the next set must contain the shifted set. And the shifted set is non-empty (unless the set was {1} then shifted is {}). But then, if we have a set {1}, the next set must contain {2}. \n\nBut the empty set can be placed arbitrarily? Actually, the empty set can be placed at the beginning or at the end, but not in the middle if there is a non-empty set before and after? \n\nWait, consider: \n   [ {1}, {}, {2} ] \n   Condition: \n        {1} must be a child of {} -> fails because {} does not contain 2.\n        {1} must be a child of {2} -> succeeds.\n\nBut we can rearrange the array arbitrarily. So the condition is: there exists an order. \n\nIn the above example, the multiset is {{1}, {}, {2}}. We can arrange it as [ {1}, {2}, {} ]: \n   {1} is a child of {2} -> yes (because {2} contains 2 = 1+1).\n   {2} is a child of {} -> no ({} does not contain 3).\n\nOr [ {2}, {1}, {} ]: \n   {2} is a child of {1} -> fails (1 does not contain 3).\n\nOr [ {}, {1}, {2} ]: \n   {} is a child of {1} -> yes (vacuously).\n   {1} is a child of {2} -> yes.\n\nSo the multiset {{1}, {}, {2}} can be arranged as [ {}, {1}, {2} ] and satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the empty set can be used to \"start\" the chain, and then we can have non-empty sets that are children of the next.\n\nBut note: the chain condition only requires the immediate next set to contain the shifted set. The empty set can be placed anywhere as long as the non-empty sets are arranged in increasing order (by their transformed sets).\n\nBut note: the condition for non-empty sets is that the next set must contain the shifted set. \n\nNow, we can consider the following: \n\nEach non-empty set S can be transformed by g until it becomes empty. The number of transformations needed for S to become empty is the maximum element in S plus one? Not exactly, but we can define the \"length\" of a set S as the maximum element in S (or the maximum element that appears in the chain of transformations). \n\nBut note: the condition for the entire chain is that the sets must be arranged so that the transformed set of each set is contained in the next set.\n\nBut then, we can define a total order on the sets by comparing their \"transformed versions\". However, the sets are not totally ordered.\n\nBut note: the empty set is the only set that is contained in every set (since the condition for an edge from any set to the empty set fails, but the condition for an edge from the empty set to any set holds). \n\nActually, the empty set is the only set that is a child of every set (wait, no: the condition for a set A to be a child of set B is that for every x in A, x+1 is in B. But if A is non-empty, then B must contain the shifted set. The empty set is a child of every set because it has no elements). \n\nTherefore, the empty set can be inserted anywhere in the chain, but the non-empty sets must be arranged in an order that respects the following: if A and B are non-empty, then if A is a child of B, then A can appear before B.\n\nBut then, the non-empty sets form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (since we saw no cycles) and the empty set can be used as a \"filler\" to connect components.\n\nBut then, the problem reduces to: count the number of multisets of N sets (each set is a subset of [1,K]) such that the non-empty sets (ignoring the empty set) form a chain (possibly with repetitions) in the DAG defined by the edge A->B if A is a child of B, and the empty set can appear arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: the empty set can appear arbitrarily, and the non-empty sets must form a chain (possibly with repetitions) but the chain condition is only for the non-empty part? Actually, no: the entire multiset must be arranged in a chain. The empty set can be placed anywhere, but the non-empty sets must form a subsequence that is a chain.\n\nMoreover, the empty set can be used to \"reset\" the chain? Actually, no: because the empty set has no elements, so the next set can be any set. But the condition for the set after the empty set is: it",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of different arrays of N sets (each set being a subset of integers from 1 to K) such that there exists a rearrangement of the array where each set is a \"child\" of the next set in the sequence. A set A is defined as a child of set B if for every element x in A, the element x+1 is present in B.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the condition for a set A to be a child of set B requires that B must contain all elements x+1 for every x in A. This creates a dependency between consecutive sets in the rearranged array. The empty set can be considered a child of any set because it has no elements, thus satisfying the condition vacuously.\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem can be broken down into considering the empty set and non-empty sets separately. The empty set can be used flexibly in the sequence, while non-empty sets must form a chain where each set's elements are mapped to their successors in the next set. \n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences. The DP state `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a sequence of length `i` ending with a set that has its maximum element at position `j`. \n\n4. **Transition**: For each set, the next set must include all elements x+1 for every x in the current set. The transition involves shifting elements down by one and ensuring the next set contains these shifted elements.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    \n    dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        new_dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n        for j in range(k + 1):\n            if dp[j] == 0:\n                continue\n            for x in range(1, k + 1):\n                if j < x:\n                    new_dp[x] = (new_dp[x] + dp[j]) % mod\n            new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + dp[j]) % mod\n        dp = new_dp\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % mod\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` because the empty set (represented by 0) has one way to be included in any sequence.\n\n2. **DP Transition**: For each subsequent set in the sequence (from 1 to N-1), we compute a new DP array `new_dp`. For each possible maximum element `j` in the current set, we consider all possible shifts (elements `x` from 1 to K). If `j < x`, it means the next set can have a maximum element `x` by including `x` (since `x` is greater than the current maximum `j`). The count is updated accordingly.\n\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all N sets, the total number of valid sequences is the sum of all entries in the final DP array, taken modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming to handle the dependencies between sets, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of N and K.",
