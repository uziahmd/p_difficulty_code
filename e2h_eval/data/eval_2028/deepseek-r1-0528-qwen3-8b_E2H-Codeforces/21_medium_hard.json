The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (odd/even) of the numbers because the condition is about the sum being odd.\n Condition: a_i + b_j is odd  <=> one is even and the other is odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes: \n        Even_chest: a_i even\n        Odd_chest: a_i odd\n\n   Keys:\n        Even_key: b_j even\n        Odd_key: b_j odd\n\n Now, note that an even chest can be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n        an odd chest can be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n But note: we cannot use a key twice.\n\n So the problem reduces to: \n   We have two types of chests (even and odd) and two types of keys (even and odd).\n\n   We can form two bipartite graphs:\n        Graph 1: even_chests can be matched with odd_keys.\n        Graph 2: odd_chests can be matched with even_keys.\n\n However, note that the same key type might appear multiple times. We are not limited by the total number of keys but by the matching.\n\n But wait: the condition for matching is fixed by parity. We don't care about the actual numbers beyond their parity.\n\n However, we must also consider: what if we run out of keys of a particular type? \n\n Actually, the maximum matching in bipartite graphs for two independent sets is just the minimum between the available keys and chests for each pair?\n\n But note: the two pairs are independent. So:\n\n   Let:\n        E_c = number of even chests\n        O_c = number of odd chests\n\n        E_k = number of even keys\n        O_k = number of odd keys\n\n Then, for the even_chests, they require odd keys. The maximum we can open from even_chests is min(E_c, O_k).\n Similarly, for the odd_chests, they require even keys. The maximum we can open from odd_chests is min(O_c, E_k).\n\n However, wait: we are using keys. The same key cannot be used twice. But note that the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the total matching is the sum of the two minima?\n\n But let's think: we have two separate matchings. There is no conflict because the keys used in the first matching (odd keys) are different from the keys used in the second matching (even keys). And similarly, the chests are distinct.\n\n However, note: the entire set of keys is partitioned into even and odd. So the odd keys are exactly O_k, and the even keys are exactly E_k.\n\n Then the matching for even_chests cannot exceed O_k, and the matching for odd_chests cannot exceed E_k.\n\n But there's a catch: we are allowed to assign any odd key to an even_chest as long as we don't use the same key twice. Similarly for even keys and odd_chests.\n\n So the maximum chests we can open is:\n   min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        E_c = 3, O_c = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        E_k = 3, O_k = 1\n\n   Then: min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> matches example output.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k=1, E_k=0\n   Then: min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0\n   Then: min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: let me check with another example.\n\n Example 4: \n   Suppose we have:\n        Chests: [1,2] -> E_c=1, O_c=1\n        Keys: [2,3] -> E_k=1, O_k=1\n        Then: min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n Example 5: \n   But what if we have:\n        Chests: [1,2,3] -> E_c=1, O_c=2\n        Keys: [2,4,5] -> E_k=2, O_k=1\n        Then: min(1,1) + min(2,2) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n However, is that correct? \n        We have one even chest: requires odd key -> we have one odd key -> can open the even chest.\n        We have two odd chests: require even keys -> we have two even keys -> can open both.\n\n        So yes, total 3.\n\n But wait, what if we have overlapping requirements? Actually, the two matchings are independent because the keys used for even_chests are odd keys, and for odd_chests are even keys, and the sets of keys are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the answer is indeed the sum of the two minima.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning is based solely on the counts of even/odd. Since the condition depends only on parity, and the matching is independent for the two types, we can do:\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m\n   Read list a (n integers)\n   Read list b (m integers)\n\n   Count:\n        E_c = count of even numbers in a (i.e., x % 2 == 0)\n        O_c = n - E_c\n\n        E_k = count of even numbers in b\n        O_k = m - E_k\n\n   Answer = min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the input numbers can be large (up to 10^9) but the modulus operation is cheap and we are only doing it for n+m numbers.\n\n This solution is O(n+m) which is acceptable for n,m up to 10^5.\n\n Let's write the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This condition is satisfied when one number is even and the other is odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to matching chests and keys based on their parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and the number of even and odd keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the counts of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the result as the sum of the two minimum values derived from these counts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element in the chests and keys lists exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (even_chest) and how many have odd numbers (odd_chest). Similarly, it counts even and odd keys.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even_chest and odd_key (since even chests need odd keys) and adding it to the minimum of odd_chest and even_key (since odd chests need even keys). This gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two minimum values calculated earlier.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without explicitly checking each possible key-chest pair, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
