For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes, but the input is provided in one line with three space-separated notes.\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (from 0 to 11) for cyclic calculation. The note list: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] but wait, the problem says there are 12 notes and they are repeated cyclically.\n\n However, note that the example includes 'A', 'B', 'H' as distinct? Actually, the problem states: \"there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\". \n\n But wait: the example input includes \"A B H\", which are three distinct notes. However, note that the example output for that input is 'strange'. \n\n Let me clarify: the notes are arranged in a circle: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, then back to C.\n\n So we can map:\n   C -> 0\n   C# -> 1\n   D -> 2\n   D# -> 3\n   E -> 4\n   F -> 5\n   F# -> 6\n   G -> 7\n   G# -> 8\n   A -> 9\n   B -> 10\n   H -> 11\n\n Then the distance from note i to note j (in semitones) is (j - i) mod 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12.\n\n However, note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. \n   E is 4, C is 0: (0 - 4) mod 12 = -4 mod12 = 8 (if we take positive modulo). So we can compute the circular distance as:\n   distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n   But if negative, we can do: \n        dist = (b - a) % 12\n        If the result is negative, we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we can do:\n        dist = (b - a) % 12\n        However, the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n        Example: (0-4) % 12 gives 8, because it's the same as (12-4)=8.\n\n But note: the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest? Actually, the chord definition is about ordering the notes so that we have two consecutive intervals. The entire set must be ordered in a cyclic way? \n\n However, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major. And for minor: 3 and then 4.\n\n Since the chord is an unordered set, we need to consider all permutations (orderings) of the three notes.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Parse the input string and split into three note names.\n 2. Map each note to a number (using the mapping above).\n 3. Consider all 6 permutations of the three notes (since the chord is unordered, but the ordering matters for the condition).\n 4. For a permutation [a, b, c]:\n      Condition for major: \n          (b - a) % 12 == 4   and (c - b) % 12 == 3\n      Condition for minor:\n          (b - a) % 12 == 3   and (c - b) % 12 == 4\n\n 5. But note: the chord must be considered in the cyclic scale. However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. In our modulo system, the distance from E to C is 8, but when we order the notes, we are going to arrange them in increasing order? Or we can also arrange them in a circular way?\n\n However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\".\n\n How do we order? The musical scale is cyclic, but the ordering should be in the natural increasing order (i.e., without wrapping around). But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n   They are ordered as \"B C# F\". This is not the natural increasing order (B is 10, C# is 1, then F is 5). But we can use modulo arithmetic to compare circularly.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number from 0 to 11 based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. For example, the distance from E (4) to C (0) is (0 - 4) % 12 = 8 semitones.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes meet the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we output \"major\" or \"minor\" respectively. If no permutation meets either condition, we output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        nums = [mapping[note.strip()] for note in data]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        dist1 = (b - a) % 12\n        dist2 = (c - b) % 12\n        total_dist = (c - a) % 12\n        if dist1 == 4 and dist2 == 3 and total_dist % 12 == 7:\n            found_major = True\n        if dist1 == 3 and dist2 == 4 and total_dist % 12 == 7:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique number from 0 to 11, facilitating distance calculations.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is split into three parts, each representing a note. These notes are converted to their corresponding numbers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: All six possible permutations of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to ensure correct handling of the cyclic scale.\n4. **Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the code checks if the distances between the notes match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). The total distance from the first to the third note must be 7 semitones for both conditions.\n5. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major or minor condition, the corresponding result is printed. If no permutation meets either condition, \"strange\" is printed, indicating the chord does not fit the major or minor category. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the notes to determine the chord type, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases as specified in the problem.",
