She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open. Initially, all tabs from 1 to n are open and the cursor is at `pos`.\n\n We have two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (with boundaries defined by the current minimum and maximum unclosed tab indices, but note: as we close tabs, the boundaries change).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor or all tabs to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that we can also combine movements and closing operations. The goal is to leave only the tabs in [l, r].\n\n Observation:\n  We must close all tabs that are not in [l, r]. This means:\n    - We need to close all tabs with index < l (if any) and all tabs with index > r (if any).\n\n There are a few cases:\n\n Case 1: If the entire set of tabs is already within [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n) then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n But note: the problem says that the cursor is initially at `pos`. However, if the segment [l, r] is the entire set, then we don't need to close anything.\n\n Actually, the condition for no operation is when [l, r] covers [1, n]? Actually, note: we are leaving the segment [l, r] open, so if l==1 and r==n, then we don't need to close any tabs.\n\n However, there is another possibility: what if the initial set of tabs is exactly [l, r]? Then we don't need to close anything.\n\n But note: the input constraints say that initially there are n tabs from 1 to n, and we are leaving [l, r] (which is a contiguous segment). So if [1, n] is [l, r] then l=1 and r=n.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire set to be [l, r] to start with. We might have a subset.\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n We have two sides to close:\n   Left side: all tabs with index < l.\n   Right side: all tabs with index > r.\n\n We can perform two kinds of closing operations: \n   - Close left: this will remove all tabs to the left of the cursor (and update the left boundary to the cursor's position? Actually, the problem states: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" meaning the segment [a, i-1] (if any) is closed. Similarly, closing the right removes [i+1, b] (if any).\n\n However, note that after closing one side, the boundaries a and b change, and the movement operations are constrained by these boundaries.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to simulate every step. We are to compute the minimum seconds.\n\n Alternative approach: think about what must be done.\n\n Steps required:\n\n 1. We must eventually close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r).\n\n 2. We can either:\n    Option A: First close the left part and then the right part.\n    Option B: First close the right part and then the left part.\n    Option C: Maybe move the cursor to one end and then close, then move again?\n\n However, note that we can also do:\n\n    - Move the cursor to the left boundary (l) and then close the right part? Or wait, let me think.\n\n Actually, we have two types of closing operations: left-close and right-close.\n\n How do we close the left part? We must have the cursor at a position >= l (so that the left-close operation closes from the current left boundary (which is initially 1) up to the cursor's left). But note: we can only close from the current left boundary to the cursor's left. So to close everything to the left of l, we must have the cursor at a position >= l (so that the left-close operation will close from the current left boundary (which might be 1) to the cursor's left, which includes everything from 1 to l-1). Similarly, to close the right part, we must have the cursor at a position <= r.\n\n However, note: after closing some tabs, the boundaries change. But observe: \n\n   Operation \"close left\" sets the new left boundary to the cursor's current index (because it removes [a, i-1], so the new a becomes i). Similarly, close right sets the new right boundary to i.\n\n But note: the problem says that the boundaries are updated. However, we are allowed to move within the current boundaries.\n\n Important: The problem allows us to move the cursor to the left until the current left boundary (initially a=1) and to the right until the current right boundary (initially b=n). After closing, the boundaries change.\n\n However, we are only concerned with the final state: leaving [l, r] open.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   - If we are going to use two closing operations, then we must ensure that the first closing operation (say closing left) is done when the cursor is at least at l (so that the left-close operation closes everything from the current left boundary to l-1). Similarly, for the right-close.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We might do:\n\n   Step 1: Move the cursor to l (if needed) and then close the left part? But wait, closing the left part when the cursor is at l would close from the current left boundary to l-1. Since we haven't closed the right part yet, the current left boundary is still 1, so we can close [1, l-1] by being at l and performing a left-close.\n\n   Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at r and then do a right-close.\n\n   Alternatively, we might do:\n\n     Option 1: \n        - First, move to l (if necessary) and close the left part. Then, move to r (from l) and close the right part.\n\n     Option 2:\n        - First, move to r (if necessary) and close the right part. Then, move to l and close the left part.\n\n   But note: we might not need to do both. For example, if there's no left part (l==1) then we don't need to close left. Similarly, if there's no right part (r==n) then we don't need to close right.\n\n   However, there is a third option: maybe we can do both closing operations from the same position if we are smart? Actually, we must be at a position that is at least l to close the left part (so that the left-close operation doesn't accidentally leave some tabs above l? Actually, no: the left-close operation will close from the current left boundary (which is 1 until we close something) to the cursor's left. So if we are at a position >= l, then the left-close operation will close [1, i-1] and if i>=l, then [1, l-1] is included because i-1 >= l-1.\n\n   Similarly, to close the right part we must be at a position <= r.\n\n   Therefore, we must be at a position in [l, r] to close both? Actually, we can break it down:\n\n   - To close the left part, we must be at a position i such that i >= l. Then, the left-close operation will close [current_left, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] because i-1 >= l-1.\n\n   - To close the right part, we must be at a position j such that j <= r. Then, the right-close operation will close [j+1, current_right] which includes [r+1, n] because j+1 <= r+1.\n\n   However, note: we can also move the cursor arbitrarily (as long as we stay within the current boundaries) and we can interleave moves and closes.\n\n   But note: after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes the cursor's position (the one we used for the left-close). Similarly for the right.\n\n   Let's consider the minimal steps:\n\n   We have two independent parts: left and right.\n\n   Steps for closing the left part (if needed):\n\n     - If we are not already at a position >= l, we must move to at least l. But note: we might not need to go all the way to l if we are already beyond l? Actually, the cursor starts at `pos`. \n\n     However, we can also consider: maybe we can close the left part without moving if the cursor is already >= l? Then we just do one left-close.\n\n     Similarly, for the right part.\n\n   But wait: what if we are at a position that is less than l? Then we cannot close the left part from that position because the left-close operation would close from the current left boundary (which is 1) to the cursor's left (which is < l) and that leaves the tabs from 1 to (cursor-1) closed, but we still have tabs from (cursor) to (l-1) open? Actually, no: the left-close operation closes all tabs to the left of the cursor, so if the cursor is at i and i < l, then the left-close operation closes [1, i-1]. But we need to close [1, l-1]. So if i < l, then after closing the left part we still have tabs from i to l-1 open, which is not allowed because we want only [l, r]. So we must then close the remaining part from the left? Or move further.\n\n   Alternatively, we must first move the cursor to at least l to be able to close the entire left part.\n\n   Similarly, if we are at a position greater than r, we must first move to at most r to close the entire right part.\n\n   Therefore, the necessary steps are:\n\n   - If l == 1 and r == n: 0.\n\n   - Otherwise, we must close the left part (if l>1) and/or the right part (if r<n).\n\n   Now, how many moves and closes?\n\n   We can consider two strategies:\n\n   Strategy 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n     Steps for left close:\n        - If the cursor is not >= l, we need to move to at least l. The minimal movement to get to l is |pos - l| (but note: we are constrained by the boundaries, but initially the boundaries are [1, n] so we can move freely). However, after closing the left part, the boundaries change, but that doesn't affect the right part because we haven't closed the right part yet.\n\n        But wait: actually, after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes the cursor's position (which is at least l) and the right boundary remains n until we close the right part.\n\n        Then, to close the right part, we must be at a position <= r. So we may need to move from the current cursor (which is at l, or somewhere between l and n) to r (if the cursor is beyond r, we must move left; if the cursor is at or below r, we don't need to move).\n\n        However, we can choose to move to l (if we haven't already) and then close the left part. Then from l, we can move to r (if necessary) and then close the right part.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Move from `pos` to l. Time: abs(pos - l)\n          Step 2: Close left. Time: 1\n          Step 3: Now the left boundary is l. Then we need to close the right part. But we are at l. We must move to r (if we are not already at r). Time: abs(l - r)\n          Step 4: Close right. Time: 1\n\n        Total: abs(pos-l) + 1 + abs(l-r) + 1 = abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r) + 2\n\n     But wait: what if we can do better by not going all the way to l first? For example, if we are already beyond r (to the right of r) then we can close the right part first, then move to l and close the left part.\n\n   Strategy 2: Close right first, then left.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Move from `pos` to r. Time: abs(pos - r)\n          Step 2: Close right. Time: 1\n          Step 3: Move from r to l. Time: abs(r - l)\n          Step 4: Close left. Time: 1\n\n        Total: abs(pos - r) + abs(r-l) + 2\n\n   However, note: sometimes we might not need to do both operations. For example, if we don't need to close the left part (l==1) then we don't do the left part. Similarly, if we don't need to close the right part (r==n) then we don't do the right part.\n\n   Also, there is a possibility that we can do both operations from the same position? Actually, if the cursor is already in [l, r] (which it always is, because initially the tabs are from 1 to n and we want to leave [l, r] so the cursor might be outside [l, r] initially) then we have to move the cursor to [l, r] to do the closing.\n\n   Actually, the cursor might be outside [l, r] initially. We have two cases:\n\n     Case 1: The cursor is in [l, r] initially.\n\n        Then we can potentially do:\n\n          Option A: Close left and right from the same position? \n            - But to close the left part we must be at a position >= l (we are, because we are in [l, r]), so we can close the left part from our current position (if l>1) and then we are still in [l, r] (since we are at a position >= l, and after closing left the left boundary becomes our current position, but we are still >= l). Then we can close the right part from the same position (if r<n) because we are <= r.\n\n          So if the cursor is in [l, r] and we need to close both sides, then we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Close left (if l>1) -> 1 second\n            Step 2: Close right (if r<n) -> 1 second\n\n          Total: 2 seconds.\n\n        However, wait: is that valid? \n\n          Example: n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9.\n\n          Initially: [1,10] open, cursor at 5.\n\n          Operation: close left (from 5) -> closes [1,4]. Then the boundaries become [5,10]. Then we can close the right (from 5) -> closes [6,10]. Then we have [5,5] and then we closed the right from 5? Actually, the problem says: closing the right from 5 closes [6,10] (because the current boundaries are [5,10]). But then we are left with [5,5] and we wanted [2,9]. But wait, we left tab 5, which is in [2,9], but we also have tab 5? Actually, we did close [1,4] and [6,10] so the remaining tabs are [5] which is in [2,9]. But the problem requires leaving [l, r] (from 2 to 9) so we must leave tabs 2 to 9. However, we closed tab 5? No, we didn't close the cursor's current tab. The operation \"close all tabs to the left\" doesn't close the cursor, and similarly for the right.\n\n          Correction: In the example, we started with [1,10] and closed [1,4] (so remaining [5,10]) and then closed [6,10] (so remaining [5]). But we wanted [2,9]. So this is incorrect.\n\n        What went wrong? We cannot leave only [5] because [l, r] is [2,9]. We must leave [2,9]. Therefore, we cannot close the left part from 5 because that would close [1,4] (which is correct) but then we must leave [5,10] and then we close the right part from 5 which closes [6,10] (leaving [5]), but [5] is a subset of [2,9] and we are allowed to have more tabs? Actually, no: the problem says \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\", meaning we must have exactly the tabs [l, r] and nothing else. But wait, the example says: \"In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n        In the first test: Input \"6 3 2 4\". They moved the cursor to 2, closed left, then moved to 3 and 4 and closed right. The result is that they leave [2,4]. \n\n        So we must leave the entire segment [l, r] and nothing else.\n\n        Therefore, we must not close any tab that is in [l, r] (except that we can close the ones outside). But note: the operations close contiguous segments to the left or right. \n\n        The key: the closing operations close a contiguous segment (all the way from the boundary to the cursor's side). \n\n        In the example above (n=10, l=2, r=9, pos=5): \n\n          We must close [1,1] and [10,10] (because we want [2,9]). But note: the operation \"close left\" from a cursor at 5 would close [1,4] (if we do it before closing the right) and then we are left with [5,10]. Then we must close [5,10] from the right? But we cannot because we are at 5 and we close [6,10] (then we have [5]), but we are missing [2,4] and [6,9] is not entirely closed? Actually, we want to leave [2,9]. So we must close [1,1] and [10,10] (only the very ends) but we cannot do that because the operations close everything from the boundary to the cursor.\n\n        Let me re-read the problem: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" meaning [a, i-1] (so from the current left boundary a to the cursor's left). Similarly, right-close: [i+1, b].\n\n        Therefore, we can only close contiguous blocks from the boundary to the cursor.\n\n        This means:\n\n          To remove [1,1] (if l=2), we must have the cursor at 2 or above (so that 1 is to the left of the cursor). Then when we close the left, it will remove [a, i-1]. Initially a=1, so if we are at 2, then we remove [1,1]. Similarly, to remove [10,10] (if r=9) we must have the cursor at 9 or below, then we close [i+1, b] and if we are at 9, then [10,10] is removed.\n\n        So the problem becomes:\n\n          We must remove the left part (from 1 to l-1) and the right part (from r+1 to n). And we can only remove contiguous segments from the boundaries to the cursor.\n\n        Therefore, we must:\n\n          - Remove the left part: we need to have the cursor at a position >= l (so that the left-close operation will remove [1, l-1] because then the left-close operation will remove from the current left boundary (which is 1) to the cursor's left (which is >= l, so l-1 is included). But note: if the cursor is at l, then the left-close operation removes [1, l-1] exactly.\n\n          - Remove the right part: we need to have the cursor at a position <= r (so that the right-close operation removes [r+1, n]).\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n          Option 1: \n            - First, move the cursor to l (if necessary) and then close the left part (if l>1).\n            - Then, move the cursor to r (if necessary) and then close the right part (if r<n).\n\n          Option 2:\n            - First, move the cursor to r (if necessary) and then close the right part (if r<n).\n            - Then, move the cursor to l (if necessary) and then close the left part (if l>1).\n\n        But note: we might be able to avoid moving twice if we are already in the correct segment. Also, we might do one operation and then the other without moving again.\n\n        Actually, the optimal strategy is:\n\n          Let left_required = (l > 1)   [meaning we need to close left part]\n          Let right_required = (r < n)   [meaning we need to close right part]\n\n          If not left_required and not right_required:\n             answer = 0\n\n          Else if left_required and not right_required:\n             Then we only need to close the left part. But to close the left part, we must be at a position >= l. So we must move to l (if we are not already there). Then one operation.\n\n             Steps: \n                 If the cursor is already >= l, then we can directly close left (1 second).\n                 Else, we must move to l (abs(pos - l) seconds) and then close (1 second).\n\n             However, note: if we are already >= l, then we don't need to move, so total seconds = 1.\n             But if we are not, then we move and then close: abs(pos - l) + 1.\n\n          Similarly, if not left_required and right_required:\n             Steps: \n                 If the cursor is already <= r, then 1 second.\n                 Else, move to r (abs(pos - r)) and then close (1 second).\n\n          Else (both required):\n\n             We have two possibilities:\n\n             Possibility 1: \n                 Move to l, close left, then move to r, close right.\n\n                 Time: abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n             Possibility 2:\n                 Move to r, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\n                 Time: abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n             But note: we might be able to combine the movement? For example, if we are initially between l and r, we might do:\n\n                 Option: \n                    If we are in [l, r] (so we are already at a position that is >= l and <= r) then we can do:\n\n                    - Close left and right in two operations (without moving) if we are in [l, r] and both sides are to be closed.\n\n                    However, wait: after closing one side, the boundaries change. But note: we are allowed to do two operations from the same position.\n\n                    Example: n=10, l=2, r=9, and we start at 5.\n\n                    Option 1: \n                      Step 1: Close left from 5 -> closes [1,4] (now the boundaries are [5,10])\n                      Step 2: Close right from 5 -> closes [6,10] (now the boundaries are [5,5])\n\n                    But then we have only [5] left, which is not [2,9]. We must leave [2,9]. So we cannot do that.\n\n                    Why? Because the operations close everything to the left and right, but we must leave [l, r] (which is [2,9]). We cannot leave [5] because 5 is in [2,9] but we must leave all the tabs from 2 to 9. \n\n                    The problem says: \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\". So we must have exactly the set {2,3,...,9}. Therefore, we must not close any tab that is in [2,9]. \n\n                    But wait, the operations close contiguous segments from the boundary to the cursor. The left-close operation closes [1,4] (which is good) and the right-close operation closes [6,10] (which is good). However, the tabs [5] are left, but 5 is in [2,9] so that is okay? \n\n                    Actually, yes: the problem does not require to remove the extra tabs from [l, r] (we are allowed to leave them). The requirement is to leave only the tabs in [l, r] (meaning we can leave more than [l, r] as long as we don't leave any tab outside [l, r]?) \n\n                    Let me read the problem statement: \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened\".\n\n                    This means: we must leave exactly the set {l, l+1, ..., r} and nothing else.\n\n                    In the example, we left [5] which is a subset of [2,9] but not the entire [2,9]. So that is not acceptable.\n\n                    Therefore, we must leave all the tabs from 2 to 9. We cannot close the tab 5 because 5 is in [2,9]? \n\n                    Actually, we did not close the tab 5. The left-close operation closes [1,4] (so 1,2,3,4 are closed? Wait, no: the left-close operation closes [a, i-1] (from the current left boundary to the cursor's left). Initially, a=1, and the cursor is at 5, so we close [1,4]. That leaves 5,6,...,10. Then we do a right-close: [6,10] are closed, so we are left with 5. But 5 is in [2,9] so we are not supposed to close it.\n\n                    However, the problem does not say we must close the tabs that are in [l, r]. It says we must close all the tabs that don't belong to [l, r]. So we are allowed to leave [l, r] as a superset? Actually, no: we must leave exactly [l, r]. \n\n                    The example: Input \"6 3 2 4\" -> Output 5. In that example, the desired result is to have tabs 2,3,4. \n\n                    So we must remove the ones outside. But note: the operation does not distinguish between the tabs that are in [l, r] and those that are not. The operation simply removes a contiguous segment from the boundary to the cursor.\n\n                    Therefore, we must not remove any tab that is in [l, r]. So how do we remove only the ones outside?\n\n                    The key is: we cannot remove a tab that is in [l, r] by mistake. \n\n                    Consider: if we close the left part from a position that is too far to the right, we might remove part of [l, r]. Similarly for the right.\n\n                    Therefore, the procedure must be:\n\n                    - We must close the left part (all tabs < l) by having the cursor at l (so that we remove [1, l-1] and leave l and above). Then, we must close the right part by having the cursor at r (so that we remove [r+1, n] and leave up to r).\n\n                    But note: after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes l, and the tabs from l to n remain. Then we close the right part from r, which removes [r+1, n] (if any) and leaves [l, r]. \n\n                    However, we must ensure that the cursor is at l when we close the left part, and then we must move to r to close the right part (unless we are already at r). Similarly, if we do the reverse.\n\n                    But wait: in the example \"6 3 2 4\", the steps are:\n\n                      Start: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n                      Step1: move to 2 (from 3 to 2: 1 second)\n                      Step2: close left (removes [1,1]) -> 1 second, now the boundaries are [2,6]\n                      Step3: move from 2 to 4 (two moves: 2->3->4, but wait the problem says: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4. So two moves? Actually, from 2 to 4: |2-4|=2 moves.\n                      Step4: close right (removes [5,6]) -> 1 second.\n\n                    Total: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n                    But note: the example input was \"6 3 2 4\", and the answer is 5.\n\n                    Now, why can't we do:\n\n                      Step1: move to 4 (from 3 to 4: 1 second)\n                      Step2: close right (removes [5,6]) -> 1 second, now boundaries [1,4]\n                      Step3: move to 2 (from 4 to 2: 2 seconds)\n                      Step4: close left (removes [1,1]) -> 1 second.\n\n                    Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n                    So both orders give 5.\n\n                    However, consider if we are already at 3 (the initial position). We cannot close the left part from 3 because that would remove [1,2] (but we want to keep 2). Similarly, we cannot close the right part from 3 because that would remove [4,6] (but we want to keep 4).\n\n                    Therefore, we must move the cursor to l (2) to close the left part, and then move to r (4) to close the right part.\n\n                    But note: we might be able to do one move that covers both? Actually, no: because to close the left part we must be at l or above, but if we are above l then the left-close operation would remove more than just [1, l-1] (if we are above l, then [1, i-1] would include [1, l-1] and [l, i-1] as well, but we don't want to remove [l, i-1] because they are part of [l, r]). \n\n                    Therefore, to safely close the left part, we must be exactly at l (so that [1, l-1] is removed and [l, ...] remains). Similarly, to safely close the right part, we must be exactly at r.\n\n                    So the procedure is:\n\n                      If we need to close the left part, we must be at l.\n                      If we need to close the right part, we must be at r.\n\n                    And we must do the closing operations from these positions.\n\n                    Therefore, the minimal steps for the two-part case (both left and right to be closed) is:\n\n                      Option 1: \n                          Move from `pos` to l (abs(pos-l)), then to r (abs(l-r)), and two closing operations (each 1 second).\n\n                      Option 2: \n                          Move from `pos` to r (abs(pos-r)), then to l (abs(r-l)), and two closing operations.\n\n                    But note: we might not need to go from l to r if we are already at r when we come from the left? Actually, the two options are symmetric.\n\n                    However, we can also consider: what if we do one closing operation and then the other without going back and forth? But we must be at the respective positions.\n\n                    Therefore, the total time is min( \n                         abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, \n                         abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2 \n                     )\n\n                    But note: abs(l - r) is the same as abs(r - l). So:\n\n                    total_time = min( abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2 )\n\n                    However, wait: the movement from `pos` to l and then from l to r is abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r). Similarly, from `pos` to r and then from r to l is abs(pos-r) + abs(r-l) (which is the same as abs(pos-r) + abs(l-r)).\n\n                    Therefore, we can write:\n\n                    if l == 1 and r == n:\n                        answer = 0\n                    elif l == 1:   # only right to close\n                        # We need to move to r (if we are not there) and then close right.\n                        if pos <= r:\n                            answer = 1\n                        else:\n                            answer = abs(pos - r) + 1\n                    elif r == n:   # only left to close\n                        if pos >= l:\n                            answer = 1\n                        else:\n                            answer = abs(pos - l) + 1\n                    else:\n                        # We need to do both: move to l and then to r, or move to r and then to l.\n                        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n                        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2\n                        answer = min(option1, option2)\n\n                    But wait: what if we are already in [l, r] but not at l or r? Then we have to move to one of the ends. However, note that the above conditions for the two-part case assume that we must go to both ends. But is that always necessary?\n\n                    Actually, to close the left part we must be at l, and to close the right part we must be at r. So even if we are between l and r, we still have to go to l and then to r (or vice versa). \n\n                    However, consider: if we are at a position p in [l, r], we can:\n\n                      Option A: \n                          Move to l (distance = abs(p-l)), then close left (1), then move to r (distance = abs(l-r)), then close right (1) -> total = abs(p-l) + abs(l-r) + 2.\n\n                      Option B:\n                          Move to r (distance = abs(p-r)), then close right (1), then move to l (distance = abs(r-l)), then close left (1) -> total = abs(p-r) + abs(l-r) + 2.\n\n                    So we take the minimum.\n\n                    But note: the starting position is `pos`, not necessarily in [l, r]. Actually, the problem says the cursor is initially at `pos` (which can be anywhere from 1 to n). So we must account for the starting position.\n\n                    However, the above code already uses `pos` in the calculations.\n\n                    But wait: what if the starting position is not in [l, r]? \n\n                    Example: n=10, pos=1 (which is < l, since l=2) and r=9. Then we must first move to l (from 1 to 2: 1 second) and then to r (from 2 to 9: 7 seconds) and then two closes: 1+7+2 = 10.\n\n                    But wait, we can also consider: \n\n                      We are at 1. We need to close the left part? Actually, the left part is [1,1] (because l=2) so we must close [1,1]. We can do:\n\n                          Option: \n                              Move from 1 to 2 (1 second), then close left (1 second). Then we are at 2, and then we need to close the right part (from 2 to 9, then move to 9 and close? Or from 2, we can close the right part? \n\n                      But to close the right part we must be at 9. So we must move from 2 to 9 (7 seconds) and then close right (1 second). Total: 1+1+7+1 = 10.\n\n                    So the formula for the two-part case is:\n\n                        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n                        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n                    However, note: the movement from `pos` to l might be longer than from `pos` to r, and vice versa.\n\n                    But wait: is there a possibility to do the two closing operations without moving to both ends? \n\n                    Let me think: \n\n                      We must close the left part: so we must be at l (exactly) to close [1, l-1] without affecting [l, r]. Similarly, for the right part.\n\n                    Therefore, the above formula is correct.\n\n                    However, note: we might be able to use the same path to do both operations if we are smart? \n\n                    Actually, no: because to close the left part we must be at l, and to close the right part we must be at r. These are two distinct positions (unless l==r, but then we don't need two operations because the segment [l, r] is a single tab and we must close both sides? Actually, if l==r, then we are leaving a single tab. Then we must close the left part (if l>1) and the right part (if r<n). But note: if l==r, then the left part is [1, l",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing different scenarios based on the initial cursor position and the segment [l, r] that needs to be left open.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba's browser has `n` tabs initially, with the cursor at position `pos`.\n   - She needs to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive open.\n   - Operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right (within boundaries) and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **No Action Needed**: If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r] (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - **Single Side Closure**: If only the left side (`l > 1`) or only the right side (`r < n`) needs closing, the solution involves moving the cursor to `l` or `r` respectively and performing a single close operation.\n   - **Both Sides Closure**: If both sides need closing, the minimal time is determined by choosing the optimal path: either moving to `l` first then to `r`, or vice versa, each followed by their respective close operations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - For cases where only one side needs closing, calculate the movement time to the respective end and add one second for the close operation.\n   - For both sides, compute the minimal time by considering both possible paths (left then right, or right then left) and selecting the shorter one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if l_val == 1:\n        if pos <= r_val:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(abs(pos - r_val) + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if r_val == n:\n        if pos >= l_val:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(abs(pos - l_val) + 1)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input consists of four integers: `n` (number of tabs), `pos` (initial cursor position), `l_val` (start of the desired segment), and `r_val` (end of the desired segment).\n- **No Operation Case**: If the desired segment covers all tabs (`l_val == 1` and `r_val == n`), output `0` since no operations are needed.\n- **Left Side Only**: If only the left side needs closing (`l_val == 1`), move the cursor to `r_val` if necessary, then perform a close operation (output `1` if already at or left of `r_val`, otherwise the movement plus `1`).\n- **Right Side Only**: Similarly, if only the right side needs closing (`r_val == n`), move the cursor to `l_val` if necessary, then perform a close operation.\n- **Both Sides Closure**: Calculate the time for both possible paths (moving to `l_val` first or `r_val` first) and choose the minimal time, adding `2` seconds for two close operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is computed by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
