The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and some integer t>=1 such that the snowflake has n vertices.\n\n How is the snowflake built?\n Rule 1: Start with one vertex (step 0).\n Rule 2: Then, we do at least one step. In each step, every leaf (vertex with degree 1) gets connected to k new vertices.\n\n However, note that the process is done in layers (or iterations). Let's denote:\n   Layer 0: 1 vertex.\n   Layer 1: k new vertices (so total vertices so far: 1 + k)\n   Layer 2: Each of the k vertices from layer 1 now becomes connected to k new ones? But wait: when we add the first layer, the initial vertex now has degree k (so not a leaf anymore). The leaves are the k new vertices. Then, in the next step, we take each of these k leaves and attach k new ones. So the second layer adds k * k vertices.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k more new vertices, and this step should be done at least once.\n\n So the process:\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k vertices -> total = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 will now have k new neighbors, so we add k*k vertices -> total = 1 + k + k^2.\n   Step 3: Then, we would add k^3, and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaf) is connected to k new ones. In the second step, the leaves are the k*k vertices we just added. Then we would do step 3: each of these k*k leaves gets k new ones -> then we add k^(3) vertices.\n\n However, wait: the center vertex (the initial one) is connected to k edges, so it is not a leaf. The first k vertices (layer1) are connected to the center and nothing else? Actually, no: after step1, the center has degree k, and each of the k vertices has degree 1 (connected only to the center). Then step2: we remove the leaves? Actually, no: we don't remove. We just add k new vertices for each leaf. But note: when we add k new vertices for a leaf, we are effectively changing the leaf's degree from 1 to 1+k (connecting to k new ones) and the leaf becomes an internal node. Then the new nodes are leaves.\n\n Therefore, the entire snowflake is built in a complete k-ary tree with a root and then layers. However, note that the root is included and the root is the only one that is not a leaf. But the problem says the process must be done at least once, meaning at least two layers (root and one layer) but note: the first step (step1) is mandatory and then we can do more steps.\n\n But note: the example smallest for k=4 is shown. Let me check: \n   Step0: 1 vertex (root)\n   Step1: root connects to 4 -> total 5 vertices.\n   Step2: each of the 4 leaves (from step1) connect to 4 new ones -> total 5 + 4*4 = 21? \n\n However, the example figure might show the smallest snowflake for k=4. Actually, the problem states: \"The smallest possible snowflake for k=4\". The smallest must be built by doing the first step (at least once) and then we must stop? Or do we have to do the step at least once and then we can stop after any number of steps?\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning that we must have at least one expansion (so at least two layers: the root and one layer). However, we can have more than one expansion. So the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   for some t>=1 (meaning at least one expansion, so t>=1, then the sum goes from exponent 0 to t).\n\n However, wait: the center is step0 (exponent0: 1). Then step1 (exponent1): k, step2 (exponent2): k^2, etc. So the total is a geometric series: n = (k^(t+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire expansion to go until t? Actually, the process is defined as: we start with the center, then we do at least one expansion (so we must have at least one layer). But the problem does not specify that we must do exactly t expansions, we can choose t>=1.\n\n However, note: the example input and expected output:\n\n Input: \n  9\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  6\n  13\n  15\n  255\n  10101\n  1000000000000000000\n\n Expected Output:\n  NO\n  NO\n  NO\n  NO\n  YES\n  YES\n  YES\n  YES\n  NO\n\n Let's test with n=1: \n   The snowflake must have at least one expansion (so at least one layer). The minimal snowflake (with one expansion) has 1 + k vertices. Since k>1, minimal n is 1+2=3. So n=1 is too small -> \"NO\"\n\n n=2: same, minimal is 3 -> \"NO\"\n\n n=3: minimal is 3 (if k=2, then 1+2 = 3). So n=3 should be \"YES\", but the expected output says \"NO\".\n\n Wait, let's read the problem again: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n Note: the step of adding k new vertices for each leaf must be done at least once. That means we must have at least two layers (the initial expansion and then the expansion for the leaves). However, wait: the first expansion (from the center) is the first step, and then the second expansion (from the leaves) is the second step. So the minimal snowflake must have two layers? \n\n But then the minimal n for k=2 would be: 1 (center) + 2 (first layer) + 2*2 (second layer) = 1+2+4 = 7.\n\n However, the example input says n=3 is \"NO\", and n=6 is \"NO\", and n=13 is \"YES\". \n\n Let me reexamine the construction:\n\n According to the problem statement, the smallest snowflake for k=4 is shown. But note: the problem says \"the smallest possible snowflake for k=4\", meaning that we do the process at least once (so one expansion) and then we stop. But wait, the process is defined as:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: connect the center to k new ones -> total = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: then, for each leaf (the k new ones) we connect k new ones. But note: the problem says \"this step should be done at least once\", meaning that we must do step1 (which is the expansion from the center) and then we must do step2 (the expansion from the leaves) at least once? Or is step1 considered the first expansion and then the condition is that we must do the expansion (from leaves) at least once?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This suggests that the entire process is:\n\n   Step 0: center (degree 0)\n   Then we do step1 (expanding the center) and then we must do the expansion for leaves at least once.\n\n So the minimal process is:\n\n   Step0: center (vertex count=1)\n   Step1: add k vertices (now we have 1+k, and the center has degree k, the k new vertices have degree 1) -> this is mandatory because k>1 is given, but note: the rule says we start with one vertex and then we do the expansion (from the center) and then we must do the expansion from leaves at least once.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, the next part says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory (because k>1 is given) and then the expansion from leaves is also mandatory (at least once). Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have:\n\n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: k\n   Layer2: k*k   (because each of the k leaves from layer1 is expanded)\n\n So the minimal total vertices is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n Now, let's check with n=3: \n   We need 1 + k + k^2 = 3. Then k^2 + k + 1 = 3 -> k^2 + k -2 =0. Solutions: k=(-1±sqrt(1+8))/2 = (-1±3)/2 -> k=1 or k=-2. But k>1 is required. So no solution for n=3.\n\n Similarly, n=6: \n   1 + k + k^2 = 6 -> k^2+k-5=0. k=( -1 ± sqrt(21) )/2 -> not integer.\n\n But wait, what if we do more than two layers? The total number of vertices is the sum of a geometric series: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t, where t>=2 (since at least two expansions: layer0, layer1, layer2) but note: the first expansion (layer1) is the first mandatory expansion, and then the second expansion (layer2) is the second mandatory expansion. Then we can optionally do more.\n\n Alternatively, note: the problem does not specify that we must stop after two layers. We can have any number of expansions (steps) as long as we do at least one expansion from the leaves (i.e., at least two layers: center, layer1, and layer2). But wait, the problem says:\n\n   Step1: center expands to k (mandatory because k>1 is given and the rule says we do that)\n   Step2: then we must do the expansion from leaves at least once (so we must have at least two layers of expansion beyond the center? Actually, the center is the first layer, then we have the first expansion (layer1) and then the expansion from the leaves (layer2) is mandatory.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say we have to stop. We can do more than two layers. So the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^t, for some t>=2 (because we must have at least two expansions: the first expansion (center to layer1) and then the second expansion (layer1 to layer2)).\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", and that step is the expansion from leaves. The first expansion (from the center) is done by the rule, and then the expansion from leaves is done at least once. So the minimal t is 2 (meaning two expansions: center expansion and one expansion from leaves).\n\n Therefore, n must be expressed as:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^t,   for some integers k>1 and t>=2.\n\n But note: we could also interpret the problem differently. Let me read the problem again:\n\n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n   Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This implies that after the initial expansion (k new vertices), we must do the expansion from leaves at least once. So the minimal is two layers: the center and two layers of expansion (but the center is the root, then the first expansion gives the first ring, and the second expansion gives the second ring). \n\n However, note that the problem does not require the expansion to stop after two layers. We can have:\n\n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: k\n   Layer2: k*k\n   Layer3: k*k*k   (and so on)\n\n So the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t,   with t>=1 (for the first expansion) and then we require at least one more expansion (so the last exponent must be at least 2). \n\n Actually, wait: the first expansion (from the center) is the first time we add k vertices, and then we must do at least one expansion from the leaves (which are the k vertices). So the minimal t is 2 (two layers: the center and two rings). But note: the center is included, then we have two expansions (the center expansion and the leaf expansion) so the exponents go from 0 to 2.\n\n But we can have more than two layers. So the general form is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t,   for some t>=2 and k>1.\n\n However, note: the center is the 0-th layer (exponent0). Then the first expansion (from the center) gives layer1 (exponent1). Then the expansion from the leaves (which are layer1) gives layer2 (exponent2). Then we can continue.\n\n Therefore, the equation is:\n\n   n = (k^(t+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for some integers k>1 and t>=2.\n\n But note: k must be an integer greater than 1, and t is an integer at least 2.\n\n However, we are given n (up to 10^18) and we have to check if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer t>=2 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n But note: we can also consider t=1 (one expansion from the center) but then we haven't done the leaf expansion at least once. The problem requires at least one leaf expansion. So t must be at least 2 (so the expansion from leaves is done at least once, meaning we have two layers of expansion beyond the center? Actually, the center is the root, then we have two layers: the first layer (k) and the second layer (k*k). So the expansion from leaves (the first layer) is the second expansion (t=2).\n\n How can we solve for n up to 10^18?\n\n Observation: \n   For a fixed t (>=2), we can try to find an integer k>1 such that (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix k and then see what t would be? But k can be very large.\n\n Another observation: \n   The minimal n for a fixed t is when k=2: then n = (2^(t+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(t+1)-1.\n\n   For t=2: minimal n = 2^3-1 = 7.\n   For t=3: minimal n = 15.\n   For t=4: minimal n = 31.\n\n But note: k doesn't have to be 2. For example, when n=13, we can have:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... (until t=?) \n\n   Let t=2: then n = 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k^2+k+1=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1 ± sqrt(49) )/2 = ( -1+7 )/2 = 3. So k=3, t=2: 1+3+9=13 -> YES.\n\n   Also, n=15: \n        t=2: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> no integer solution (discriminant=57, not a perfect square).\n        t=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. k=2: 8+4+2-14=0 -> yes, so k=2, t=3: 1+2+4+8=15.\n\n   n=255: \n        We know 2^8-1=255, so (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255 -> t+1=8 -> t=7, which is >=2 -> YES.\n\n   n=10101: \n        We need to check if there exists k>1 and t>=2 such that (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)=10101.\n\n        Alternatively, we can factorize 10101. But note: the formula is a geometric series.\n\n        We can iterate over t from 2 up to about 60 (because 2^60 is around 1e18, and for k=2, t=60 gives a number of about 2^60 which is huge, but our n is 10101, so t is at most log_k(10101). For k=2, t is about log2(10101) ~ 14. But we can also try k from 2 to ... but k can be as large as 10101 (if t=1, but t>=2 so k must be <= sqrt(10101) for t=2? Actually, for t=2: k^2 < n, so k <= sqrt(n). Similarly, for t=3: k^3 < n, so k <= cube_root(n). \n\n        However, note: we can also have multiple layers. But the total n is fixed.\n\n        Alternate approach: \n          We know that the number n must be represented as:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t,   t>=2, k>=2.\n\n          We can fix t (from 2 up to about 60, because even for k=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, so we can iterate t from 2 to 60) and then solve for k.\n\n          For a fixed t, we have:\n\n            n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = 0 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n          Rearranged: k^(t+1) - 1 = (n)*(k-1)\n\n          This is a polynomial equation of degree t+1. But note: we are looking for integer k>1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use binary search for k for fixed t? But t is small (<=60) and k must be an integer. However, k is at least 2 and at most n (but note: for fixed t, k is bounded by the (t+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but we don't know k). \n\n        Instead, we can use the following: for a fixed t, we can consider:\n\n          Let f(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n        We can solve for k by considering that k is an integer and we can bound k: \n\n          Since the series has t+1 terms (exponents 0 to t), the largest term is k^t. Then:\n\n            k^t < n < (k^(t+1))/(k-1)\n\n        Actually, we can use the fact that:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\n          and note that:\n\n            k^t <= n <= (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)   [by definition]\n\n        But we want to find k for fixed t. We can rearrange:\n\n          n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)   =>   k^(t+1) - (n*(k-1)+1) = 0.\n\n        This is a polynomial of degree t+1, which is too high to solve algebraically for large t.\n\n        However, note that t is at most 60, but k must be an integer and we can use binary search for k for a fixed t? But the range of k: k_min=2, k_max: we have k^t <= n, so k <= n^(1/t). Since n can be up to 10^18, and t>=2, then k_max is at most 10^(18/t). For t=2, k_max ~ 10^9, which is too big to iterate. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n          We know that for fixed t, the function f(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1. So we can do a binary search for k in [2, n] (but n is up to 10^18, so we cannot iterate from 2 to n). \n\n        But note: for fixed t, k is at most around the (t+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1. Actually, we can set an upper bound for k: since the series is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\n          and the last term is k^t, so k^t <= n, so k <= n**(1/t). And t is at least 2, so we can compute an upper bound for k as floor(n**(1/t)) + 10 (to be safe). However, note that the series has t+1 terms, so:\n\n          n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) >= k^t   (because the last term is k^t, and the rest are positive)\n\n          and also, n <= (k^(t+1))/(k-1)   [since (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) < k^(t+1)/(k-1)]\n\n        But we can use:\n\n          k^t <= n <= (k^(t+1))/(k-1)\n\n        We can set an upper bound for k: \n\n          k^t <= n  => k <= n**(1/t)\n\n        Then, for fixed t, we can iterate k from 2 to ceil(n**(1/t))? But n=10^18 and t=2: then k up to 1e9, which is too many to iterate for each test case (and t from 2 to about 60, and 10^4 test cases). \n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          We know that the representation is unique for fixed t? Actually, for fixed t, the equation (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)=n has at most one positive integer solution for k (if any). \n\n        And note: we are iterating t from 2 up to about 60 (since for k=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, so t+1 can be at most about 60). So we can iterate t from 2 to 60 (about 59 values) and for each t, we can solve for k without iterating over all possibilities.\n\n        How? We can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n**(1/t)) + 1] (but note: the series has t+1 terms, so k^t <= n, but actually the entire sum is n, so k must be <= n**(1/t) because the last term is k^t and the rest are positive, so k^t <= n).\n\n        Steps for a fixed t and given n:\n\n          Let low = 2, high = int(round(n**(1/t))) + 10   (but careful: n**(1/t) may be fractional)\n\n        But note: we can use:\n\n          We know that k must satisfy: k^t <= n, so we set high = int(n**(1/t)) + 100   (to account for rounding)\n\n        Then, we want to check if there exists an integer k in [2, high] such that (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) == n.\n\n        However, computing k^(t+1) for k up to 10^9 and t=2 is 10^18, which is acceptable for Python integers, but if k is large (like 10^9) and t=60, then k^(t+1) is astronomical (10^540) which is not representable.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid using high = n**(1/t) for large t (like 60) because then k is about 2, since 2^60 is already 1e18, so for t>=60, k can only be 1 or 2, but k>=2, so k=2 and then we check if (2^(61)-1)/(2-1)=2^61-1 == n. \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the iteration for t: \n\n          For t>=2, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2+...+k^t. The minimal k is 2, so minimal n for a given t is (2^(t+1)-1). \n\n          If n < (2^(t+1)-1, then we can break because increasing t further will only increase the minimal n.\n\n        Actually, we can iterate t from 2 to about 60 (but note: when t is large, k must be 2, because if k>=3 then 3^t is already too big for n up to 10^18). \n\n        Proposed plan:\n\n          For each test case (n):\n            If n==1: then NO (but note: the minimal n is 7, so n=1,2,...,6 are all NO, but wait: the problem says the first expansion (from the center) and then the expansion from leaves (at least once) so minimal n=1+2+4=7. However, note: the problem says k>1, so k>=2.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              1. Check if n < 7 -> then NO (because the smallest n is 7).\n\n              2. Iterate t from 2 up to 60 (or until the minimal representation with k=2 exceeds n):\n\n                 Let min_n = (2**(t+1))-1   (the minimal n for this t, with k=2)\n                 If min_n > n: then for this t and larger t, we won't find any solution (because even the smallest n for t is too big). So break.\n\n                 Otherwise, we need to check if there exists an integer k (>=2) such that:\n\n                    (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n                 We can rearrange: k^(t+1) - (n*(k-1)+1) = 0.\n\n                 But note: we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/t)] (approximately). However, we must be cautious because n is up to 10^18.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    We know that k must be an integer, and the equation is:\n\n                    n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n                 We can use the fact that k is the base and we can use logarithms? But that might be imprecise.\n\n                 Instead, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, int(round(n**(1/t)))+1] (but we must set an upper bound: k_max = min(2**60, n) but n is 10^18, and for t>=2, k_max is at most 10^9 for t=2, which is too many to iterate by linear scan.\n\n                 But note: we are iterating over t from 2 to 60, and for each t we do a binary search over k. The total number of t is 59, and for each t the binary search will run in O(log(k_max)) which is about 30 iterations per t. Then total operations is 59*30 ~ 1770 per test case. But we have up to 10^4 test cases, so 10^4 * 1770 ~ 17.7e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n                 However, note that for each t, we are doing exponentiation (k^(t+1)) which for k_max=10^9 and t=2: that's 10^18, which is acceptable in Python (integers are arbitrary precision, but exponentiation of integers up to 10^9 to the power 3 is acceptable for t=2, but for t=60, k=2: 2^61 is acceptable, but for k=3 and t=60: 3^61 is too big? Actually, we are breaking t when min_n (with k=2) is greater than n, so for large t, k must be 2. \n\n                 But wait: for large t, k must be 2, so we can handle separately: if t is large, then k must be 2 (because if k>=3, then 3^t is already greater than n). So we can set:\n\n                    k_min = 2\n                    k_max = None\n\n                 But we can set k_max = 2 when t is large enough so that 3^t > n.\n\n                 Actually, we can set:\n\n                    if t > 50: then k must be 2 (because if k>=3, then 3^t >= 3^50 which is about 1e23, and n<=10^18, so indeed for t>=50, k must be 2). \n\n                 So we can do:\n\n                    For t from 2 to 60:\n\n                      Let k_low = 2\n                      Let k_high = None\n\n                      If t > 50:\n                          k_high = 2   # then we only check k=2.\n\n                      Else:\n                          k_high = int(round(n**(1/t))) + 10   # but we must be cautious: n**(1/t) might be fractional, and we are dealing with integers.\n\n                 However, we can use:\n\n                    We know that k^t <= n (because the series has at least the term k^t and the rest positive, so k^t <= n). Therefore, k <= n**(1/t). But we cannot compute n**(1/t) for large n and t=2: that gives an integer or a float that is an integer? \n\n                 Alternatively, we can set:\n\n                    k_high = 2\n                    while (k_high)**t <= n:\n                        k_high *= 2\n\n                    Then k_high is an upper bound (maybe too high) but we can then use binary search in [2, k_high] for k.\n\n                 But note: we are iterating t from 2 to 60, and for each t we do a doubling to get an upper bound. The doubling starts from 2, and we double until k_high^t > n. The number of doublings is logarithmic in n. For n=10^18, t=2: we need to double until k_high^2 > 10^18 -> k_high > 10^9, which is about 30 doublings (2^30 ~ 1e9). Then we do a binary search (another 30 steps) so total 60 steps per t. Then for each test case, we do 59 * 60 = 3540 steps, and 10^4 test cases: 35.4e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n                 However, we can avoid the doubling by using:\n\n                    k_high = 2\n                    while (k_high)**t <= n:\n                        k_high = k_high * 2\n\n                 Then we have an upper bound k_high (which is the smallest power of 2 such that k_high^t > n). Then we can binary search in [2, k_high] for k.\n\n                 But note: the equation is:\n\n                    S(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n                 However, we cannot compute k^(t+1) for k near 10^9 and t=2 because that is 10^18, which is acceptable. But for t=60 and k=2, we can compute 2^61 which is about 2e18, which is acceptable (Python integers are fine). But for k=10^9 and t=60, we cannot compute (10^9)^61 because that number is too big (10^549). \n\n                 Therefore, we must avoid computing k^(t+1) for k that is too large and t that is too large. \n\n                 Alternative: we can use the equation:\n\n                    n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n                 We can check without computing k^(t+1) by using a loop that computes the geometric series? But that would be O(t) per candidate k, and t is up to 60, and we are doing a binary search (about 60 steps) for each t (59 t's) and for each test case (10^4) -> 59*60*60*10^4 = 212,400,000 * 60? Wait, no: the binary search for each t is about 60 steps (each step computes the geometric series with t+1 terms, which is 60 terms). Then for each test case: 59 * (number of binary search steps) * (t) ~ 59 * 60 * 60 = 212400, and then 10^4 test cases: 212400 * 10000 = 2.124e9, which might be too slow in Python.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can use the closed-form formula but avoid huge numbers by checking the equation in logarithmic space? Not exact.\n\n                 We need a better way.\n\n        After reading the constraints, note that n can be as large as 10^18, but t is at most 60. We can compute the geometric series for a candidate k (without having to use huge numbers) by breaking early if the partial sum exceeds n.\n\n        Steps for fixed t and candidate k:\n\n          We want to compute the geometric series: s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            s = 1\n            term = 1\n            for i in range(1, t+1):\n                term *= k\n                s += term\n                if s > n:\n                    break\n\n          Then compare s and n.\n\n        But note: we are iterating k in a binary search. We can do this for each candidate k. However, the binary search for k will run for about 60 steps (each step testing one k) and for each k we do a loop of t+1 steps (t<=60). So each candidate k takes 61 multiplications. Then the entire test case would do 59 * (number of candidate k's) * 61.\n\n        How many candidate k's? The binary search for k for fixed t: we start with [low, high] (initially [2, k_high]). The number of candidates is O(log(k_high)), and k_high is initially set by doubling (which gives an upper bound that is a power of two). The doubling started from 2 and doubled until k_high^t > n. The number of doublings is about log2(n**(1/t)) = (log2(n))/t. For t=2, n=10^18, then (log2(10^18)) is about 60, so doubling about 60 times, then the upper bound is 2^60, which is about 1e18, but then the binary search would be from 2 to 1e18, which is 60 steps (each step checking a candidate k). Then for each candidate k, we do a loop of 61 steps",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single central vertex. Each subsequent layer expands by connecting each leaf vertex (vertices with degree 1) to \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). This expansion must be performed at least once, meaning the graph must have at least two layers beyond the central vertex.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in the snowflake graph forms a geometric series. Specifically, for a given \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 2 \\) (since at least one expansion beyond the initial layer is required), the total vertices \\( n \\) must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( t \\) represents the number of expansions beyond the initial central vertex, and \\( k \\) is the number of new vertices added at each expansion step.\n\n2. **Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists any integer \\( k > 1 \\) and integer \\( t \\geq 2 \\) such that the above equation holds. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can iterate over possible values of \\( t \\) (from 2 upwards) and for each \\( t \\), perform a binary search on \\( k \\) to find a valid solution.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Binary Search for \\( k \\)**: For each \\( t \\), we determine a range for \\( k \\) (from 2 to an upper bound derived from \\( n \\)) and check if the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).\n   - **Early Termination**: If for a given \\( t \\), the minimal sum (when \\( k = 2 \\)) exceeds \\( n \\), we can terminate early since larger \\( t \\) values will only require even larger \\( k \\) or sums.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible values of \\( t \\) and \\( k \\) using binary search. The number of test cases \\( t \\) is up to \\( 10^4 \\), and for each test case, the binary search runs in logarithmic time relative to \\( n \\), making the solution feasible within the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t_cases = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    index = 1\n    \n    for _ in range(t_cases):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_t = 60\n        \n        for exponent in range(2, max_t + 1):\n            min_val = (2**(exponent + 1)) - 1\n            if min_val > n:\n                break\n                \n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = 2\n            temp = high_k\n            while temp**exponent <= n:\n                low_k = high_k + 1\n                temp *= 2\n                if temp**exponent > n:\n                    high_k = temp\n                    break\n                    \n            if low_k > high_k:\n                low_k, high_k = high_k, low_k + 1\n                \n            while low_k <= high_k:\n                mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                try:\n                    total_vertices = 1\n                    term = 1\n                    for i in range(1, exponent + 1):\n                        term *= mid_k\n                        total_vertices += term\n                        if total_vertices > n:\n                            break\n                    if total_vertices == n:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                except OverflowError:\n                    high_k //= 2\n                    \n                if total_vertices < n:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                else:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        results.append(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n        \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's immediately deemed impossible to form a snowflake graph (since the smallest valid \\( n \\) is 7).\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Layers (t)**: For each test case, the algorithm checks possible values of \\( t \\) (number of expansions) from 2 to 60. For each \\( t \\), it calculates the minimal sum (when \\( k = 2 \\)).\n4. **Binary Search for \\( k \\)**: For each \\( t \\), the algorithm performs a binary search to find if there exists a \\( k \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).
