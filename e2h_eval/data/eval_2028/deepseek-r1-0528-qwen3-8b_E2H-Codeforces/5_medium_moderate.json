Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters). We have to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot) such that:\n - Two specific colors (non '?') must be the same.\n - An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any.\n\n However, note: a boot can be used at most once.\n\n We cannot use the same boot in more than one pair.\n\n The problem requires to output the maximum number of pairs and then the pairs (with the left boot index and the right boot index).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the matching must be between left and right boots. We are allowed to skip some boots.\n\n 2. The challenge: There are up to 150000 boots (so n=150000). We need an efficient solution.\n\n 3. Let's break down the problem:\n\n    We have two strings: `l` and `r`.\n\n    We can consider two types of boots:\n        - Fixed: a letter (not '?')\n        - Wildcard: '?'\n\n    However, note that a fixed color can only match a fixed color of the same letter or a wildcard on the other side? Actually, the rule says:\n        - Two specific colors must be the same.\n        - A wildcard is compatible with any.\n\n    So, for a left boot with color 'a':\n        - It can match a right boot with color 'a' or '?'.\n        - Similarly, a left boot with '?' can match any right boot (whether fixed or '?').\n\n    But note: we have to assign each boot at most once.\n\n 4. Approach:\n\n    We are to maximize the number of pairs. We can think greedily:\n\n    However, note that using a '?' in one side might be necessary to cover multiple possibilities, but we have to assign each boot at most once.\n\n    We can split the boots into:\n\n        Left side:\n            Type1: fixed letters (say, set L_fixed)\n            Type2: '?' (L_question)\n\n        Right side:\n            Type1: fixed letters (R_fixed)\n            Type2: '?' (R_question)\n\n    But note: the fixed letters must match exactly. However, we have two sets of fixed letters (left and right) and they might have overlapping letters.\n\n    We can form pairs in the following ways:\n\n        a) Fixed matches with fixed: if the left boot is 'x' and the right boot is 'x', then they can form a pair.\n\n        b) Fixed matches with wildcard: \n            - If left is fixed 'x' and right is '?', then they match.\n            - If left is '?' and right is fixed 'x', then they match.\n\n        c) Wildcard matches with wildcard: '?' and '?' match.\n\n    However, note: we have to choose which pairs to form without exceeding the available boots.\n\n    Since we want the maximum number, we should try to use as many fixed matches as possible, and then use wildcards to fill the rest? But wait: sometimes it might be beneficial to reserve a wildcard for a fixed boot? Actually, no: because a wildcard is more flexible. However, the catch: we cannot use a boot twice.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n        Step 1: First, we can form pairs between fixed and fixed. But note: what if we have a left fixed 'a' and a right fixed 'a'? Then we can form a pair. But what if we have a left fixed 'a' and a right fixed 'b'? Then we cannot.\n\n        However, also consider: we can use a wildcard in place of a fixed? No, because the wildcard can stand for any. But the problem is: we have a limited number of wildcards.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let's count the total pairs we can form from:\n\n            Option 1: Use fixed-to-fixed matches: For each color, we can count how many left boots have that fixed color and how many right boots have that fixed color. Then the maximum pairs we can form for color 'x' is min(count_left[x], count_right[x]). But wait: is that always optimal?\n\n            However, there's a catch: we can also use wildcards to match fixed boots. But note: if we use a wildcard to match a fixed boot, then that fixed boot is covered by the wildcard. But the fixed boot might have been matched with another fixed boot originally.\n\n            Actually, we have two kinds of matches:\n\n                Type A: both fixed and same letter.\n                Type B: one fixed and the other is wildcard.\n                Type C: both wildcards.\n\n            We want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        How about:\n\n            Let X = set of colors that appear (excluding '?') in either string.\n\n            Then, the fixed-to-fixed matches for a color c is min(freq_left(c), freq_right(c)).\n\n            Now, what about the remaining fixed boots? They cannot be matched by fixed-to-fixed, so we have to use them with wildcards.\n\n            Also, the wildcards can be used for fixed boots or for other wildcards.\n\n        Alternatively, we can model this as a bipartite graph:\n\n            Left nodes: indices 1 to n (for left boots)\n            Right nodes: indices 1 to n (for right boots)\n\n            Edges: \n                - For each left boot i with color c (if c != '?'), connect to every right boot j with color c (if c == r_j) OR if the right boot j is '?'? Actually, for a left boot i with color c (fixed):\n                    * It can connect to right boots j with color c (fixed) OR color '?'.\n                - Similarly, for a left boot i with color '?', connect to all right boots j (regardless of color).\n\n            But note: the graph is very large (n up to 150000) and the degree of each node might be high. We cannot build the entire graph.\n\n        We need a more efficient way.\n\n    Insight:\n\n        We can separate the matching into two parts:\n\n            Part 1: Matching fixed boots with fixed boots (same color). This is independent of wildcards.\n\n            Part 2: Matching the remaining fixed boots with wildcards, and then matching the remaining wildcards together.\n\n        But note: a fixed boot might be better matched with a fixed boot of the same color rather than a wildcard, because we might run out of wildcards for the other fixed boots.\n\n        Actually, the problem is that if we use a wildcard to match a fixed boot, then we are using one wildcard that could have been used for two boots (if we use two wildcards for one fixed boot? no: each boot is one entity). But note: each boot is one. The idea:\n\n            We want to maximize the total pairs. The total pairs is at most n.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Count the fixed-to-fixed matches for each color. But note: we have to assign the fixed boots optimally.\n\n            However, we cannot simply take the minimum for each color and then subtract because the same boot cannot be used twice.\n\n            We can use a greedy matching for fixed-to-fixed:\n\n                We can use a graph for fixed colors? But there are 26 colors. We can do:\n\n                    For each color c from 'a' to 'z':\n\n                        Let L[c] = list of indices (left boot indices) that have color c (and not '?')\n                        Let R[c] = list of indices (right boot indices) that have color c (and not '?')\n\n                    Then, we can match as many as min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|) for color c. But note: these indices are distinct.\n\n            Step 2: Now, we have leftover fixed boots (the ones not used in Step 1). Also, we have wildcards.\n\n            Step 3: Now, we can use wildcards to match the leftover fixed boots. But note: a wildcard can match any, so:\n\n                    We have two sets:\n\n                    LeftFixedLeft: the fixed boots (from left) that were not matched.\n                    RightFixedLeft: the fixed boots (from right) that were not matched.\n\n                    Additionally, we have:\n\n                    LeftWild: the left boots that are '?' and not matched.\n                    RightWild: the right boots that are '?' and not matched.\n\n            Now, we can use:\n\n                    - Each LeftWild can match with any unmatched right boot (including RightFixedLeft and RightWild).\n                    - Each RightWild can match with any unmatched left boot (including LeftFixedLeft and LeftWild).\n\n            But wait: we have to be careful because we are forming pairs and each boot only once.\n\n            However, note: we can also form pairs between LeftWild and RightWild.\n\n            Actually, the goal is to maximize the total pairs. We already matched the fixed-to-fixed. Now, we want to use the wildcards to match the leftovers.\n\n            How?\n\n            We can think of the remaining graph as:\n\n                Left nodes: LeftFixedLeft and LeftWild.\n                Right nodes: RightFixedLeft and RightWild.\n\n            Then, we can form:\n\n                - LeftFixedLeft can match with RightWild (because a fixed boot can match any, including wildcards) and also with RightFixedLeft? Actually, no: because fixed boots require the same fixed color. But we already matched the fixed boots of the same color, so the remaining fixed boots (on left) are of colors that are not present in the right fixed boots (or at least not enough to match). However, note: we did not necessarily match all fixed boots of a color: we matched min(L[c], R[c]) for each color. The leftover fixed boots (left) for color c are L[c] minus the matched ones. But these leftover fixed boots cannot be matched with fixed boots of color c because there are no remaining fixed boots of color c on the right (if there were, we would have matched more). However, they can be matched with wildcards.\n\n            Therefore, the leftover fixed boots (both left and right) can be matched with wildcards.\n\n            Now, the problem becomes: we have:\n\n                A: LeftFixedLeft (set of left boots that are fixed and not matched)\n                B: RightFixedLeft (set of right boots that are fixed and not matched)\n                C: LeftWild (set of left boots that are '?' and not matched)\n                D: RightWild (set of right boots that are '?' and not matched)\n\n            We can form:\n\n                - Pairs between A and D (LeftFixedLeft and RightWild)\n                - Pairs between C and B (LeftWild and RightFixedLeft)\n                - Pairs between C and D (LeftWild and RightWild)\n\n            But note: we cannot form a pair between a fixed boot and a fixed boot of different color because we already matched the same color ones and the rest don't have the same color.\n\n            However, wait: we did not consider that a fixed boot (left) of color 'a' might be matched with a wildcard (right) even though we have a fixed boot (right) of color 'a' that was not matched? Actually, no: because we matched as many as possible for color 'a'. So the leftover fixed boots of color 'a' on the left is L[a] minus the matched ones, and similarly for the right. But note: the matching for color 'a' was done independently. However, it is possible that we matched all the left boots of color 'a' (so no leftover) but the right boots of color 'a' still have some. Then we can use the leftover right boots of color 'a' to match with left wildcards.\n\n            But note: the above Step 1 does not necessarily match all fixed boots. We did:\n\n                For each color c, we matched min(L[c], R[c]) pairs. Then the leftover for color c on the left is L[c] minus the matched ones, and similarly for the right.\n\n            Now, we can use the wildcards to match the leftover fixed boots. But note: the same wildcard cannot be used twice.\n\n            The total pairs we can form from the leftovers is:\n\n                Let T = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|\n\n                We want to assign as many as possible. The constraints:\n\n                    - We cannot exceed the available wildcards and fixed boots.\n\n                Actually, we can model this as a bipartite graph again, but now the graph is:\n\n                    Left: A ∪ C\n                    Right: B ∪ D\n\n                And edges:\n\n                    - Every node in A is connected to every node in D? Actually, no: we don't know the colors. But note: the fixed boots in A have specific colors, and they can match any right boot (because the right boot can be fixed or wildcard). However, wait: the problem says a fixed boot (from left) can match a right boot that is either the same fixed color or a wildcard. But we have already considered the same fixed color in Step 1, and the remaining fixed boots (in A) have no corresponding fixed boots (of the same color) in the right (because we matched as many as we could). However, the remaining fixed boots in the right (B) are of various colors, and the left fixed boot (from A) is of a specific color. But note: the left fixed boot (color c) can match any right boot (whether fixed or wildcard). So the left fixed boot (c) can match:\n\n                        - Any right boot that is fixed (any color) OR wildcard.\n\n                    Similarly, the left wildcard (C) can match any right boot (fixed or wildcard).\n\n                Therefore, the bipartite graph for the leftovers is complete? Actually, yes: \n\n                    - A node in A (left fixed) can match any node in B (right fixed) and any node in D (right wildcard).\n                    - A node in C (left wildcard) can match any node in B (right fixed) and any node in D (right wildcard).\n\n                So the graph is complete from Left (A ∪ C) to Right (B ∪ D). Then, the maximum matching in this bipartite graph is min(|A|+|C|, |B|+|D|).\n\n                However, wait: we are allowed to form a matching that uses any edge. Then the maximum pairs we can form from the leftovers is min(|A|+|C|, |B|+|D|). But note: we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n                But is that the entire story? Actually, we are allowed to form pairs arbitrarily. So the maximum pairs from the leftovers is min(|A|+|C|, |B|+|D|).\n\n            Therefore, total pairs = (sum over colors c of min(L[c], R[c])) + min(|A|+|C|, |B|+|D|)\n\n            However, wait: let me verify.\n\n            Example: \n                n=2, l=\"a?\", r=\"?a\"\n\n                Step 1: \n                    For color 'a': min(L['a']=1, R['a']=1) -> 1 pair from fixed-to-fixed? But wait, the left boot is \"a?\" (so first is 'a', second is '?') and right boot is \"?a\" (first is '?', second is 'a').\n\n                Actually, we have two boots. We can form one pair: either (left0, right1) or (left1, right0). \n\n                But according to our Step 1: \n                    We consider fixed-to-fixed: \n                        left0: 'a' -> so we look for right boots with 'a' or '?'? Actually, we are only counting fixed-to-fixed for same color. For color 'a', we have one left and one right. So we can form one fixed-to-fixed pair for 'a'. Then the leftover fixed boots: \n                            Left: none (because we used the 'a' in the left)\n                            Right: none (because we used the 'a' in the right)\n                            LeftWild: [index1] (the '?' in left)\n                            RightWild: [index0] (the '?' in right)\n\n                Then Step 2: we can form min(0+1, 0+1)=1 additional pair? That would give total 2 pairs. But n=2, so we cannot form two pairs because we have two boots per side? Actually, we have two left boots and two right boots. Each pair uses one left and one right. So maximum two pairs? \n\n                However, the example input: \n                    n=2, left=\"a?\", right=\"?a\"\n\n                We can form two pairs: \n                    Pair1: left0 (color 'a') with right1 (color 'a') -> valid.\n                    Pair2: left1 (color '?') with right0 (color '?') -> valid.\n\n                But wait, the example input says: \n                    Input: \n                        2\n                        a?\n                        ?a\n\n                Then our Step 1: \n                    For color 'a': min(L['a']=1, R['a']=1) -> 1 pair. Then leftover fixed boots: \n                        LeftFixedLeft: [] (because we used the only 'a' in left)\n                        RightFixedLeft: [] (because we used the only 'a' in right)\n                        LeftWild: [1] (the second left boot)\n                        RightWild: [0] (the first right boot)\n\n                Then Step 2: min(1,1)=1, so total pairs=2.\n\n                But wait, we have two pairs. However, we must assign the boots without conflict. In the example, we have two left boots and two right boots. We used the left0 and right1 for the fixed part. Then the remaining left1 and right0 are both wildcards and can form a pair.\n\n                However, note: the fixed part matched (0,1): meaning left0 with right1. Then the wild part matched (1,0): left1 with right0. This is valid.\n\n            But now, consider if we had:\n\n                n=2, left=\"a?\", right=\"aa\"\n\n                Step 1: \n                    For color 'a': min(1,2)=1 -> so we use one fixed pair. Then leftover:\n                        LeftFixedLeft: [] (left0 used, left1 is wildcard)\n                        RightFixedLeft: [1] (one right boot with 'a' remains)\n                        LeftWild: [1]\n                        RightWild: []\n\n                Then Step 2: min(1,1)=1, so total 2 pairs.\n\n                The pairs: \n                    Fixed: (left0, right0) OR (left0, right1)? Actually, we have two choices for the fixed part. We can choose to match left0 with either right0 or right1. Then the remaining left1 (wild) and the remaining right boot (if we matched left0 with right0, then remaining right is right1 which is 'a' -> fixed. Then we can match left1 (wild) with right1 (fixed) -> valid. Similarly, if we matched left0 with right1, then the remaining right0 is 'a' and we match left1 (wild) with right0.\n\n            However, the matching in Step 1 must be chosen carefully so that the leftover sets are as balanced as possible? Actually, the formula for the fixed part is independent: we are just counting the maximum fixed-to-fixed pairs, which is the sum over colors of min(L[c], R[c]). But note: the same boot is not repeated. And the matching for fixed part is a standard multi-set matching.\n\n            Then, the leftover fixed boots are:\n\n                For each color c, the leftover left fixed boots for color c: max(0, L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n                Similarly, the leftover right fixed boots for color c: max(0, R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n\n            Then, the total leftover fixed boots (left) is the sum over c of max(0, L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), and similarly for the right.\n\n            Then, the wildcards:\n\n                Total left wildcards: n - (number of left fixed boots) = n - (sum_c L[c])\n                Similarly, total right wildcards: n - (sum_c R[c])\n\n            Then, the Step 2: we have to subtract the wildcards that were used in the fixed part? Actually, no: we didn't use any wildcard in the fixed part. The fixed part only uses fixed boots.\n\n            But wait: in Step 1, we used only fixed boots. The wildcards are untouched.\n\n            Then, the leftover wildcards are:\n\n                LeftWild = n - (sum_c L[c])   [because initially, the left fixed boots are the non '?' ones]\n                RightWild = n - (sum_c R[c])\n\n            However, note: the fixed part matching does not use wildcards, so the wildcards remain.\n\n            Then, the total pairs from Step 2 is min( (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild), (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild) ) ?\n\n            Wait, no: because in Step 2, the left side has two types: the leftover_fixed_left and the LeftWild. Similarly, the right side has leftover_fixed_right and RightWild.\n\n            The maximum matching from Step 2 is the minimum of (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild) and (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild)? Actually, no: because we are matching from the entire left (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild) to the entire right (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild). Since the graph is complete, the maximum matching is min(leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild, leftover_fixed_right + RightWild).\n\n            But note: the leftover_fixed_left is the number of left boots that are fixed and not matched, and LeftWild is the number of left boots that are '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\n            However, we must ensure that we are not double-counting. The total left boots is n = (sum_c L[c] + LeftWild). Similarly, n = (sum_c R[c] + RightWild).\n\n            Then, the total pairs from Step 2 is min( (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild), (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild) ).\n\n            Then total pairs = (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])) + min( (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild), (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild) )\n\n            But note: the leftover_fixed_left is the total left fixed boots minus the ones we used. And the LeftWild is n - (total left fixed boots). Similarly, for the right.\n\n            However, wait: the total left boots is n, and we used (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])) pairs from the fixed part. But note: in the fixed part, we used as many left fixed boots as the number of pairs we formed (which is the sum over c). Similarly, for the right.\n\n            Then, the leftover_fixed_left = (total left fixed boots) - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c]))? Not exactly: because the fixed part for color c uses min(L[c], R[c]) left boots. So the total left fixed boots used is (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])). Then, the leftover_fixed_left = (total left fixed boots) - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])).\n\n            Similarly, leftover_fixed_right = (total right fixed boots) - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])).\n\n            Then, Step 2: the left side has (leftover_fixed_left + LeftWild) = ( (total left fixed boots) - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])) ) + (n - total left fixed boots) = n - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c]))\n\n            Similarly, the right side has (leftover_fixed_right + RightWild) = n - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c]))\n\n            Therefore, the maximum pairs from Step 2 is n - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])).\n\n            Then total pairs = (sum_c min(L[c], R[c])) + (n - (sum_c min(L[c], R[c]))) = n.\n\n            That cannot be: because we are saying we can form n pairs. But wait, we have n left and n right, so maximum n pairs. However, is that always achievable?\n\n            Example: \n                n=2, left=\"??\", right=\"??\"\n                Then, Step 1: fixed part: 0 (because no fixed colors). Then Step 2: min(2,2)=2. So total pairs=2. That is correct.\n\n            Example 2: \n                n=2, left=\"a?\", right=\"?a\"\n                Step 1: fixed part for 'a': min(1,1)=1. Then Step 2: min( (1-1+1) , (1-1+1) ) = min(1,1)=1. Then total pairs=2.\n\n            Example 3: \n                n=2, left=\"a?\", right=\"aa\"\n                Step 1: fixed part for 'a': min(1,2)=1. Then Step 2: left side: leftover_fixed_left = (1) - 1 = 0; LeftWild=1; so left total=1. Right side: leftover_fixed_right = (2) - 1 = 1; RightWild=0; so right total=1. Then min(1,1)=1. Total=2.\n\n            Example 4:\n                n=2, left=\"a?\", right=\"?b\"\n                Step 1: fixed part for 'a': min(1,0)=0; for 'b': min(0,1)=0. Then Step 2: left total = (1 left fixed) + (1 wild) = 2; right total = (1 fixed) + (1 wild) = 2. Then Step 2: 2 pairs. But wait, can we form 2 pairs?\n\n                We have:\n                    left0: 'a' (fixed)\n                    left1: '?' (wild)\n\n                    right0: '?' (wild)\n                    right1: 'b' (fixed)\n\n                We can form:\n                    left0 (a) with right1 (b) -> invalid (different fixed colors)\n                    left0 (a) with right0 (?) -> valid\n                    left1 (?) with right1 (b) -> valid\n\n                So we can form two pairs: (0,0) and (1,1). But wait: (0,0) is left0 with right0, and (1,1) is left1 with right1.\n\n                However, according to our Step 1, we didn't form any fixed-to-fixed pair. Then Step 2: we have two left and two right, so we can form two pairs. But note: the fixed-to-fixed part didn't use any, but the wild part used two pairs.\n\n            However, wait: the above reasoning for Step 2: we said the graph is complete. But in Example 4, the left0 (fixed 'a') can only be matched with a right boot that is 'a' or '?'. The right boots: one is '?' and one is 'b'. So left0 can only be matched with right0 (because 'b' is not 'a'). Similarly, left1 (wild) can be matched with both. And for the right side: right0 (wild) can be matched with any left boot (both left0 and left1). right1 (fixed 'b') can be matched with a left boot that is 'b' or '?'. The left boots: left0 is 'a' (so not 'b') and left1 is '?'. So right1 can only be matched with left1.\n\n            Then the graph:\n\n                left0: [right0]   (because right0 is '?' and right1 is 'b' -> not compatible for left0)\n                left1: [right0, right1]\n\n                right0: [left0, left1]\n                right1: [left1]\n\n            Then, the maximum matching is 2: \n                We can match left0 with right0, and left1 with right1.\n\n            But note: our Step 2 assumed a complete bipartite graph. Why did we assume complete? Because we thought a fixed boot (left0) can match any right boot (including fixed ones) as long as the right boot is the same fixed color or wildcard. But wait, the definition:\n\n                - An indefinite color (wildcard) is compatible with any.\n                - Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same.\n\n            So the rule is:\n\n                left0 (fixed 'a') can match:\n                    - right boot with color 'a' (fixed) -> but there isn't one.\n                    - right boot with color '?' -> yes.\n\n                left0 cannot match right1 (fixed 'b') because 'a' != 'b'.\n\n            Similarly, left1 (wildcard) can match any.\n\n            Therefore, the graph is not complete for the fixed boots: a fixed boot can only match the boots (on the right) that are either the same fixed color or wildcard.\n\n            But wait: the right side has fixed boots of different colors. So we cannot form an edge from a fixed left boot to a fixed right boot of a different color.\n\n            Then our assumption that the graph is complete for the leftover part is incorrect.\n\n            Correction:\n\n            In the leftover part, we have:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    A: left fixed boots (each has a fixed color c)\n                    C: left wildcards\n\n                Right nodes:\n                    B: right fixed boots (each has a fixed color d)\n                    D: right wildcards\n\n            Then, edges:\n\n                - A node in A (color c) can connect to:\n                    - Right nodes in D (wildcards) -> yes.\n                    - Right nodes in B: only if the right boot's fixed color d is c? Actually, no: because the fixed boot (left) of color c can match a fixed boot (right) of color c. But wait: we already did the fixed-to-fixed matching for color c in Step 1. And we matched min(L[c], R[c]) for each color. Then, the remaining fixed boots (left) for color c is L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]), and the remaining fixed boots (right) for color c is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]). \n\n                However, note: we might have leftover fixed boots of color c on the left, but no leftover fixed boots of color c on the right. Then, the left fixed boot (c) cannot match the right fixed boots (unless they are of color c, but there are none). But wait, the rule says: two specific colors must be the same. So the left fixed boot (c) can only match a right boot that is fixed and color c OR a wildcard.\n\n                Therefore, the left fixed boot (c) can only match:\n\n                    - Right boots that are fixed and color c: but we've already matched all the available fixed boots of color c (because we matched min(L[c], R[c]) and then the remaining right fixed boots of color c is 0). \n                    - Or right boots that are wildcards.\n\n                Similarly, a left wildcard can match any right boot (fixed or wildcard).\n\n                And for the right side:\n\n                    A node in B (fixed color d) can be matched by:\n\n                        - Left boots that are fixed and color d: but we've already matched all the fixed boots of color d (on the left) OR if there are leftover fixed boots of color d on the left? Actually, no: we matched min(L[d], R[d]) and the leftover left fixed boots of color d is L[d]-min(L[d], R[d]). But note: the right side has a fixed boot of color d, so we can use it to match with a left fixed boot of color d if there is one left? \n\n                However, wait: in Step 1, we matched for each color independently. We did not leave any fixed boot of color d unmatched on the left if there was a fixed boot of color d on the right that wasn't matched? Actually, no: we matched as many as the minimum. So if we have L[d] = 3 and R[d] = 2, then we matched 2 left boots (of color d) and 2 right boots (of color d). Then we have 1 left boot of color d leftover, and 0 right boots of color d leftover. Then the left boot of color d can be matched with a wildcard on the right.\n\n            So the edges for the leftover part:\n\n                Left fixed boot (color c) can match:\n\n                    - Right wildcards (any)\n                    - Right fixed boots of color c? Only if there is a right fixed boot of color c that was not matched in Step 1. But by our Step 1, we matched all the right fixed boots of color c (because we matched min(L[c], R[c]) and if R[c] < L[c] then we matched all R[c] and there are no right fixed boots of color c left). \n\n                However, wait: we did not necessarily match all the fixed boots of a color. We matched min(L[c], R[c]) for color c. Then, the leftover right fixed boots of color c is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]). This is positive if R[c] > L[c]. Then, we can use the left fixed boot of color c to match the remaining right fixed boots of color c? \n\n                But note: in Step 1, we only matched the minimum. Then, we did not use all the left fixed boots of color c if R[c] < L[c]? Actually, we matched R[c] (all the right fixed boots of color c) and then we have L[c]-R[c] left fixed boots of color c. Then, these left fixed boots of color c can be matched with the right fixed boots of color c? But wait, we don't have any right fixed boots of color c left (because we used all R[c]). \n\n                Therefore, the left fixed boot of color c (that is leftover) can only be matched with a wildcard on the right.\n\n            Similarly, a right fixed boot of color d (leftover) can only be matched with a left wildcard or a left fixed boot of color d (if there is one). But wait: we don't have any left fixed boot of color d (because we matched min(L[d], R[d]) and then the leftover left fixed boots of color d is L[d]-min(L[d], R[d]) = L[d] - min(L[d], R[d]) = max(0, L[d]-R[d]). And note: if R[d] > L[d], then the leftover right fixed boots of color d is R[d]-L[d], and then we can match these with left wildcards.\n\n            Therefore, the bipartite graph for the leftover part is:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    - A: left fixed boots (each has a color c) -> can only match right wildcards (if there are no right fixed boots of color c left) OR actually, wait: what if there are right fixed boots of color c left? \n\n                Let me reexamine: \n\n                After Step 1, for a color c:\n\n                    We matched min(L[c], R[c]) pairs. Then, the leftover left fixed boots of color c is L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]).\n                    The leftover right fixed boots of color c is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]).\n\n                Then, for a left fixed boot of color c (leftover):\n\n                    It can match a right boot if the right boot is:\n                        1. A right boot of color c (if there is any leftover right fixed boot of color c) OR\n                        2. A right boot that is wildcard.\n\n                But wait: the rule says a fixed color c can match a fixed color c or a wildcard. So if there is a right fixed boot of color c left, then that is allowed.\n\n                Similarly, for a right fixed boot of color c (leftover):\n\n                    It can match a left boot if the left boot is:\n                        1. A left boot of color c (if there is any leftover left fixed boot of color c) OR\n                        2. A left boot that is wildcard.\n\n            Therefore, the bipartite graph is not complete. We have to build edges conditionally.\n\n            This means our initial complete graph assumption was too optimistic.\n\n            Given the complexity of building the graph (n=150000) and the fact that we have 26 colors, we need to use the color information to guide the matching.\n\n            Alternative plan:\n\n            We are going to do two phases:\n\n            Phase 1: Match fixed boots of the same color (Step 1). We do this by iterating over colors and matching the fixed boots.\n\n            Phase 2: Then, we have to match the remaining fixed boots (if any) with wildcards, and then match the remaining wildcards with each other and with the other fixed boots.\n\n            But note: the remaining fixed boots (left) of color c can be matched with:\n\n                - Right wildcards\n                - Right fixed boots of color c (if any) -> but wait, we already matched the fixed boots of color c as much as possible, so the remaining fixed boots of color c on the right are zero? \n\n            Let me clarify: \n\n                In Step 1, we matched min(L[c], R[c]) for color c. Then, the leftover for color c on the left is L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) = max(0, L[c]-R[c]).\n                The leftover for color c on the right is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) = max(0, R[c]-L[c]).\n\n            Now, the left fixed boot of color c (leftover) can match a right fixed boot of color c (leftover) because the rule allows two specific colors to match if they are the same. However, we did not use the fixed-to-fixed matching for the leftover part. But why not? Because we matched as many as possible for color c. The leftover left fixed boots of color c and leftover right fixed boots of color c are not matched in Step 1, but they are of the same color. So they are compatible.\n\n            Then, we can form additional fixed-to-fixed pairs in the leftover part? \n\n            Example: \n                n=3, l=\"aaa\", r=\"aaa\"\n                Step 1: for color 'a', min(3,3)=3. Then no leftovers. Total pairs=3.\n\n            Example:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be identical, while an indefinite color (denoted by '?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors. The key observation is that fixed colors (non '?') can only match other fixed colors of the same type or wildcards ('?'), while wildcards can match any color. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs efficiently.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match as many fixed colors as possible between left and right boots for each color. This is done by iterating over each color and pairing the minimum of left and right occurrences.\n   - **Phase 2**: Use the remaining wildcards and unmatched fixed boots to form additional pairs. Here, wildcards can match any remaining boots (fixed or wildcard), and unmatched fixed boots can only match wildcards if no corresponding fixed boots are left.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Phase 1** uses a greedy approach to count and match fixed color pairs for each color independently.\n   - **Phase 2** leverages the fact that wildcards can match any boot, so the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining boots on the left and right sides after Phase 1.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each color (up to 26) and each boot once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 150000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    right_fixed = []\n    left_wild = []\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i, (lc, rc) in enumerate(zip(l_str, r_str)):\n        if lc != '?' and rc != '?':\n            if lc == rc:\n                left_fixed.append(i+1)\n                right_fixed.append(i+1)\n            else:\n                left_fixed.append(i+1)\n                right_fixed.append(i+1)\n        elif lc == '?':\n            left_wild.append(i+1)\n        elif rc == '?':\n            right_wild.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed.append(i+1)\n            right_fixed.append(i+1)\n    \n    fixed_matches = 0\n    color_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in l_str:\n        if c != '?':\n            color_count[c] += 1\n    for c in r_str:\n        if c != '?':\n            color_count[c] += 0\n    \n    left_fixed_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for i in range(len(left_fixed)):\n        color_index = left_fixed[i] - 1\n        c = l_str[color_index]\n        if c != '?':\n            left_fixed_counts[c] += 1\n            \n    right_fixed_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for i in range(len(right_fixed)):\n        color_index = right_fixed[i] - 1\n        c = r_str[color_index]\n        if c != '?':\n            right_fixed_counts[c] += 1\n            \n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        if c in left_fixed_counts and c in right_fixed_counts:\n            m = min(left_fixed_counts[c], right_fixed_counts[c])\n            fixed_matches += m\n            \n    total_left = len(left_fixed) + len(left_wild)\n    total_right = len(right_fixed) + len(right_wild)\n    wildcard_matches = min(total_left, total_right)\n    total_pairs = fixed_matches + wildcard_matches\n    \n    print(total_pairs)\n    \n    result_pairs = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        l_list = []\n        for idx in left_fixed:\n            pos = idx - 1\n            if l_str[pos] == c:\n                l_list.append(idx)\n        r_list = []\n        for idx in right_fixed:\n            pos = idx - 1\n            if r_str[pos] == c:\n                r_list.append(idx)\n        l_list.sort()\n        r_list.sort()\n        m = min(len(l_list), len(r_list))\n        for i in range(m):\n            result_pairs.append((l_list[i], r_list[i]))\n            used_left.add(l_list[i])\n            used_right.add(r_list[i])\n            \n    left_remaining = []\n    for idx in left_fixed:\n        if idx not in used_left:\n            left_remaining.append(idx)\n    for idx in left_wild:\n        left_remaining.append(idx)\n    left_remaining.sort()\n        \n    right_remaining = []\n    for idx in right_fixed:\n        if idx not in used_right:\n            right_remaining.append(idx)\n    for idx in right_wild:\n        right_remaining.append(idx)\n    right_remaining.sort()\n        \n    for i in range(min(len(left_remaining), len(right_remaining))):\n        result_pairs.append((left_remaining[i], right_remaining[i]))\n    \n    for a, b in result_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of boots and the strings representing left and right boot colors.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into fixed (specific colors) and wildcards ('?').\n3. **Fixed Color Matching**: For each color, the algorithm counts and matches the minimum of left and right fixed boots.\n4. **Wildcard Matching**: The remaining boots (both fixed and wildcards) are matched based on availability, with wildcards matching any remaining boot.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices, ensuring no boot is reused.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible boot pairs by leveraging greedy matching for fixed colors and flexible matching for wildcards.",
