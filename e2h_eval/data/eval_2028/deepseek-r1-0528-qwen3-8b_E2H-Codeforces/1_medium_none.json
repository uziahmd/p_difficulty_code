    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The border of an (a x b) rectangle has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is at least 1x1, then the border is: \n        top and bottom: each row has b cells, but wait: actually for a rectangle of a rows and b columns, the border is:\n        top: b, bottom: b, left and right: (a-2) for each? Actually, no: the entire border is 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that if the rectangle has only 1 cell (a=1, b=1) then the border is 1, but by the formula above: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> that doesn't work.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For an a x b rectangle, the border (if we consider the outer layer) is:\n   - The top row: b cells.\n   - The bottom row: b cells.\n   - The two middle rows: each row has 2 cells (the leftmost and rightmost).\n\n So total = b (top) + b (bottom) + (a-2)*2 (the sides without top and bottom) \n   = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, when a=1 and b=1: then 2*1+2*1-4 = 0, which is incorrect. However, note the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is w x h). And the plate is at least 3x3.\n\n Also note the condition: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So the inner rectangles will not be negative.\n\n However, we must consider that the ring is defined by the border of the inner rectangle. But if the inner rectangle becomes too small, we might have to adjust?\n\n Actually, the problem states: the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n But note: the ring has width 1. So the entire ring is the set of cells that form the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n Conditions for the ring to exist: \n   The inner rectangle must have positive dimensions. The problem ensures k is within the limit so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is non-negative.\n\n However, note: the formula for the border of a rectangle a x b is:\n   If a >= 1 and b >= 1, then:\n     If a == 1 and b == 1: then border = 1.\n     Otherwise, the border is 2*a + 2*b - 4, but wait, let me check:\n\n Example: 3x3: \n   Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 -> which matches the example.\n\n Example: 1x1: \n   We cannot use 2*1+2*1-4 because that gives 0. But note: our k is constrained so that the inner rectangle for the first ring is w-0 and h-0, and then subtracting 4*(k-1). Since k>=1, the first ring is at least 3x3 (because w,h>=3). \n\n However, what if we have a rectangle that is 1x anything? Then the formula 2*a+2*b-4 would be 2*1+2*b-4 = 2*b -2. But in reality, for a 1xN rectangle, the border is N (the entire thing is the border). Similarly, for an Nx1 rectangle, it is N.\n\n But note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells, and we start with the edge. The rings are drawn by stepping inwards. The process stops when we don't have enough room (but k is bounded so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1? Actually, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n Let's check: \n   For the first ring: we require the inner rectangle is (w) x (h). Then the next ring requires w>=5 and h>=5? Because we subtract 4*(1) from both? Actually, the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). The condition for k is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: min(3,3)=3 -> (3+1)//4 = 4//4 = 1 -> valid.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: min(7,9)=7 -> (7+1)//4 = 8//4=2 -> valid.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=3: (7+1)//4=2, so k=3 is invalid.\n\n Therefore, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has dimensions (w - 4*(k-1)) x (h - 4*(k-1)), and since k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), we have that the inner rectangle for the last ring is at least 1x1.\n\n However, note: the condition is on the minimum dimension. The inner rectangle must have at least 1x1, but also the border formula must hold.\n\n But note: the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 works only when a>=2 OR b>=2? Actually, if a==1 and b>=1, then the border is just the entire rectangle, which is b. Similarly, if b==1 and a>=1, then the border is a. \n\n However, in our case, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring must have both dimensions at least 1 (since we subtract 4*(k-1) and k is bounded). But it is possible that one dimension becomes 1 and the other is greater than 1.\n\n How about: \n   Let a = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the number of cells in the i-th ring is:\n\n   If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n   Else if a == 1 or b == 1: then the rectangle is a single row/column, so the border is the entire rectangle: max(a, b) [but wait, if a==1 then the border is b, and if b==1 then the border is a]. Actually, if a==1, then the entire rectangle is a single row of b cells. Similarly, if b==1, then entire rectangle is a column of a cells.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n   Else if a == 1: then the border is b (because it's a single row, so the entire row is the border).\n   Else if b == 1: then the border is a.\n   Else: 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But note: the problem says the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. And the inner rectangle is defined by (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)).\n\n However, observe the process: \n   The first ring is the border of the original plate (w x h). Then the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 2 cells away, which has dimensions (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n But note: the problem does not say that the rings are drawn independently, but they are defined by these inner rectangles.\n\n Since k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), we know that for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has dimensions (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)) and both dimensions are at least 1.\n\n However, it is possible that one dimension is 1 and the other is more than 1. For example, w=5, h=3, k=1: \n   Then the inner rectangle for the first ring is 5x3. \n   Then the second ring would require w-4=1, h-4=-1 -> but k is bounded so that min(5,3)=3 -> (3+1)//4=1, so k=1 is allowed, k=2 is not.\n\n So in our computation, we only consider up to k rings, and for each ring i (from 1 to k) we compute:\n\n   a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the ring i has:\n   if a_i == 1 and b_i == 1: 1\n   elif a_i == 1: b_i   [because the entire rectangle is a single row]\n   elif b_i == 1: a_i   [because the entire rectangle is a single column]\n   else: 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4\n\n But wait, is that correct? Let me test with a_i=1 and b_i=2: then the rectangle is 1x2. The border should be the entire rectangle, which is 2. Our formula: if a_i==1, then output b_i (which is 2) -> correct.\n\n Another test: a_i=2, b_i=1: then the rectangle is 2x1. The border is the entire rectangle, which is 2 (the two cells). Our formula: if b_i==1, then output a_i (which is 2) -> correct.\n\n Now, what if a_i=2, b_i=2: then the rectangle is 2x2. The border: \n   top: 2, bottom: 2, and the two sides: (2-2)=0, so total 4. But by the formula: 2*2+2*2-4 = 8-4=4 -> correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the outer edge of the plate. In the example of 3x3, the first ring is 8. But according to the formula for a_i=3, b_i=3: 2*3+2*3-4 = 12-4=8 -> correct.\n\n But wait, what if the inner rectangle is 1x3? Then we output 3 (by the elif a_i==1: b_i). Is that correct? Yes, because a 1x3 rectangle has 3 cells and all are on the border.\n\n However, note that the problem defines the ring as the border of the inner rectangle. In the case of 1x3, the entire rectangle is the border.\n\n But here is a catch: the problem says \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\". This means that even if we have a very thin rectangle, we are only taking the outer layer (which is the entire rectangle). \n\n So the plan is:\n\n   Read w, h, k.\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        # Check if the current rectangle is 1x1, then add 1.\n        # But note: the condition for the ring to exist is that the inner rectangle is at least 1x1, which is guaranteed by k's bound.\n\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            # According to the problem, k is bounded so this shouldn't happen, but just in case we break?\n            break\n\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            total += 1\n        elif a == 1:\n            total += b\n        elif b == 1:\n            total += a\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   Print(total)\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n   w=3, h=3, k=1\n   i=1: a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4 = 8 -> total=8 -> matches.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n   i=1: a=7, b=9 -> else: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n   First ring: a=7, b=9 -> 28\n   Second ring: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> else: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12\n   total = 28+12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n However, note the example input provided was:\n   Input: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n   Output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n So we are good.\n\n But note: the problem says the rings are drawn from the edge inward. The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. The inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n However, we must ensure that the same cell is not being counted twice? Actually, the rings are defined on different inner rectangles, and they do not overlap because the second ring is entirely inside the first ring (leaving a gap of 2 cells between the first ring and the second). But note: the problem does not say that the rings are drawn consecutively without overlapping, but by definition the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle (which is 4 cells away from the original edges). \n\n The process is:\n\n   Original plate: 7x9\n   First ring: the border of 7x9 -> 28 cells.\n   Then we remove the outer frame of the first ring, and the next ring is the border of the remaining inner part, which is (7-2*2) x (9-2*2)? Actually, we subtract 4*(1) from both dimensions? Wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. That means we leave 1 cell on each side (so 2 on each side for the two rings) but wait, the problem says \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\", meaning the inner rectangle is reduced by 2*2 (because we go in two layers: one for the first ring and one for the second). \n\n However, note the formal definition: \n   The i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n So for i=1: 4*(0)=0 -> w x h.\n   for i=2: 4*(1)=4 -> (w-4) x (h-4).\n\n This matches the example.\n\n But wait, why subtract 4? Because the first ring uses the entire edge, so the next ring must start 2 cells in from each side (so 2 cells on the left and 2 on the top, etc.), which reduces the width and height by 4 (2 from the left and 2 from the right, so total 4).\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't need to worry about negative dimensions beyond the loop.\n\n But we did include a check for a<1 or b<1 to break. Since k is bounded, we might never break, but it's safe.\n\n Let me test with the example that has w=5, h=3, k=1 (which is allowed because (min(5,3)+1)//4 = (3+1)//4 = 1):\n\n   i=1: a=5, b=3 -> else: 2*5+2*3-4 = 10+6-4=12.\n\n   However, let's visualize a 5x3 plate:\n\n   The first ring is the outer border: \n        top row: 3 cells\n        bottom row: 3 cells\n        left and right: for the two middle rows (row1 and row2): each has 2 cells (the two ends) -> so 2 rows * 2 = 4.\n        total = 3+3+4 = 10.\n\n   But our formula gave 12.\n\n   What's wrong?\n\n   Let me recalc manually for 5x3:\n\n   The outer rectangle is 5x3.\n\n   The border: \n      top: 3\n      bottom: 3\n      left: from row1 to row3 (the rows are 0-indexed: row0 is top, row1, row2, row3, row4 is bottom) so the left side is column0 from row0 to row4 -> that's 5 cells? But wait, the border is the outer layer.\n\n   Actually, the standard way to compute the border of a grid is:\n\n        top: row0, columns0 to 2 -> 3\n        bottom: row4, columns0 to 2 -> 3\n        left: from row1 to row3, column0 -> 3 cells (because there are 3 rows in the middle: row1, row2, row3)\n        right: from row1 to row3, column2 -> 3 cells\n\n   Total: 3+3+3+3 = 12.\n\n   But wait, the example I thought was 10 was incorrect. \n\n   Why did I think 10? Maybe I thought the border was only the corners? No, the entire outer layer is the border.\n\n   So the correct count for 5x3 is 12.\n\n   Let me draw a 5x3 grid:\n\n        Row0: [X, X, X]\n        Row1: [X,   , X]\n        Row2: [X,   , X]\n        Row3: [X,   , X]\n        Row4: [X, X, X]\n\n   The X's are the border. Count the X's:\n\n        Row0: 3\n        Row1: 2\n        Row2: 2\n        Row3: 2\n        Row4: 3\n\n        Total: 3+2+2+2+3 = 12.\n\n   So the formula 2*a+2*b-4 for a=5, b=3: 2*5+2*3-4 = 10+6-4 = 12 is correct.\n\n   The mistake was in my manual calculation: I only considered the top and bottom and then the sides (without the corners) for the middle rows. Actually, the sides (left and right) include the corners? \n\n   The formula for the border of a rectangle (without any assumptions) is:\n\n        = 2*(a + b) - 4   [if we consider that the four corners are shared and we subtract the four corners that were double-counted?]\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute as:\n\n        top: b\n        bottom: b\n        left: a-2 (excluding the two corners already counted in top and bottom)\n        right: a-2\n\n        Total: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   So the formula holds for a>=2 and b>=2. But what if one of them is 1? Then the formula 2*a+2*b-4 would be negative or zero, which is not correct.\n\n   We already handled the cases when a==1 or b==1 separately.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate, and the plate is at least 3x3, so the first ring always has a>=3 and b>=3 (unless the plate is 3x3, then a=3,b=3). But what if the plate is 3x something? Then for the first ring: a=3, b=something (>=3). Then we use the else branch: 2*3+2*b-4 = 6+2*b-4 = 2*b+2.\n\n   Example: 3x5 -> 2*5+2 = 12.\n\n   But let's compute manually for 3x5:\n\n        top: 5\n        bottom: 5\n        left: 3-2 = 1 (from row1 to row1, column0) -> but wait, the left and right: actually the left side is the entire left column (3 rows) and the right side the entire right column (3 rows). But wait, the corners are already included in top and bottom.\n\n        Actually, the border for 3x5:\n\n        top: 5\n        bottom: 5\n        left: the middle row's left cell -> 1\n        right: the middle row's right cell -> 1\n\n        Total: 5+5+1+1 = 12.\n\n        Alternatively, by the formula: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12.\n\n   So the formula works.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Read the input, then:\n\n   w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            # Shouldn't happen by the problem's k constraint, but break to avoid negative.\n            break\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            total += 1\n        elif a == 1:\n            total += b\n        elif b == 1:\n            total += a\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, and the second ring is 2 cells away, etc. But what if k is 0? The problem states k>=1, so we don't have to handle k=0.\n\n Let me run the example from the problem:\n\n   Input: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n   Input: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n   Input: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   All match.\n\n   One more example: the provided example \"3 3 1\" is 3x3, which we did.\n\n   Example: \"5 3 1\" -> 12 (as above)\n\n   Example: \"5 3 2\" -> \n        k=2: first ring: a=5, b=3 -> 12\n        second ring: a=5-4=1, b=3-4=-1 -> wait, negative? \n\n        Condition: k is bounded by floor((min(5,3)+1)/4) = (3+1)//4 = 1, so k=2 is not allowed. \n\n        Therefore, we are safe because the input k is always within the bound.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"1 ≤ k ≤ floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\".\n\n   So we don't need to worry about negative dimensions in the input.\n\n   However, our code checks for negative and breaks. This is a safeguard.\n\n   We'll submit the code as below.\n\n   Note: There's another way to compute the border without conditionals for the entire rectangle: \n\n        border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   if a>=2 and b>=2, but if either is 1 then we use the entire length.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if a == 1:\n            area = b\n        elif b == 1:\n            area = a\n        else:\n            area = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   But wait, what if a==1 and b==1? Then the above if-elif catches the first condition and uses b (which is 1) -> then we get 1, which is correct.\n\n   Actually, we can simplify:\n\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            area = a * b   # because if a==1 then it's 1*b, if b==1 then it's a*1, and if both are 1 then 1.\n        else:\n            area = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   But wait, if a==1 and b==5, then a*b=5, which is correct (the entire rectangle is the border). Similarly, if a==5 and b==1, then 5*1=5, correct. And if both are 1, then 1*1=1, correct.\n\n   However, is that true? The entire rectangle is the border only if one of the dimensions is 1. And if both are 1, then the border is 1 (the entire rectangle). \n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if a <= 1 or b <= 1:\n            # Actually, if one of them is 1, then the entire rectangle is the border. But note: if a=0 or b=0, that's invalid (we break above). \n            # But we broke if a<1 or b<1. Now, if a==1 or b==1, then we use the product.\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   However, wait: if a=1 and b=1, then we use a*b=1, which is correct. But what if a=1 and b=0? Then we break above because b<1. So in our loop we break if negative, and then we are handling nonnegative a and b (at least 1).\n\n   But note: the problem bounds ensure we don't get negative. However, we break if negative. But if we get a=1 and b=0, that's invalid and we break. \n\n   However, the condition is a<1 or b<1. We break then. So in the else part, we assume a>=1 and b>=1.\n\n   But wait, if we break when a<1 or b<1, then in the rest we have a>=1 and b>=1.\n\n   Then we can use:\n\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            area = a * b\n        else:\n            area = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   But wait, if a==1 and b==5, then area=5, which is correct. And if a==5 and b==1, then area=5, correct. And if a==2 and b==2, then 2*2+2*2-4=4, which is correct.\n\n   However, is the border of a 1x5 rectangle 5? Yes. And the border of a 2x2 rectangle is 4? Yes.\n\n   But wait, the border of a 2x2 rectangle: \n        top: 2\n        bottom: 2\n        left: 0 (because top and bottom already took the corners) -> wait, no: the standard way to compute the border of a 2x2 is 4 (each cell is a border). \n\n   Actually, the border of a 2x2 is 4 because every cell is on the border.\n\n   However, our formula 2*2+2*2-4 = 4+4-4=4, correct.\n\n   But wait, the alternative method (using a*b) only applies when at least one dimension is 1. \n\n   So the code can be simplified.\n\n   However, let me check the example 3x1:\n\n        a=3, b=1 -> then we use a*b=3, which is correct.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so we won't get 3x1 in the input? Actually, the input w and h are at least 3, but then we subtract 4*(k-1). \n\n   Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: 3x3 -> else branch: 2*3+2*3-4=8.\n\n   Example: w=3, h=3, k=2: \n        k is bounded by floor((min(3,3)+1)/4)= (3+1)//4=1, so k=2 is invalid.\n\n   Example: w=5, h=3, k=1: 5x3 -> else branch: 2*5+2*3-4=12.\n\n   Example: w=5, h=3, k=2: invalid because (min(5,3)+1)//4 = (3+1)//4=1.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   But note: the problem says w and h are at least 3, but after subtracting 4*(k-1) we might get one dimension to 1 and the other still >=3 (for the first ring) but wait, for the first ring we don't subtract anything, so both dimensions are at least 3. Then for the second ring, we subtract 4, so if w=3, then 3-4=-1 -> but k=2 is not allowed for w=3 because (min(3,3)+1)//4=1.\n\n   So we don't get negative.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the simplified version:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                break\n            if a == 1 or b == 1:\n                total += a * b\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n        \"3 3 1\": a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        \"7 9 1\": 2*7+2*9-4=28 -> correct.\n\n        \"7 9 2\": first ring: 28; second ring: a=3, b=5 -> 3>=2 and 5>=2? No, wait: 3>=2 -> yes, 5>=2 -> yes, so use else: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12; total=40 -> correct.\n\n        \"5 3 1\": a=5, b=3 -> else: 2*5+2*3-4=12 -> correct.\n\n        \"3 1 1\": This input is not allowed because w>=3 and h>=3, so h=1 is not allowed. But if we get such input, we break because h-0=1, then we use a*b=3*1=3. But the problem says h>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, the problem states: \"3 <= w, h <= 100\", so we are safe.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the border being a*b is when at least one dimension is 1. In the example above, we have a=3, b=1: that's a 3x1 rectangle, and the border is 3 (the entire column). But wait, the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so initially we have at least 3x3. Then we subtract 4*(i-1). \n\n   Example: w=3, h=4, k=1: \n        a=3, b=4 -> else: 2*3+2*4-4=6+8-4=10.\n\n   But if we subtract 4*(i-1) for k=2: \n        a=3-4=-1 -> break.\n\n   So we only do k=1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n   This is simpler and passes the examples.\n\n   However, note: the condition \"if a==1 or b==1\" covers the entire border being the whole rectangle. And the else branch is for when both are at least 2.\n\n   Let me test with a=1, b=1: \n        i=1: a=1, b=1 -> then we use a*b=1, correct.\n\n   But wait, what if a=2 and b=1? Then we use a*b=2, which is correct.\n\n   It's consistent.\n\n   We'll go with this.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the plate is at least 3x3, so initially we have a>=3 and b>=3. Then the first ring is computed with the else branch. Then the second ring: a = w-4, b=h-4. Since w>=3 and h>=3, but if w=3 then a=3-4=-1 -> then we break. But the bound on k ensures that the second ring only exists if w>=5 and h>=5 (because 3-4<0, so k=2 is not allowed for w=3). \n\n   So the code is safe.\n\n   Let me test with w=5, h=5, k=2:\n        i=1: a=5, b=5 -> else: 2*5+2*5-4=20-4=16.\n        i=2: a=5-4=1, b=5-4=1 -> then we use a*b=1, so total=17.\n\n   Now, manually: \n        First ring (5x5): \n            top:5, bottom:5, left:3 (rows1 to 3, col0), right:3 -> total=5+5+3+3=16.\n        Second ring (1x1): 1 cell.\n        Total=17.\n\n   But wait, the second ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (5-4)=1x1. The border of a 1x1 is 1.\n\n   However, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. For a 5x5 plate, the second ring would be the center cell? \n\n   Actually, the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 1x1. But the problem says the ring has a width of 1 cell. The border of a 1x1 is the entire cell. \n\n   But note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In a 5x5, the center cell is exactly 2 cells away from the edge (because from the top: 2 cells down, from the left: 2 cells right). \n\n   So the second ring is indeed the center cell.\n\n   Therefore, 17 is correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" was 40, which we got correctly.\n\n   Final code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the rings are drawn by the inner rectangle. The second ring is defined as the border of (w-4) x (h-4). In the 5x5 example, the inner rectangle is 1x1, so the border is 1.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Let me test with w=6, h=6, k=1:\n        a=6, b=6: 2*6+2*6-4=12+12-4=20.\n\n   Manually: \n        top:6, bottom:6, left:4 (rows1 to 4, col0), right:4 -> 6+6+4+4=20.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each ring has a width of 1 cell. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the number of cells in each ring formed by stepping inward from the edges of the plate. The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle derived from the original plate dimensions by reducing both width and height by multiples of 4 (since each step inward affects all four sides).\n2. **Insight**: For each ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are given by \\( w - 4(i-1) \\) and \\( h - 4(i-1) \\), where \\( i \\) is the ring number. The number of cells in the ring is the perimeter of this inner rectangle, adjusted for whether the rectangle degenerates to a single row or column.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If either dimension is 1, the entire rectangle is the border (i.e., the product of the dimensions). Otherwise, use the formula \\( 2a + 2b - 4 \\) to compute the border cells, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the dimensions of the inner rectangle.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(k) \\), which is efficient given the constraints (k is at most around 25 for the maximum plate size).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total += a * b\n        else:\n            total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting \\( 4(i-1) \\) from both width and height.\n3. **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes negative, break out of the loop as further rings would not be valid.\n4. **Calculate Cells**: If either dimension is 1, the entire rectangle is the border, so add the product of the dimensions to the total. Otherwise, use the formula \\( 2a + 2b - 4 \\) to compute the border cells.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and handling edge cases where the rectangle degenerates to a single row or column.",
