Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any newline characters) to get the expected letters.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the expected string and in the pile string.\n\n Alternatively, we can sort both the concatenated string and the third string (after stripping) and then compare.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'] -> YES\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings, but actually the input is three lines.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: ['PAPAINOEL', 'JOULUPUKKI', 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'] -> NO\n\n Why? Because the expected letters are from \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\", and the pile has \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n Actually, wait: the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Output: YES\n\n   Another example:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI   -> NO\n\n   And the third example:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> NO\n\n However, note the example input format: the third sample input is given as a list of three elements, but the actual input is three separate lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n   if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait: what if there are extra letters? Then the sorted(total_letters) and sorted(s3) would be different.\n\n However, the example 2: \n   s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n   total_letters = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Now, let's break down:\n\n   Expected letters: \n        P: 2, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 2, K: 1\n\n   In s3: \n        J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n   Wait, let me count:\n\n   s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> \n        J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n   But expected: \n        P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:1\n\n   So the counts don't match: \n        For 'U': expected 2, found 3 -> so it's more than expected.\n        For 'L': expected 1, found 3 -> too many.\n        For 'K': expected 1, found 2 -> too many.\n\n   Also, we have an extra letter 'N' (expected 1, found 1 is okay) and missing some? Actually, let's count the entire string:\n\n   Expected length: len(s1)+len(s2) = 9 + 11 = 20.\n   s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" has 20 letters? Let's count: \n        J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (frequency count) of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters required to form both names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines of input are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string representing all the required letters.\n3. **Check Letter Counts**: Compare the sorted list of characters from the combined names with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the required letters; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    required_letters = guest_name + host_name\n    \n    if sorted(required_letters) == sorted(pile_letters):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string `required_letters` which represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Checking Letter Counts**: The code sorts the characters of `required_letters` and `pile_letters`. If the sorted versions are identical, it means the pile has exactly the same letters as required, and the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts by leveraging sorting, which ensures that both the presence and quantity of each letter are verified. The solution handles all edge cases, including extra or missing letters, by comparing the sorted character lists directly.",
