The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Each round: \n   - If A[i] vs B[j] is a win for A, then no spot for A and none for B (or rather, the loser gets a spot).\n   - Otherwise, if B wins, then Polycarpus gets one red spot.\n\n The sequences A and B are given as strings, and we cycle through them.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot simulate round by round.\n 2. We need to consider the two sequences: A (length m) and B (length k). The game proceeds by taking the next element from A for Nikephororos and from B for Polycarpus, and then cycling.\n\n Idea:\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   Part 1: Count the total number of rounds that result in a loss for Nikephoros (i.e., when Polycarpus wins).\n   Part 2: Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n However, note that the outcome of a round depends on the pair (a, b) where a is from A and b from B.\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can consider the entire set of pairs (a_i, b_j) for i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1]. But note: the two sequences are played independently and in sync: the first round uses (A[0], B[0]), second (A[1], B[1]), etc.\n\n Actually, the two sequences are played simultaneously and the round index t (from 0 to n-1) uses:\n   A_t = A[t % m]\n   B_t = B[t % k]\n\n So we have to consider the alignment of the two cycles.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let T = n rounds.\n\n We can think of the entire game as having a common \"time\" t from 0 to n-1.\n\n But note: the two sequences have different periods, m and k. The combined period is the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k? However, n can be very large and m,k <= 1000, so LCM(m,k) might be up to about 1e6 (since 1000*1000/gcd(1000,1000)=1e6). But note: n can be up to 2e9, but the pattern of (A_t, B_t) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds. However, if we compute the entire pattern for LCM(m,k) rounds, then the total rounds n is just floor(n / LCM) full cycles plus a remainder.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the outcomes for all pairs (a, b) for a in ['R','S','P'] and b in ['R','S','P'].\n\n    According to rules:\n      Rock (R) beats Scissors (S): so if a='R' and b='S', then a wins -> no spot for a (but if a wins, then b loses -> so b gets a spot)\n      Similarly, we can define a function or table:\n\n        outcome(a, b):\n          if a == b: draw -> no spot for either.\n          else:\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','R'), ('S','P'), ('P','S'), ('P','R'), ('R','P')]:\n                Then we need to know who wins.\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n          a wins if: \n            (a == 'R' and b == 'S') OR\n            (a == 'S' and b == 'P') OR\n            (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\n        Then, if a wins: no spot for a (and b gets one)\n        Else (if b wins): a gets one spot (and no spot for b)\n\n        Note: if it's a draw, no spot for either.\n\n 2. We want to count for each round t (0-indexed) the outcome.\n\n    We can group the rounds by the pair (t % m, t % k). But note that the same (i, j) may appear at different times, but the condition for the outcome is determined solely by the pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n    However, the same (i, j) will occur periodically with period LCM(m,k). \n\n 3. How to count without iterating over n?\n\n    Let L = LCM(m, k). Then the entire set of pairs (i, j) for i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] will repeat every L rounds.\n\n    But note: the actual sequence of rounds is not by (i,j) independently but by time t: \n        i_t = t % m, j_t = t % k.\n\n    The condition for the outcome is determined by the pair (i_t, j_t). And the set of pairs (i_t, j_t) for t from 0 to L-1 is exactly the set of all pairs (i, j) with i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1]? Not exactly: because the mapping from t to (i,j) is such that i_t = t mod m and j_t = t mod k. This is equivalent to the Chinese Remainder Theorem conditions. However, note that the pairs (i,j) that occur are those for which there exists t such that t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k). Such t exists if and only if i ≡ j (mod gcd(m,k))? Actually, the set of pairs (i, j) that occur is exactly the set of (i, j) such that i ≡ j (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k)? \n\n    Alternatively, we can note that the pairs (i, j) that occur in the first L rounds (L = LCM(m,k)) are all pairs (i, j) such that i % (m) = i and j % (k) = j, and the condition is automatically satisfied by the definition of LCM. Actually, for each residue class modulo g (where g = gcd(m,k)), the pairs (i, j) must satisfy i ≡ j (mod g) to have a solution for t. But wait, we don't need to worry about that because we are going to iterate over the entire set of pairs (i, j) that satisfy i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] and then check if they appear.\n\n    Actually, the set of (i, j) that appear is the set of (i, j) such that i ≡ j (mod g) is not necessary because we are using modulus with m and k independently. In fact, the condition for a particular (i, j) to appear is that the equation t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k) has a solution. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this happens if and only if i ≡ j (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k). \n\n    But note: we are not required to consider the entire set of (i, j) for the entire game, but we are required to count the outcomes for the first n rounds.\n\n 4. Alternative approach:\n\n    Instead of using the LCM period, we can use the fact that the rounds can be broken down by the two independent cycles.\n\n    However, note that the round index t gives:\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n\n    We can also note that the pair (i, j) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds. Therefore, we can:\n\n        Let L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        Then, the first L rounds contain exactly one full period of the pairs (i, j) that occur? Actually, no: the set of pairs (i, j) that occur in L rounds is the set of all pairs (i, j) such that i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] and i ≡ j (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k))? \n\n    Actually, the set of pairs (i, j) that occur is not the entire grid (unless m and k are coprime). But we don't need to iterate over the entire grid.\n\n    Let me re-think: \n\n        For a fixed t, the pair (i, j) is (t % m, t % k). \n\n        The sequence of pairs (t % m, t % k) for t=0,1,..., L-1 is periodic with period L, and the set of distinct pairs is the set of (i, j) such that i ≡ j (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k))? \n\n    Actually, the condition for the system t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k) to have a solution is that i ≡ j (mod g). And the solutions for t are unique modulo L. Therefore, in the first L rounds, each pair (i, j) that satisfies i ≡ j (mod g) appears exactly once? \n\n    But note: the entire grid has m*k pairs, and the condition i ≡ j (mod g) reduces the grid. The number of pairs (i, j) that satisfy i ≡ j (mod g) is (m//g) * (k//g) * g? Actually, the number of solutions is LCM(m,k) = (m*k)//g. Wait, no: the set of pairs (i, j) that satisfy i ≡ j (mod g) is:\n\n        i = x, j = x + n*g, but then we must have x in [0, m-1] and x+n*g in [0, k-1] for some integer n? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        The set of pairs (i, j) that occur is the set of pairs (i, j) such that i % g == j % g. And the total number of such pairs is (m * k) / g? Actually, no: the condition i % g = j % g is independent for each residue r (0<=r<g). For residue r, the number of i in [0, m-1] with i % g = r is ceil(m/g) or floor(m/g)? Actually, it's (m+g-1)//g or m//g? \n\n    Actually, we don't need to know the exact set. We can precompute:\n\n        total_rounds = n\n\n        Let g = gcd(m, k)\n        L = (m * k) // g   # LCM\n\n        Then, the number of complete cycles = c = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        Now, in one complete cycle (L rounds), how many losses for Nikephoros and for Polycarpus?\n\n        We can create an array (or two arrays) for the entire cycle.\n\n        But note: the pairs (i, j) that occur in one cycle are the ones that satisfy i ≡ j (mod g). And they occur exactly once per cycle.\n\n        However, we don't know which pairs occur. But we can precompute the outcome for every possible (a, b) and then for each pair (i, j) we can compute the outcome.\n\n        But note: the entire grid (m x k) is too big? m, k <= 1000, so m*k <= 1e6, and we have at most 1e6 pairs. Then, we can iterate over the grid and then for each residue class (mod g) to count the outcomes for the entire cycle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute a dictionary or a list for the entire grid, but we don't need to store the entire grid, we can iterate over i in range(m) and j in range(k) and check the condition i ≡ j (mod g) to see if the pair (i, j) occurs. But note: the condition for occurrence is i ≡ j (mod g) and then we can count the outcome for that (i,j) and multiply by the number of times that (i,j) appears in the cycle? Actually, in one cycle, each qualifying (i,j) appears exactly once.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute g = gcd(m, k), L = (m*k)//g.\n\n        Step 2: Precompute a function to determine the outcome for a pair (a, b):\n\n            def outcome(a, b):\n                if a == b:\n                    return (0, 0)   # (spots for Nikephoros, spots for Polycarpus) -> no spot\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    return (0, 1)   # a wins, so b gets one spot\n                else:\n                    return (1, 0)   # b wins, so a gets one spot\n\n        Step 3: For the entire grid (i from 0 to m-1, j from 0 to k-1) we can check if (i % g == j % g) then the pair (i, j) occurs.\n\n        Then, the total losses for Nikephoros in one cycle is the sum of outcome(a_i, b_j)[0] for all (i, j) such that i % g == j % g.\n\n        Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n        Then, the total losses for Nikephoros in the complete cycles is: c * (sum over qualifying (i,j) of outcome(i,j)[0])\n\n        Similarly for Polycarpus: c * (sum over qualifying (i,j) of outcome(i,j)[1])\n\n        Step 4: Then, we have to account for the remaining 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1).\n\n        For these rounds, we iterate t from 0 to remainder-1:\n\n            i = t % m\n            j = t % k\n\n            Then, we check if (i % g == j % g) [actually, we don't need to check because we are only going to count the ones that occur? Actually, the condition for occurrence is necessary to know if the pair (i,j) is in the grid. But note: in the remaining rounds, the pair (i,j) might not satisfy the condition? Actually, the condition is inherent in the cycle: the pair (i,j) must satisfy i ≡ j (mod g) to appear. However, in the first L rounds, we have covered all pairs that satisfy the condition. The remaining rounds are the first 'remainder' rounds, which are a prefix of the cycle. We can simply simulate the remaining rounds because remainder < L, and L is at most 1e6, so we can iterate over remainder rounds.\n\n        But note: n can be up to 2e9, and L is at most 1e6, so remainder is less than 1e6. So we can iterate over the remainder rounds.\n\n        However, we can avoid simulating the entire remainder by noting that the remainder rounds are the first 'remainder' rounds. We can do:\n\n            total_cycle_spots_N = 0\n            total_cycle_spots_P = 0\n\n            # Precompute the cycle outcomes for all pairs that occur (each (i,j) with i % g == j % g) and then multiply by c.\n\n            Then, for the remainder, we can:\n\n            for t in range(remainder):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                # Check if (i % g == j % g) [this condition is always true for the pairs that occur in the cycle, but we are only considering the first 'remainder' rounds, which are part of the cycle. Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied for the pairs that are in the cycle, but the remainder rounds are the beginning of the cycle and the condition holds for the entire cycle? Actually, the condition i % g == j % g is necessary for the pair to appear, and we are generating the rounds in the order of the cycle. So we can simply compute the outcome for (i, j) without checking the condition because the remainder rounds are taken from the cycle.\n\n            However, wait: the condition i % g == j % g is not necessary to check for the outcome, because the outcome is defined by (a_i, b_j). But we must note: the outcome is defined by (a_i, b_j) regardless of the condition. The condition is just to know if the pair (i,j) appears in the cycle. But in our simulation of the remainder, we are just using the natural progression of the two cycles. The outcome is determined by (a_i, b_j) even if the pair (i,j) does not satisfy i % g == j % g? Actually, no: the pair (i,j) that do not satisfy i % g == j % g never occur. But wait, the way we generate the rounds is by t, and the condition for the pair (i,j) to occur is exactly i % g == j % g. However, in the remainder rounds, we are generating (t % m, t % k) for t from 0 to remainder-1. These rounds are the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle, and they are the ones that satisfy the condition? \n\n        Actually, the entire cycle is built by the condition: the round t is represented by (t%m, t%k) and the condition for existence is t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k) has a solution if and only if i ≡ j (mod g). But note: we are generating t from 0 to n-1, and the condition is automatically satisfied for the generated t? No, the generated t is increasing, and the condition i ≡ j (mod g) is a necessary condition for the system to have a solution. However, the system is defined by the two equations and t is the variable. But we are not solving for t, we are generating t and then computing i and j. The condition i % g == j % g is a consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem: since t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k), then i ≡ t (mod m) and j ≡ t (mod k). Then i ≡ j (mod g) because g divides both m and k, and hence divides any linear combination. Actually, the condition i ≡ j (mod g) is automatically satisfied for the generated (i, j) from t? \n\n        Proof: \n            Since t ≡ i (mod m) and t ≡ j (mod k), then i = t + a*m, j = t + b*k for some integers a,b.\n            Then i - j = a*m - b*k. Since g divides m and k, then g divides i-j, so i ≡ j (mod g).\n\n        Therefore, the condition is always satisfied for the generated (i, j) from t. So we don't need to check it.\n\n        Then, we can simply:\n\n            total_rounds = n\n            g = gcd(m, k)\n            L = (m * k) // g\n\n            c = total_rounds // L\n            rem = total_rounds % L\n\n            # Precompute the outcome for each pair (i, j) for i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] but only the ones that appear (which are all the ones that satisfy the condition, but we now know the condition is always satisfied for the generated (i,j) from t, but actually we are going to use the entire grid? \n\n        Wait, no: the entire grid is m*k pairs, but the cycle L is LCM(m,k) and the number of distinct pairs is L, which is (m*k)//g. But the grid has m*k pairs, and we are only using (m*k)//g of them. However, we are generating the rounds by t, and the mapping from t to (i,j) is a bijection between the set {0,1,...,L-1} and the set of pairs (i,j) that satisfy i ≡ j (mod g). \n\n        But note: the same (i,j) might appear multiple times? Actually, in the entire cycle of L rounds, each qualifying (i,j) appears exactly once.\n\n        Therefore, we can precompute:\n\n            base_N = 0\n            base_P = 0\n\n            for t in range(L):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j]\n                res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                base_N += res[0]\n                base_P += res[1]\n\n        Then, total_N = c * base_N + (simulated for t from 0 to rem-1: count the outcome for each round)\n\n        But wait, we already computed base_N and base_P for the entire cycle (L rounds). Then we can compute the remainder by:\n\n            rem_N = 0\n            rem_P = 0\n            for t in range(rem):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j]\n                res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                rem_N += res[0]\n                rem_P += res[1]\n\n            total_N = c * base_N + rem_N\n            total_P = c * base_P + rem_P\n\n        However, note: the entire cycle (L rounds) is built by t from 0 to L-1. And the remainder is from 0 to rem-1, so we are effectively simulating the first 'n' rounds.\n\n        But wait, we can also compute the remainder without a loop if we precomputed the outcomes for the first L rounds and stored them? But L is at most 1e6, and rem is less than L, so we can loop over rem.\n\n        However, note: rem is at most L-1, and L is at most 1e6, so rem is at most 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But we have two separate computations: one for the cycle (base_N, base_P) and one for the remainder (rem_N, rem_P). We are doing two loops: one over L (which is about 1e6) and one over rem (which is at most 1e6). This is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, we can combine the two loops: \n\n            We can compute the outcome for the first n rounds by:\n\n            total_N = 0\n            total_P = 0\n\n            # We break the rounds into two parts: the complete cycles and the remainder.\n            # Alternatively, we can iterate over t from 0 to n-1, but n can be 2e9.\n\n            But we did:\n\n            base_N = 0\n            base_P = 0\n            for t in range(L):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                ... compute outcome ...\n\n            Then, for the remainder, we do:\n\n            for t in range(rem):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                ... same ...\n\n            So we are doing two loops of length L and rem, respectively.\n\n        But note: we can also compute the entire cycle by iterating t from 0 to L-1, and then the remainder from 0 to rem-1. \n\n        However, we must note: the outcome function is defined for each (a,b). \n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n\n            Step 2: Compute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n            Step 3: Compute g = gcd(m, k) and L = (m * k) // g\n\n            Step 4: Define the outcome function.\n\n            Step 5: \n                base_N = 0\n                base_P = 0\n                # We can iterate t from 0 to L-1 for the cycle.\n                for t in range(L):\n                    i = t % m\n                    j = t % k\n                    a_char = A[i]\n                    b_char = B[j]\n                    res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                    base_N += res[0]\n                    base_P += res[1]\n\n            Step 6: \n                rem_N = 0\n                rem_P = 0\n                rem = n % L\n                # If rem is 0, then we don't need to add anything for the remainder.\n                for t in range(rem):\n                    i = t % m\n                    j = t % k\n                    a_char = A[i]\n                    b_char = B[j]\n                    res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                    rem_N += res[0]\n                    rem_P += res[1]\n\n            Step 7: \n                total_N = (n // L) * base_N + rem_N\n                total_P = (n // L) * base_P + rem_P\n\n            Print(total_N, total_P)\n\n 5. But wait: is the entire cycle (L rounds) the minimal period? Yes, because the state (i, j) is determined by t mod m and t mod k, and the state repeats when t increases by LCM(m,k). \n\n 6. However, note: we are counting the outcome for each round. The outcome is determined by (A[i], B[j]), and the cycle of states (i,j) is exactly L. \n\n 7. Example: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4, g = gcd(3,4)=1, L=12.\n\n        Then, we would compute base_N and base_P for 12 rounds, then n//12 = 0, and rem=7, so we simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\n        The example says: \n            Round0: R vs R -> draw -> (0,0)\n            Round1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses -> (1,0) [but wait: outcome for (P,S): \n                outcome('P','S'): \n                  P vs S: P wins? No: the rule: \n                    Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.\n                  P vs S: paper (P) vs scissors (S): according to the rule, scissors beat paper -> so S wins? Actually, wait: the rule says:\n                    Rock beats scissors -> so R beats S.\n                    Scissors beats paper -> so S beats P.\n                    Paper beats rock -> so P beats R.\n\n                So (P, S): P vs S -> S beats P? Because S beats P. So the outcome for (P, S) is (1,0) for Nikephoros (because he lost) and Polycarpus didn't get a spot.\n\n                But wait, our outcome function:\n\n                def outcome(a, b):\n                    if a == b: (0,0)\n                    elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: \n                        # This means if a wins, then we return (0,1) meaning a wins so b gets a spot.\n                        # But note: the condition above includes (P, R) -> that's P beats R, so if a='P' and b='R', then a wins.\n\n                But for (P, S): \n                    a='P', b='S'\n                    P != S -> not draw.\n                    Check: is (P, S) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]?\n                    No. Then we go to else: (1,0) -> meaning a loses (so Nikephoros loses, because a is from A) -> so (1,0) for (Nikephoros, Polycarpus): meaning Nikephoros gets 1 spot.\n\n                That matches.\n\n            Round2: S vs P -> outcome(S, P): \n                a='S', b='P'\n                S != P\n                Check: (S, P) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, because ('S','P') is there.\n                Then we return (0,1): meaning a wins (so S beats P) -> so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n            Round3: R vs P -> (R,P): \n                a='R', b='P'\n                R != P\n                (R, P) is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no.\n                Then (1,0): meaning a loses -> so (1,0) for Nikephoros.\n\n            Round4: P vs R -> (P,R): \n                a='P', b='R'\n                (P, R) is in the list -> returns (0,1)\n\n            Round5: S vs S -> (S,S): draw -> (0,0)\n\n            Round6: R vs P -> (R,P): same as round3 -> (1,0)\n\n            Total for Nikephoros: rounds1,3,6 -> 3\n            Total for Polycarpus: rounds2,4 -> 2\n\n            So the output is \"3 2\"\n\n        Now, let's simulate the first 7 rounds with our code:\n\n            n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n            m=3, k=4, g=1, L=12.\n\n            We do two loops: one for the cycle (12 rounds) and one for the remainder (7 rounds). But note: we only simulate the first 7 rounds in the remainder.\n\n            We can skip the cycle computation if n < L, then we only do the remainder.\n\n            But the code above does:\n\n                base_N, base_P for 12 rounds (from t=0 to 11) and then remainder from 0 to 6.\n\n            However, we don't need to compute the entire cycle if n < L. But the problem says n can be up to 2e9, so we must use the cycle method.\n\n            But note: if n < L, then we can simply simulate all rounds without breaking into cycles. However, we are breaking into cycles and remainder. The remainder is n % L, which is n if n < L.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                Let L = (m*k)//g\n\n                base_N = 0\n                base_P = 0\n                for t in range(L):\n                    i = t % m\n                    j = t % k\n                    a_char = A[i]\n                    b_char = B[j]\n                    res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                    base_N += res[0]\n                    base_P += res[1]\n\n                Then, for the remainder, we do:\n\n                rem = n % L\n                rem_N = 0\n                rem_P = 0\n                for t in range(rem):\n                    i = t % m\n                    j = t % k\n                    a_char = A[i]\n                    b_char = B[j]\n                    res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n                    rem_N += res[0]\n                    rem_P += res[1]\n\n            Then, total_N = (n // L)*base_N + rem_N, etc.\n\n            This works for any n.\n\n        However, note: the example n=7, and 7 < L (which is 12), so we only use the remainder loop and the cycle loop is done for 12 rounds (which is unnecessary). But 12 is small (<=1e6) so it's acceptable.\n\n        But what if n is very large? Then we do two loops: one of length L (which is up to 1e6) and one of length rem (which is < L). So worst-case, we do 2e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n 8. Edge: n=0 -> then no rounds, so output (0,0)\n\n 9.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of `LCM(m, k)` rounds and then handling the remaining rounds separately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Outcome Calculation**: For each round in the cycle, determine the outcome (who loses) based on the current moves from both sequences.\n   - **Efficient Counting**: Multiply the outcomes of one full cycle by the number of complete cycles in `n` rounds, then handle the remaining rounds individually.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves iterating over `LCM(m, k)` rounds once, which is feasible since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, making the LCM up to 1 million. The remaining rounds are processed in linear time, ensuring efficiency even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    B_str = data[2].strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n\n    def outcome(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    base_N = 0\n    base_P = 0\n    for t in range(L):\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n        a_char = A_str[i]\n        b_char = B_str[j]\n        res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        base_N += res[0]\n        base_P += res[1]\n\n    cycles = n // L\n    rem = n % L\n\n    rem_N = 0\n    rem_P = 0\n    for t in range(rem):\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n        a_char = A_str[i]\n        b_char = B_str[j]\n        res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        rem_N += res[0]\n        rem_P += res[1]\n\n    total_N = cycles * base_N + rem_N\n    total_P = cycles * base_P + rem_P\n\n    print(f\"{total_N} {total_P}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines: the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the cycle length `L`.\n3. **Outcome Function**: This function checks the result of each round based on the current moves from both sequences, returning a tuple indicating how many spots each player gets.\n4. **Base Cycle Processing**: For one full cycle (`L` rounds), the outcomes are counted to determine the total spots each player would get if the cycle repeats once.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: The remaining rounds after processing complete cycles are handled individually to account for any partial cycles.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The total spots for each player are computed by multiplying the base cycle counts by the number of complete cycles and adding the results from the remaining rounds.\n7. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
