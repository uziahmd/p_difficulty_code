Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can have any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x.\n\n 4. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum number k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each between -x and x) such that a1 + a2 + ... + ak = -S?\n\n 5. Note: We are allowed to choose any integers (positive, negative, or zero) as long as |a_i| <= x.\n\n 6. Since we want the minimum k, we can think greedily:\n\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n\n    - Otherwise, note that each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). But note: we can also mix positive and negative.\n\n    Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n    We need to represent the number T = -S as a sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x].\n\n    The maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x (if all are positive or all negative). However, we might not need to use the maximum if T is not too big.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x, x]. So we can choose any integer from -x to x for each card.\n\n    Conditions for k:\n\n      - The sum must be exactly T.\n\n      - The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x (by using all x's).\n      - The minimum sum is -k*x.\n\n    So we require: |T| <= k*x.\n\n    However, that condition is necessary but not sufficient. We must also be able to form T by adding k numbers each in [-x, x]. \n\n    But note: because we can use any integer in [-x, x], we can adjust the numbers arbitrarily as long as the total is T and the absolute value constraint holds.\n\n    How to find the minimum k?\n\n    We know k must be at least ceil(|T| / x) because even if we use all positive (or negative) cards, we need at least |T|/x cards (and since we can only use integers, we round up). However, we might do better by mixing? Actually, note:\n\n    Consider: we can use both positive and negative. But observe: if we use a positive and a negative, they might cancel out some of the total. However, we are trying to minimize the number of cards.\n\n    Actually, the key observation is: we can use a combination of positive and negative, but the minimal k must be at least the ceiling of |T|/x. Why?\n\n        Because the maximum absolute value we can add per card is x. So to cover a deficit (or surplus) of T (which is -S), we need at least ceil(|T| / x) cards.\n\n    However, let's check with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n          n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> S = (-1+1+2)=2, so T=-2.\n          Then ceil(|-2|/2)=ceil(2/2)=1 -> answer 1. This matches.\n\n      Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n          n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> S=-4, so T=4.\n          ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> answer 2. This matches.\n\n    But wait, what if T is zero? Then we don't need any card.\n\n    However, note: sometimes we might have a T that is divisible by x, then k_min = |T|//x (if T is positive or negative, we take absolute value).\n\n    But consider: what if T is not divisible by x? For example, T=5, x=2: then ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. Is 3 sufficient? \n        With 3 cards, the maximum absolute sum is 6, so we can represent 5: e.g., 2+2+1 (but wait, we can use any integer in [0,2] or [-2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the deficit or surplus from the current sum and determining how many cards are required to balance it out.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Deficit**: The target is to have a total sum of zero, so the additional cards must sum to the negative of the current sum (i.e., -S).\n3. **Check for Zero Deficit**: If the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimum number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the deficit divided by the maximum absolute value allowed on any card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most ±x towards balancing the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    deficit = -total_sum\n    \n    if deficit == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = abs(deficit) / x\n        ans = (k // 1) if k % 1 == 0 else (k // 1 + 1)\n        print(int(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the cards' values.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. This sum indicates how much more or less is needed to reach a total sum of zero.\n3. **Deficit Check**: The deficit is the negative of the sum. If the sum is zero, the answer is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimum number of cards required is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the deficit by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. This gives the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x` is at least as large as the absolute deficit, ensuring the sum can be balanced with `k` cards.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of cards needed by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ceiling division, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
