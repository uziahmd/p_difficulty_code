After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means having the highest mark in that subject).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? But note the problem says \"best\" if no student has a higher mark.\n    So, if two or more have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n However, note: we cannot simply take the maximum per subject because we need to know the maximum per subject and then check for each student if in at least one subject they have that maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Create a matrix (list of lists) of integers from the input strings.\n   - For each subject j (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student i, check if for any subject j, the student's mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\n But note: the input is given as strings of digits, so we can convert each character to an integer.\n\n However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, and the input is given without spaces.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n Let me break down the first example:\n\n   n=3, m=3\n   grades = [\n        [2,2,3],\n        [2,3,2],\n        [1,1,2]\n   ]\n\n   For subject0: max is 2 -> so student0 and student1 have 2 (so both are best in subject0)\n   For subject1: max is 3 -> only student1 has 3\n   For subject2: max is 3 -> student0 has 3? Actually wait: \n        subject0: [2,2,1] -> max=2\n        subject1: [2,3,1] -> max=3\n        subject2: [3,2,2] -> max=3\n\n   Now, for each student:\n        student0: [2,2,3] -> subject0: 2 (best) -> successful.\n        student1: [2,3,2] -> subject1: 3 (best) -> successful.\n        student2: [1,1,2] -> no subject where he is best (subject0: 1<2, subject1:1<3, subject2:2<3) -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the first line.\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines and split each line into a list of characters (or keep as string and convert each char to int when needed).\n\n   We can do:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          # Each s is a string of m characters\n          gradebook.append([int(ch) for ch in s])\n\n   Step 3: For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum mark.\n\n      max_marks = []\n      for j in range(m):\n          col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n          max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check if there exists at least one subject j such that gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          successful = False\n          for j in range(m):\n              if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                  successful = True\n                  break\n          if successful:\n              count += 1\n\n   Step 5: Print count.\n\n But note: what if there are multiple maximums? That's handled because we are just checking if the student has the maximum in any subject.\n\n However, let me test with the second sample:\n\n   Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   n=3, m=5\n   grades = [\n        [9,1,7,2,8],\n        [1,1,8,2,8],\n        [1,1,1,1,1]\n   ]\n\n   Compute max_marks for each subject:\n\n        subject0: [9,1,1] -> max=9\n        subject1: [1,1,1] -> max=1\n        subject2: [7,8,1] -> max=8\n        subject3: [2,2,1] -> max=2\n        subject4: [8,8,1] -> max=8\n\n   Now check each student:\n\n        student0: [9,1,7,2,8] \n            subject0: 9==9 -> successful.\n\n        student1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n            subject0: 1 !=9 -> skip\n            subject1: 1==1 -> successful.\n\n        student2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n            subject0: 1!=9 -> skip\n            subject1: 1==1 -> successful.\n\n   So output is 3.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   Edge case: n=1, m=1 -> one student, one subject. \n        If the student's mark is the maximum (only one) then he is successful.\n\n   Another edge: n=2, m=1, with two same marks: \n        Input: \"2 1\\n5\\n5\"\n        max_marks[0] = 5\n        Student0: 5 ==5 -> successful\n        Student1: 5 ==5 -> successful\n        Output: 2\n\n   Another edge: n=2, m=1, different marks: \n        Input: \"2 1\\n5\\n4\"\n        max_marks[0] = 5\n        Student0: 5==5 -> successful\n        Student1: 4!=5 -> not successful\n        Output: 1\n\n   So the code should work.\n\n   However, note: the input might have the first line and then n lines. We are reading exactly n lines.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: The input example was given as a string in the example, but in standard input we read from stdin.\n\n   Example input format:\n\n        \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   But actually, we are reading from stdin. So we do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = input().strip()\n            # Then process the line\n\n   We'll assume the input is given as described.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example input was provided as a string in the example. But the problem says \"from standard input\".\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Since n and m are at most 100, this is efficient.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read each subsequent line to form a matrix where each row represents a student's marks in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps identify the benchmark for being the best in that subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the highest mark in any subject. If they have, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        if len(s) != m:\n            s = s[:m]\n        gradebook.append([int(ch) for ch in s])\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks[j] = max(col)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the first line to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). It then reads each student's marks, converting each character into an integer to form a matrix (gradebook).\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all students' marks in that subject. This gives us the benchmark for being the best in each subject.\n3. **Successful Students Check**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Result Output**: The total count of successful students is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring accurate identification of successful students. The solution handles edge cases such as single students or subjects with multiple highest marks gracefully.",
