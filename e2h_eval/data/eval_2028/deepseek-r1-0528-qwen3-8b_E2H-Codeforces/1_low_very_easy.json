The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The border of an (a x b) rectangle has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is at least 1x1, then the border is: \n        top and bottom: each row has b cells, but wait: actually for a rectangle of a rows and b columns, the border is:\n        top: b, bottom: b, left and right: (a-2) for each? Actually, no: the entire border is 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that if the rectangle has only 1 cell (a=1, b=1) then the border is 1, but by the formula above: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> that doesn't work.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For an a x b rectangle, the border (if we consider it as the outer frame) is:\n   top row: b cells\n   bottom row: b cells\n   the two sides (excluding the corners because they are already counted): (a-2) * 2 cells.\n\n So total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, when a=1 or b=1, this formula fails. However, note the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate (which is w x h). Since w>=3 and h>=3, the first ring is at least 3x3 -> 8 cells.\n\n However, the problem also states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So the inner rectangles will always be at least 1x1? Actually, let's see:\n\n The inner rectangle for the i-th ring has dimensions: \n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n And we require that the ring exists. The problem says k is such that we don't go beyond the plate.\n\n But note: the formula for the number of cells in the ring is the perimeter of the rectangle? Actually, the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle must have at least 1 cell in each dimension to define a border? \n\n However, note: the problem states that the ring has width 1 cell. So if the inner rectangle is 1x1, then the border is just that one cell? But wait, the description says \"the first one should go along the edge\", meaning the entire outer boundary. Then the second ring is 2 cells away, so the next rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n But note: the example input '3 3 1' gives 8. For a 3x3, the outer border is 8 cells.\n\n How about the second ring? For a 3x3, can we have two rings? \n   k_max = floor((min(3,3)+1)/4) = floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed for 3x3.\n\n Example: \"7 9 1\" -> 28, \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n\n Let's compute for 7x9 with k=1:\n   The first ring: rectangle is 7x9 -> border: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28. That matches.\n\n For k=2: \n   First ring: 7x9 -> 28\n   Second ring: rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5 -> border: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12\n   Total = 28 + 12 = 40. That matches.\n\n However, what if the rectangle becomes too small? The problem states k is bounded by floor((min(n,m)+1)/4). So we won't get a negative dimension.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"k\" is at least 1 and at most that value. So we don't need to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n However, note: the formula for the border of a rectangle of size a x b (with a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the outer edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one. Each ring has a width of one cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are given by (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), where w and h are the original dimensions of the plate. The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of this inner rectangle, which can be calculated using the formula: 2*a + 2*b - 4, where a and b are the dimensions of the inner rectangle.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle, then apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring. Sum these values across all rings to get the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (k is at most around 25 for the largest inputs).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n        \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to zero to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle: `a = w - 4*(i-1)` and `b = h - 4*(i-1)`.\n   - Check if the dimensions are positive; if not, break the loop as further rings would have non-positive dimensions.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the perimeter formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`.\n   - Add the computed cells to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by validating dimensions before each ring calculation.",
