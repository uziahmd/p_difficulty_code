Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to another if they share a non-zero boundary (i.e., a segment of a road). This means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road (and share a portion of that road).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to traverse the graph of blocks explicitly (since there could be many blocks). Instead, we can think in terms of the roads that separate the home from the university.\n\n Actually, here's a well-known trick for such problems: \n   - Each road is defined by a linear equation. For a point (x, y), we can define the sign of the expression ax + by + c. \n   - Two points (home and university) will lie on the same side of a road if the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) is the same for both, and on opposite sides if the signs differ.\n\n Now, consider: to go from home to university, we must cross every road that separates them. But note: we are allowed to jump from one block to an adjacent one only if they share a border (which corresponds to crossing one road). However, the problem does not require crossing one road at a time? Actually, the movement is defined as moving from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. Since two blocks that are separated by one road share a border (the entire segment of the road between two intersections), then crossing one road is one step.\n\n But wait: what if two adjacent blocks are separated by two roads? Then they don't share a border? Actually, no: each road is a line. Two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. In fact, the entire set of roads divides the plane, and two blocks are adjacent if their separating wall is exactly one road.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So if two blocks share a common segment of a road (from one intersection to the next) then that's a nonzero border. But if two blocks are separated by two different roads, then they don't share a common border (they are separated by two lines, so they are two steps away). \n\n Therefore, the minimum number of steps required is the number of roads that separate the home and the university? But wait: sometimes you can cross multiple roads at once? Actually, when you cross a road, you are moving from one side to the other. The home and university might be separated by k roads. Then, you have to cross each of these k roads at least once. However, note that if you cross two roads that are parallel, you might do it in one step? Let me clarify:\n\n Actually, the problem states that we can only move from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a border) in one step. The adjacent block is separated by exactly one road. Therefore, each crossing of a road is one step. However, if two roads are the same, but they are not (guaranteed distinct). And if two roads are parallel, then they are distinct and you still have to cross each one separately.\n\n But note: the movement is defined by blocks. The entire journey from home to university requires crossing every road that separates them. However, consider: if you cross a road, you change the side of that road. To get from home to university, you must have the same configuration of sides for all roads that are not separating them, and for the separating ones, you must have flipped the side.\n\n However, the catch: the steps are defined by adjacent blocks. But the minimal path might require crossing some roads multiple times? Actually, no. Because if you cross a road an even number of times, you end up on the original side. But since we want to get from home to university, which is fixed, we must cross each separating road an odd number of times, and non-separating roads an even number of times (or zero). But the minimal steps would be the number of separating roads, because we can arrange to cross each separating road exactly once.\n\n However, wait: the example inputs:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), 2 roads: [0 1 0] and [1 0 0]\n\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0\n\n   The home (1,1) is above the x-axis and right of the y",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (i.e., moving from one block to an adjacent block that shares a non-zero boundary segment). The key insight is recognizing that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into blocks. The home and university are located in two different blocks. The minimal path between these blocks requires crossing each road that separates them exactly once. Roads that do not separate the two points can be ignored as they do not affect the path.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, this road must be crossed at least once. The total number of such roads gives the minimal number of steps needed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation \\(ax + by + c\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(ax + by + c\\) at both points.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: If the signs of the evaluated expressions for the home and university differ, the road is counted as separating the two points.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging geometric properties of lines and point positions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
