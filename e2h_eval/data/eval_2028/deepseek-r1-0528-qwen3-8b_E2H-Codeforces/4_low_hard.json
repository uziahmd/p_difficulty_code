The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Each round: \n   - If A[i] vs B[j] is a win for A, then no spot for A and none for B (or rather, the loser gets a spot).\n   - Otherwise, if B wins, then Polycarpus gets one red spot.\n\n The sequences A and B are given as strings, and we cycle through them.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are given n (number of rounds), string A (length m), string B (length k).\n\n 2. We need to consider that the i-th element (0-indexed) of A is taken from the sequence at index (i mod m) and similarly for B (index j mod k).\n\n 3. However, n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n 4. We note that the entire game repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the state (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n 5. But note: in the first round, the indices are (0,0). Then (0,1), (0,2) ... until (0,k-1) then (1,0) etc.\n\n 6. However, we can break the n rounds into cycles of length L = LCM(m, k). But note: the rounds go from 0 to n-1, and the state for the r-th round (r from 0 to n-1) is (r mod m, r mod k)? Actually, no: \n    For round r (0-indexed round 0 to n-1):\n        A_index = r % m\n        B_index = r % k\n\n 7. So the state (a_i, b_j) for round r is determined by (r % m, r % k). The entire pattern of states will repeat every T rounds, where T is the least common multiple of m and k, but note: the state (a_i, b_j) repeats when both r1 % m == r2 % m and r1 % k == r2 % k. This happens when (r1 - r2) is divisible by both m and k, i.e., by LCM(m,k). However, the total distinct states is m*k.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can group rounds by the state (i, j) where i from 0 to m-1 and j from 0 to k-1. But note that the same state (i,j) occurs every LCM(m,k) / (m * k) ??? Actually, the state (i,j) occurs in rounds r such that r ≡ i (mod m) and r ≡ j (mod k). The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that for each (i,j) there is a solution modulo LCM(m,k) if and only if i ≡ j (mod gcd(m,k))? Not exactly, but we don't need that.\n\n 9. We can instead precompute for each round index r (from 0 to T-1, where T = LCM(m,k)) the outcome (if any) and then count the frequency of each outcome.\n\n 10. However, note: n can be very large, but m and k are at most 1000, so T = LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 (which is 1e6) which is acceptable because we can do one full cycle of T rounds (if T is 1e6, then we do 1e6 rounds, and then multiply by the number of cycles and then add the remainder).\n\n 11. Steps:\n     Let T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)\n\n     But note: we might not need the exact LCM value, we can compute the number of complete cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n 12. However, we can also use the fact that the state (i,j) for a given (i,j) occurs floor((n - (i*k+j)) / (T)) + ... ? That might be complicated.\n\n 13. Alternative approach:\n\n     We can iterate over all pairs (i, j) with i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1]. For each pair, we can determine the round numbers at which this state occurs.\n\n     How many times does the state (i,j) occur in n rounds?\n        We require r such that r ≡ i (mod m) and r ≡ j (mod k). The set of such r is an arithmetic progression starting at r0 (the smallest non-negative solution) with step T = LCM(m,k). \n\n        The condition for a solution is that i mod g = j mod g,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the result without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a repeating sequence of moves (rock, paper, scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`, denoted as `T`. Within one cycle of `T` rounds, the pattern of wins and losses repeats.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate `T` as the LCM of `m` and `k`. This helps in identifying the repeating pattern.\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each possible pair of moves (i from Nikephoros's sequence and j from Polycarpus's sequence), determine how many times this pair occurs in `n` rounds. The number of occurrences can be derived using arithmetic progression properties.\n   - **Efficiency**: Instead of processing each round individually, we process cycles and use mathematical formulas to compute the total losses in constant time relative to the cycle length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    g = gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    total_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    def outcome(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return 0, 0\n        elif (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 0, 1\n        else:\n            return 1, 0\n            \n    total_nike = 0\n    total_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(k):\n            start_index = i * k + j\n            if start_index < T:\n                count = total_cycles\n                if start_index < remainder:\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    count += 0\n                a_move = A_str[i % m]\n                b_move = B_str[j % k]\n                nike_loss, poly_loss = outcome(a_move, b_move)\n                total_nike += count * nike_loss\n                total_poly += count * poly_loss\n                \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences (`m` and `k`) is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Processing**: The total number of complete cycles (`total_cycles`) and the remaining rounds (`remainder`) are calculated.\n4. **Outcome Determination**: For each possible pair of moves (one from each sequence), the function `outcome` checks who wins or if it's a draw. The results are tallied for each occurrence of the move pair.\n5. **Efficient Counting**: Using arithmetic progression, the code calculates how many times each move pair appears in the remaining rounds and updates the total losses accordingly.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging cycle detection and mathematical counting, avoiding the need for brute-force simulation of each round.",
