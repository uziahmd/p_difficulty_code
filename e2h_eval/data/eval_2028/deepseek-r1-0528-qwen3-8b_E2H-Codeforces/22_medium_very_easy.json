After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject (column) what is the best (maximum) mark.\n 4. Then, for each student, check if there exists at least one subject in which they have the maximum mark (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark for a subject, but that's okay because being best only requires having the highest mark, even if shared).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"successful\" if there exists a subject he is the best at. And best means no student has a higher mark. So if two students have the same highest mark, then both are considered best for that subject.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   Let max_mark[j] = maximum character (as a digit) in column j.\n\n Then, for each student i (from 0 to n-1):\n   Check for each subject j: if the mark of student i in subject j equals max_mark[j], then student i is successful (because we found one subject where he is best) and we can break early for this student.\n\n But note: we don't need to know the exact subject, just if there's at least one.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if a student has the maximum mark in one or more subjects, then he is successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Parse input.\n Step 2: Transpose the gradebook so that we have columns as rows? Or process columns by iterating over indices.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let data = list of strings (each string is a row)\n\n Then, for j in range(m): \n   column_j = [data[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n\n Then compute max_column = max(column_j)  (but note: we are dealing with characters, but comparing characters lexicographically is same as numerically for '1' to '9')\n\n Then, for each student i, check for any j such that data[i][j] == max_column[j]\n\n However, note: we cannot compare by index j without having stored the max for each j.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (each column) of length m.\n\n Then, for each student i (each row), we check:\n   for j in range(m):\n        if data[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            then mark student i as successful and break the inner loop.\n\n But note: we are not storing the max_marks per column until we process all columns.\n\n We can do:\n\n Step 1: Read n, m and the grid.\n\n Step 2: Precompute an array `best_marks` for each subject (index j from 0 to m-1) as the maximum mark in that subject.\n\n Step 3: For each student i, check if for any j, grid[i][j] == best_marks[j]. \n\n However, note: the grid is given as a list of strings, and each string has m characters.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We have n=3, m=3.\n   grid = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   Then, for subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n          subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n          subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Then, for student0: '2' (subject0) matches best_marks[0] ('2') -> successful.\n        student1: subject0: '2' matches, so successful.\n        student2: subject0: '1' != '2'; subject1: '1' != '3'; subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n But wait, the example says student number 1 is best at subjects 1 and 3 (note: the example uses 1-indexed). In our 0-indexed, subject0 is the first subject.\n\n However, the example says: \n   Student1 (the first row) is best at subjects 1 and 3. In our grid, the first row is index0, and the third subject (index2) has mark '3'. Also, in subject0 the first row has '2', and the second row also has '2' (so they are both best in subject0). But note: the example says student1 is best at subjects 1 and 3. \n\n Actually, the example says:\n   \"student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\"\n   Here, the numbering of subjects is from 1 to m.\n\n In our grid, subject1 (index0) and subject3 (index2) are considered.\n\n But wait, the example input grid:\n     223\n     232\n     112\n\n The first student (row0) has marks: 2,2,3 -> so in subject1 (first subject) they have 2, in subject2 (second) 2, in subject3 (third) 3.\n\n The second student (row1) has 2,3,2 -> so in subject1:2, subject2:3, subject3:2.\n\n The third student (row2) has 1,1,2.\n\n Now, for subject1 (index0): the highest mark is 2, and two students (row0 and row1) have it.\n For subject2 (index1): the highest mark is 3, and only row1 has it.\n For subject3 (index2): the highest mark is 3, and only row0 has it.\n\n So student0 (first student) is best at subject3 (index2) and also subject1 (index0) because 2 is the max. But wait, the example says student1 (which is the first student) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n So we have to be careful: the example counts the first student as student1.\n\n Our code counts from 0. But that doesn't matter for the count.\n\n However, note: the example output is 2, meaning two successful students: the first and the second.\n\n But in our calculation above, we found that the first student (index0) is successful because he is best in subject0 (which is subject1) and subject2 (subject3). The second student (index1) is successful because he is best in subject1 (subject2). The third (index2) is not.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's read the input.\n\n Example input format: \n   First line: \"3 3\"\n   Next three lines: \"223\", \"232\", \"112\"\n\n We can do:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if the first line is provided, then:\n      n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n      grid = data[1:1+n]\n\n   But note: the input might be given as a single string including the first line and the next n lines.\n\n However, the problem says: \n   The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\n We assume the input is given exactly as described.\n\n Steps:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   Then, we want to compute the best mark for each subject (each column):\n\n   best_marks = []\n   for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        best_marks.append(max(col))\n\n   Then, successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == best_marks[j]:\n                successful += 1\n                break   # no need to check other subjects for this student\n\n   But wait: what if the same student is best in multiple subjects? We break as soon as we find one, which is correct.\n\n   Print successful.\n\n However, let's test with the second sample:\n\n   Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   We have n=3, m=5.\n\n   grid = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n   Compute best_marks for each column:\n\n     col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max '9'\n     col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max '1'\n     col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max '8'\n     col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max '2'\n     col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max '8'\n\n   Now, check each student:\n\n     Student0: '9' (col0) -> matches best_marks[0] -> successful. (count=1)\n     Student1: \n          col0: '1' != '9'\n          col1: '1' == '1' -> successful. (count=2)\n     Student2:\n          col0: '1' != '9'\n          col1: '1' == '1' -> successful. (count=3)\n\n   Output: 3, which matches.\n\n   Another test case: if there are multiple maximums, then we break as soon as one is found.\n\n   This algorithm is O(n*m) which is acceptable since n, m <= 100.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: There is no need to use transposed matrix, we can just iterate over columns by index.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # If there's only one student, then we still have to check for each subject if the mark is the maximum (which is itself).\n\n   best_marks = [0] * m   # we'll fill with the max of each column\n\n   for j in range(m):\n        col = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            col.append(grid[i][j])\n        best_marks[j] = max(col)\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == best_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            successful += 1\n\n   print(successful)\n\n But note: we can also avoid building the entire col list by using a generator expression in max, but the above is clear.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   best_marks = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n However, the above is equivalent and concise.\n\n Let me write the concise version:\n\n   best_marks = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n But wait, the grid is a list of strings, and we are indexing by j then i. Actually, we are doing for each j (subject) and then taking the maximum over i (students) of the j-th character.\n\n However, note: the grid is stored by rows. So for fixed j, we want to take the j-th character of each row.\n\n But the above list comprehension for j in range(m) and then i in range(n) is acceptable.\n\n However, the grid is stored as list of strings, so grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th string.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   best_marks = []\n   for j in range(m):\n        col_max = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n        best_marks.append(col_max)\n\n   Then the rest.\n\n Alternatively, we can use zip to transpose the grid:\n\n   transposed = zip(*grid)\n   best_marks = [max(col) for col in transposed]\n\n This is even simpler.\n\n Since m and n are small, we can do:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # Transpose the grid: each column becomes a tuple (or list) of the column's elements.\n   # But note: we can use zip(*grid) to get the columns.\n\n   best_marks = [max(column) for column in zip(*grid)]\n\n Then, for each student i, we look at the row grid[i] and check if any element in grid[i] is equal to the corresponding best_marks element.\n\n However, note: when we use zip(*grid), the order of the columns is preserved. The first element of each row (i.e., the first column) is the first tuple.\n\n But wait: the grid is given as rows. The zip(*grid) will give the columns. For example, grid = ['223', '232', '112']:\n\n   zip(*grid) gives: \n        ('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')\n\n   Then, best_marks = [max(('2','2','1')), max(('2','3','1')), max(('3','2','2'))] \n        -> ['2','3','3']\n\n   Then, for student0 (first row): '2' (which is the first element of the row) vs best_marks[0] '2' -> match.\n\n   This works.\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = grid[i]\n            for j in range(m):\n                if row[j] == best_marks[j]:\n                    successful += 1\n                    break\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = grid[i]\n            # We can check if any(row[j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m))\n            if any(row[j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n                successful += 1\n\n   Or even:\n\n        successful = sum(1 for i in range(n) if any(row[i][j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)))\n\n   But wait, in the above, we are using row[i] but i is the student index. Actually, we have:\n\n        row = grid[i]\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        successful = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if any(grid[i][j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n                successful += 1\n\n   This is more concise.\n\n Let's write the code using zip and then a list for best_marks.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # If there are no subjects (m==0) then we have to handle, but the problem states n,m>=1.\n\n   best_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == best_marks[j]:\n                successful += 1\n                break\n\n   print(successful)\n\n But note: the above inner loop breaks at the first subject that makes the student successful.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        if any(grid[i][j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            successful += 1\n\n   This avoids the break and the explicit for loop.\n\n Which is better? The any() version is more Pythonic and clear.\n\n Let's use that.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # Transpose the grid to get columns\n   # But note: the grid is given as a list of strings. The * operator on a list of strings will unpack the strings and then zip takes one character from each string.\n   best_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        if any(row[j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            successful += 1\n\n   print(successful)\n\n However, note: the grid may have been read as strings and the characters are single-digit, so this is safe.\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   grid = ['223','232','112']\n   zip(*grid) = [('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')]\n   best_marks = ['2','3','3']\n\n   Then for i=0: row='223'\n        j=0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful +=1, and break (in the any() we don't break the any, but the condition is met and we move to next i)\n   i=1: row='232'\n        j=0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful becomes 2.\n   i=2: row='112'\n        j0: '1'!='2', j1: '1'!='3', j2: '2'!='3' -> false.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n   zip(*grid) = \n        ('9','1','1'), \n        ('1','1','1'),\n        ('7','8','1'),\n        ('2','2','1'),\n        ('8','8','1')\n   best_marks = ['9','1','8','2','8']\n\n   i=0: '91728': \n        j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful=1.\n   i=1: '11828':\n        j0: '1' != '9' -> continue; j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful=2.\n   i=2: '11111':\n        j0: '1' != '9'; j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful=3.\n\n   Output: 3.\n\n It works.\n\n However, note: the problem says the input is provided as a string that might include the sample inputs. We are reading from stdin.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as:\n\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n This is two strings. But actually, the input is provided as standard input. We are reading the first line, then the next n lines.\n\n We assume the input is provided via standard input.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided example.\n\n But note: the problem says the input format, and we are reading as:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n This should work.\n\n However, if the input is given as a single string (like in the example), we might need to consider how we read.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input is given as:\n\n   Input\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n This is just an example representation. In reality, we are to read from stdin.\n\n But in the example, the input has two lines for the first sample and three lines for the second sample.\n\n We are reading the first line for n and m, then the next n lines.\n\n So if we are given:\n\n   \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n Then we read the first line: \"3 3\" -> split to [3,3]\n Then read the next 3 lines: \"223\", \"232\", \"112\".\n\n But note: the example input is provided as a string that might be split arbitrarily. However, in standard competitive programming, we read from stdin line by line.\n\n Since the problem states the input format, we assume that the input is given as:\n\n   Line1: n m\n   Line2: first student's marks\n   ...\n   Line n+m: last student's marks\n\n But wait, the first line is n and m, then n lines. So total lines = 1 + n.\n\n However, the example input string is given as a string that includes the newline characters. When we use input(), it will read the next line.\n\n But if we are running in an environment that provides the entire input at once (like some online judges), then we can use:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n   grid = data[1:1+n]\n\n But the problem does not specify the environment.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Print the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\"\n\n And the example input is provided as two separate lines for the first sample and so on.\n\n Since the constraints are small, we can use either method.\n\n But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and we are to write a script that reads from stdin.\n\n I'll stick to the simple method: using input().\n\n However, if the input is large (but n, m <=100, so it's small) then input() is acceptable.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: sometimes the input might be provided from a file or pipe. The input() function reads from stdin.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # If the grid is empty, then n==0, then we output 0.\n\n   best_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)] if n > 0 else []\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # If there are no subjects (m==0) then we skip, but m>=1 per problem.\n        if any(row[j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            successful += 1\n\n   print(successful)\n\n We can also handle the case when n==0 (no students) but the problem says n>=1.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided as a string that might be split arbitrarily, but we are reading line by line.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n This is actually two separate test cases. But the problem says:\n\n   Input\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   Output\n   ['2', '3']\n\n But wait, that's two test cases. However, the problem says:\n\n   The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\n   So the input is one test case. The example shows two test cases, but in competitive programming problems, we usually have one test case per run.\n\n   The example representation might be showing two examples.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\"\n\n   And the input format is as described.\n\n   So we assume one test case per run.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as a list of two strings. But in the real competition, we would read until EOF or one test case.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This might be a representation of two test cases. However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n   And the example output is two numbers.\n\n   But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. So we assume one.\n\n   However, looking at the example, it says:\n\n        Input\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        Output\n        ['2', '3']\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives the input and output.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the number of test cases. So we assume one.\n\n   But the example input is two separate strings. How do we know?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\"\n\n   And the example input is two test cases? Or is the example input a string that contains two test cases?\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is two strings. But in the problem, the input is provided from standard input.\n\n   In standard programming competitions, the input is given one test case at a time.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. So we assume one.\n\n   But the example output is two numbers. This suggests that the example input is two test cases.\n\n   Clarification: the problem statement says:\n\n        Input\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        Output\n        ['2', '3']\n\n   So they are showing two examples.\n\n   But the actual input for the program is one test case. We don't know the judge's input.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input format is described, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is two test cases. This might be a mistake.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects.\" — this is one test case.\n\n   The problem does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input representation is two strings. This might be because the problem statement is showing two examples side by side.\n\n   We are to write a program that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\n   The judge will provide one test case per execution.\n\n   So we don't need to handle multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement example input is given as a list of two strings. But that's just for illustration.\n\n   We'll write the code for one test case.\n\n   But note: the example output is two numbers. That means the example input is two test cases. \n\n   Wait, perhaps the problem statement intended to show two separate examples. But the input format is one test case.\n\n   After checking the example: \n\n        Example Input 1: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\" -> Output 2.\n        Example Input 2: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\" -> Output 3.\n\n   So the example input is two test cases, but the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then shows two test cases.\n\n   This is ambiguous.\n\n   Let me check the note: \"In the first sample test ... In the second sample test ...\"\n\n   So the problem has two sample tests.\n\n   But the problem does not say whether the input can have multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\", and then n lines, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, if the judge provides multiple test cases, we might break.\n\n   But the problem constraints: n, m from 1 to 100, and the input is given as described.\n\n   We must clarify: the problem says \"Print the single number\", meaning one number per test case.\n\n   And the example input is two separate test cases, but they are shown together.\n\n   How should we handle?\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   But the example input is two test cases. This is confusing.\n\n   I think the problem statement is showing two examples. In reality, we read one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n   If the judge runs the program multiple times, each time with one test case, then we output the answer for that test case.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases in one run (by giving multiple lines of input beyond the first line and n lines), then our program will fail.\n\n   But the problem says: the first line is n and m, then n lines.\n\n   So we read exactly n+1 lines.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   ... rest ...\n\n   This will work for one test case.\n\n   But if the judge provides two test cases in one run, then we will read the first test case and then the next lines might be part of the second test case, but we don't read them.\n\n   However, the problem says the input is the first line and then n lines.\n\n   We assume one test case.\n\n   Let me submit the code as is.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement example input is two test cases. How did they show two? Maybe they mean two separate runs.\n\n   We'll assume one test case per run.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   best_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n\n   successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        if any(row[j] == best_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            successful += 1\n\n   print(successful)\n\n But note: what if m==0? The problem says n, m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example1: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example2:\n   Input:\n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   Output: 3\n\n It works.\n\n However, note: the example input was given as a string that included the newlines. Our code uses input() which handles that.\n\n But wait, the example input string is:\n\n        \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   When we do input(), the first call reads \"3 3\", then the next three calls read \"223\", \"232\", \"112\".\n\n   Yes.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   Let me run the code in my head for edge cases:\n\n   Edge case: n=1, m=1\n        Input: \n           1 1\n           5\n\n        Then, best_marks = [max(('5',))] = ['5']\n        Then, for the only student: \n             row = ['5'] (actually the row is the string '5', so we compare: '5'=='5' -> True -> successful=1.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n   Edge case: n=1, m=2\n        Input: \n           1 2\n           91\n\n        best_marks = [max('9','1') -> '9', max('1')] -> wait, no: we have one student, so the grid is ['91'].\n\n        Then, zip(*['91']) gives: ('9',), and then ('1',) -> wait, no: \n            *['91'] -> it becomes two arguments: '9' and '1'? \n            Then zip(('9','1'))? Actually, no: \n\n        Actually, zip(*['91']) is equivalent to zip('9','1') -> but wait, no: \n\n        Let me break down:\n\n            grid = ['91']   (a list with one string of length 2)\n\n            zip(*grid) = zip('91') -> but wait, the * operator applied to a list with one element will expand that one element. \n\n            So *['91'] -> '91' (the string) is one argument. Then zip('91')? \n\n            But zip expects iterable(s). \n\n            Actually, the correct way: \n\n                zip(*grid) is the same as zip(*['91']) \n\n            What does *['91'] do? It expands the list ['91'] into the argument '91'. So we are calling zip('91').\n\n            But wait, the grid is a list of one string of two characters. Then *grid is the string '91'. Then zip('91') is equivalent to zip(['9','1'])? \n\n            No, because zip(*grid) is defined as: \n\n                zip(*grid) is the same as: \n                    it = iter(grid)\n                    zip(it, it, ...)   but wait, no.\n\n            Actually, the * operator in function calls expands the list. So:\n\n                zip(*['91']) is the same as zip('91')\n\n            And zip('91') is equivalent to zip('9','1')? \n\n            Let me check:\n\n                list(zip('91')) -> [('9',), ('1',)]? \n\n            No, wait:\n\n                The zip function takes multiple iterables and aggregates elements from each.\n\n                zip('91') is the same as zip(iterable1) but that is not allowed. \n\n            Actually, the correct expansion for a grid with one row is:\n\n                We have one row: ['91'] -> then *grid is the string '91'. Then we are zipping one iterable: the string '91'. \n\n            But wait, the definition of zip is:\n\n                zip(*iterables) --> iterator making tuples, with the i-th tuple containing the i-th element from each of the arguments.\n\n            So if we do zip('91'), then we are providing one iterable. Then the result is an iterator that returns tuples of one element from that iterable? \n\n            Actually, no: \n\n                list(zip('91')) would be [('9',)] and then we are out of elements? \n\n            Let me test in Python:\n\n                >>> list(zip('91'))\n                [('9',), ('1',)]\n\n            But wait, no: \n\n                Actually, the * operator expands the grid. The grid is a list of one string. Then *grid becomes the string. Then zip(string) is:\n\n                >>> list(zip('91'))\n                [('9',), ('1',)]\n\n            But wait, the original grid is:\n\n                grid = ['91']   -> one row with two columns.\n\n            We want the columns: \n\n                Column0: ['9'] (from the first character of the only row)\n                Column1: ['1'] (from the second character)\n\n            Then best_marks = [max('9'), max('1')] = ['9','1']\n\n            Then, for the student: row0 = '91'\n            Check: \n                j0: '9' == '9' -> True -> successful.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            But the zip(*['91']) produces [('9',), ('1',)]? \n\n            Actually, no: \n\n                The * operator expands the list. So:\n\n                zip(*['91']) is equivalent to:\n\n                    zip('91')\n\n                But wait, the zip function expects multiple iterables. Here, we are passing one iterable. \n\n            Correction: \n\n                zip(*['91']) is equivalent to:\n\n                    zip('91')   -> but wait, that's one argument.\n\n            How does zip work with one argument?\n\n            According to the documentation, zip(*iterables) packs the arguments. But if we pass one iterable, then:\n\n                list(zip('91')) \n\n            returns [('9',), ('1',)]? \n\n            Let me run:\n\n                >>> list(zip('91'))\n                [('9',), ('1',)]\n\n            Actually, no. \n\n                >>> list(zip('91'))\n                [('9',), ('1',)] -> wait, no, that's not right.\n\n            Actually, the correct behavior:\n\n                The * operator expands the list. So:\n\n                    zip(*['91']) is the same as zip('91') \n\n                But wait, the grid is a list of one row. The *grid expands to one argument: the string '91'. Then zip('91') is:\n\n                How many elements",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Best Marks**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves transposing the gradebook (converting rows to columns) and then finding the maximum mark in each column.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    index = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        \n    if n == 0 or m == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    best_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n    \n    successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        for j in range(m):\n            if row[j] == best_marks[j]:\n                successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and processes them. The first line contains the dimensions of the gradebook (n students and m subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Transpose Operation**: The `zip(*grid)` function transposes the gradebook, converting columns into rows. This allows us to easily find the highest mark in each subject by taking the maximum value in each transposed row.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student, the code checks each subject's mark against the highest mark in that subject. If a match is found, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects by leveraging the transpose operation and early termination during the success check, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
