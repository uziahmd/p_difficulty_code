And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait: the example says \"then the result is\" and then they don't show the overall average?\n Let me read the problem again: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n How many weeks? n-k+1 weeks. So we have to compute the sum of sleep hours for each week (each contiguous k days) and then take the average of these sums?\n\n Actually, the example output is 9.0. Let's break down:\n\n For the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   Week1: [3,4] -> sum = 7\n   Week2: [4,7] -> sum = 11\n\n Then total sum of all week sums is 7+11 = 18.\n Then average = 18 / (number of weeks) = 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n So the problem is: \n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j]\n\n But note: we can compute the total_sleep without iterating each week by using prefix sums.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n, k and the list a.\n  2. Precompute the prefix sum array for a.\n      Let prefix[0] = 0\n      prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a(i-1)\n\n  3. Then the sum for a week starting at i (from 0 to n-k) is:\n        s_i = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n  4. Total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} s_i = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n  5. Alternatively, we can combine the terms:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n  6. Then the average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n However, note that the prefix array is defined such that prefix[i] = sum(a[0:i]).\n So the entire array a's sum is prefix[n].\n\n But the above expression for total_sleep can be simplified:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n      = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But note: the indices in the prefix array go from 0 to n.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\n      total_sleep = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_k}) + ... \n\n This is a sliding window. We can also compute by:\n\n      total_sleep = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}) * (k) doesn't apply because each element is counted multiple times.\n\n Actually, each element a_i appears in exactly (k - i) weeks? Not exactly: \n   For an element at index i (0-indexed), it will appear in the weeks that start from 0 to (n-k) but only if the week includes i.\n   The condition for including a_i is: the week must start at most i and at least i-k+1 (but cannot start before 0 or after n-k).\n\n   Actually, the element a_i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n Alternatively, we can use the prefix sum method above.\n\n But note: the direct summation of the week sums is O(n) and we have n-k+1 weeks, so we can do:\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n But that would be O(n) which is acceptable for n up to 200000? Actually, the number of weeks is n-k+1, which can be about 200000, so this loop is acceptable.\n\n However, we can compute the total_sleep faster by:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But note: the prefix array is just the cumulative sums. We can precompute the prefix array and then use slicing or a formula to get the sum of the prefix array from index L to R.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid building a full prefix array and then summing the slices by:\n\n      Let P[i] = prefix[i] for i in range(0, n+1)\n\n      Then the first part: S1 = sum(P[k: n+1])\n      The second part: S2 = sum(P[0: n-k+1])\n\n      Then total_sleep = S1 - S2.\n\n But wait: our prefix array has indices from 0 to n (inclusive). And we want to sum from k to n (inclusive) and subtract the sum from 0 to n-k (inclusive).\n\n However, note: the prefix array is defined as:\n      P[0] = 0\n      P[1] = a0\n      P[2] = a0+a1\n      ...\n      P[i] = a0+...+a_{i-1}\n\n Then the week starting at i (0-indexed) uses the segment from i to i+k-1, and its sum is P[i+k] - P[i].\n\n But then the total_sleep is:\n\n      total_sleep = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n]-P[n-k])\n\n      = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n Now, how to compute the sum of P from k to n? and from 0 to n-k?\n\n We can precompute the prefix_sum_of_prefixes? But note: n can be up to 200000, and we are allowed to do O(n) but we want to be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But that might be overkill.\n\n Since we are already building a prefix array (which is an array of n+1 elements), we can build another array for the prefix of the prefix array? Or we can use the same idea: \n\n      Let Q[i] = Q[i-1] + P[i]   for i from 0 to n.\n\n But then:\n\n      S1 = Q[n] - (Q[k-1] if k>0 else 0)   [if we define Q as the prefix sum of P, then Q[i] = P[0]+P[1]+...+P[i]]\n\n      Similarly, S2 = Q[n-k]   [because we want P[0] to P[n-k], so indices 0 to n-k]\n\n However, note: our prefix array P has n+1 elements (indices 0..n). So we can do:\n\n      Let P[0] = 0\n      For i in range(1, n+1):\n          P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]   # if we have the list a of n numbers.\n\n      Then let Q[0] = P[0]\n      For i in range(1, n+1):\n          Q[i] = Q[i-1] + P[i]\n\n      Then:\n          S1 = Q[n] - Q[k-1]   [because we want indices from k to n: so from index k to index n, inclusive? \n          Actually, our Q is defined so that Q[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i} P[j]. Then the sum of P from j=k to j=n is Q[n] - Q[k-1] if k>=1, but if k==0 then adjust.\n\n      But wait: we need to be careful. Our indices for P: \n          We want to sum P from index k to index n (inclusive). \n          Then that is Q[n] - Q[k-1] because:\n            Q[k-1] = P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[k-1]\n            Then the sum from P[k] to P[n] is Q[n] - Q[k-1].\n\n      Similarly, the sum from P[0] to P[n-k] is Q[n-k].\n\n      Therefore: total_sleep = (Q[n] - Q[k-1]) - Q[n-k]\n\n But note: k can be 0? No, k>=1 per input.\n\n However, there is a simpler way: since we have the entire array P (the prefix sums) and we want to compute the sum of P from index k to n, and from 0 to n-k, we can do:\n\n      total_sleep = (sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:n-k+1]))   ??? \n\n Wait, no: the week sum expression is:\n\n      total_sleep = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n]-P[n-k])\n\n      = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n But note: the second part goes from P[0] to P[n-k], which is n-k+1 terms.\n\n And the first part goes from P[k] to P[n], which is n-k+1 terms as well (from index k to n inclusive: n - k + 1 terms).\n\n So we can compute:\n\n      part1 = sum(P[k:])   # from index k to n (both inclusive)\n      part2 = sum(P[:n-k+1])   # from index 0 to n-k (inclusive)\n\n      total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n But note: the list P has n+1 elements (indices 0..n). The slice P[k:] starts at index k and goes to the end (index n). The slice P[:n-k+1] goes from 0 to n-k (because the stop index in slicing is exclusive? Actually, no: in Python, slicing is [start:end] and the end is excluded. But wait, our definition of the prefix array P is:\n\n      P = [0, a0, a0+a1, ..., a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}]\n\n      Then the last element is at index n (so P has n+1 elements).\n\n      We want to take P from index k to n (inclusive): that is indices k, k+1, ..., n -> n-k+1 elements.\n\n      Similarly, P from 0 to n-k (inclusive) is indices 0 to n-k -> n-k+1 elements.\n\n However, in Python, the slice P[k:] includes indices k, k+1, ... n (since the list has index from 0 to n). Similarly, P[:n-k+1] includes indices 0 to n-k (because the slice goes from 0 to n-k+1-1, i.e., n-k).\n\n But wait, the problem: the second part should be the sum of P[0] to P[n-k] (inclusive). \n\n      Example: n=3, k=2, then n-k=1. Then the second part is P[0] and P[1] (because indices 0 and 1).\n\n      Then part1 = P[2] + P[3] = (a0+a1) + (a0+a1+a2)\n                = (3+4) + (3+4+7) = 7 + 14 = 21\n      part2 = P[0] + P[1] = 0 + 3 = 3\n      total_sleep = 21 - 3 = 18 -> correct.\n\n But wait, in the example, the two weeks are [3,4] (sum=7) and [4,7] (sum=11). And 7+11=18.\n\n However, note: the week [3,4] is represented by P[2]-P[0] = (3+4) - 0 = 7.\n        [4,7] is P[3]-P[1] = (3+4+7) - 3 = 14-3=11.\n\n But the expression we used was: \n        total_sleep = (P[2] + P[3]) - (P[0]+P[1])\n\n Why does that work? Because:\n\n        (P[2]-P[0]) + (P[3]-P[1]) = P[2]+P[3] - (P[0]+P[1])\n\n So the general formula is:\n\n        total_sleep = (sum of P[i] for i from k to n) - (sum of P[i] for i from 0 to n-k)\n\n But note: the indices for the second part are from 0 to n-k (inclusive). \n\n However, there is a catch: the indices we are summing in the second part are from 0 to n-k, and in the first part from k to n.\n\n Now, how to compute the sum of the prefix array from k to n and from 0 to n-k without building a separate array for the prefix of the prefix? \n\n We can build the prefix array P (which is O(n)) and then build a prefix-sum array for P (another O(n)), or we can use built-in functions to sum slices.\n\n But note: the total_sleep is the difference between two sums of parts of the prefix array. The total memory is O(n) and the time is O(n) for building the prefix array and then O(n) for the two slices (each slice is O(n)). \n\n However, we can avoid building the prefix array for the entire array P? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep by:\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_sleep += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n But then we have to build P first, which is O(n). \n\n Since n can be up to 200000, building the prefix array is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem requires high precision and we are dealing with integers, so we can do:\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n      average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n However, the above loop runs (n-k+1) times, which can be up to 200000, so it is acceptable.\n\n But let's compare: \n      Option 1: Build the prefix array (O(n)) and then do a single pass to compute the total_sleep by the formula above (using two slices) is also O(n). \n\n      However, building the prefix array is necessary for the two-slice method.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n        Build the prefix array: O(n)\n        Then: total_sleep = sum(prefix[k:]) - sum(prefix[:n-k+1])   [but wait, the second part should be from index 0 to index n-k (inclusive) which is n-k+1 elements, but in the slice we did earlier we used:\n\n          part1 = sum(prefix[k:])   # from k to n (inclusive) -> n - k + 1 elements\n          part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])   # from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> n-k+1 elements\n\n        But wait, the second part: the slice prefix[:n-k+1] gives from index 0 to n-k (because in Python, the end index is exclusive). \n\n        Actually, we want to include index n-k, so we should set:\n\n          part2 = sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])\n\n        But in the two-slice method, we defined:\n\n          total_sleep = (P[k] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n        In the prefix array P, the indices go from 0 to n.\n\n        So for part2, we want the sum of P from index 0 to index n-k (inclusive). \n\n        That is: indices 0,1,...,n-k.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          part2 = sum(P[0:n-k+1])\n\n        Similarly, part1 = sum(P[k:n+1])\n\n        Then total_sleep = part1 - part2.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, then n-k+1 = 2 (weeks). \n          P = [0, 3, 7, 14]   (for [3,4,7]: P0=0, P1=3, P2=3+4=7, P3=3+4+7=14)\n          part1 = sum(P[2:]) = P2 + P3 = 7+14 = 21\n          part2 = sum(P[0:3-2+1]) = sum(P[0:2]) = P0+P1 = 0+3 = 3\n          total_sleep = 21-3 = 18.\n\n        But wait, the second part should be from index 0 to index n-k (which is 1) -> that is P0 and P1, so two elements. \n\n        However, the number of weeks is n-k+1 = 2, and the second part is the first n-k+1 elements? Actually, the second part is the first n-k+1 elements? \n\n        Let me reexamine the derivation:\n\n          total_sleep = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n]-P[n-k])\n\n          = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n        Here, the second part has n-k+1 terms: from index0 to index n-k.\n\n        But note: the indices in the subtraction are exactly the indices of the first n-k+1 terms of the prefix array.\n\n        So the two-slice method is:\n\n          total_sleep = sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:n-k+1])\n\n        However, in Python, the slice P[k:] goes from index k to the end (n inclusive) and the slice P[:n-k+1] goes from 0 to n-k (inclusive) because the slice stops at n-k+1 (exclusive).\n\n        Actually, the slice P[:n-k+1] includes indices from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So the number of elements is (n-k+1) - 0 = n-k+1.\n\n        But wait: the prefix array has n+1 elements. The indices for the second part are 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> n-k+1 elements.\n\n        The first part: from index k to n (inclusive) -> n - k + 1 elements.\n\n        So the two slices have the same number of elements.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          P = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          total_sleep = sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:n-k+1])\n\n        Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n But note: the entire array a is stored and we are doing two slices on the prefix array, each of which is O(n). So the total time is O(n) and we are using O(n) space.\n\n However, we can also avoid building the entire prefix array and then summing two big slices by using a different method.\n\n Another method: use a sliding window to compute the total_sleep without storing the entire prefix array?\n\n      We can compute the sum of the week i as (prefix[i+k]-prefix[i]), and then add them up.\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n      But we still need the prefix array.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep by:\n\n      total_sleep = (k * total_a) ? No, because each day's value is used in multiple weeks.\n\n Actually, each element a_i is used in (k - i) weeks? Not exactly. \n\n      The element a_i (at index i) is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n      The number of weeks including a_i is: \n          left_bound = max(0, i-k+1)\n          right_bound = min(i, n-k)   [because the week must start at or before i and the week must start at or after 0 and at or before n-k (so that the week ends at i+k-1 <= n-1)]\n\n      Then the count for a_i is: (right_bound - left_bound + 1) \n\n      Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * (count_i)\n\n      But then the average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n      Then we can do:\n\n          count_i = (min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1)   [if the boundaries are inclusive]\n\n      Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n          i=0: count0 = min(0, 3-2) - max(0,0-2+1) + 1 = min(0,1)=0, max(0,-1)=0 -> 0-0+1 = 1.\n          i=1: count1 = min(1,1)=1, max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0 -> 1-0+1 = 2.\n          i=2: count2 = min(2,1)=1, max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1 -> 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n          total_sleep = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      Then we can compute:\n\n          total_sleep = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              right = min(i, n-k)\n              count_i = right - left + 1\n              total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n      Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n      This is also O(n). \n\n      But note: the constraints say n up to 200000, so either way is acceptable.\n\n      Which one is more efficient? The two-slice method with prefix array might require building the prefix array and then two slices, which is O(n) for building the prefix and then two O(n) slices. The counting method is one pass and doesn't require building a prefix array.\n\n      However, the counting method uses two min/max operations per element, which is acceptable.\n\n      Let me compare the two:\n\n        Two-slice method:\n\n          Step 1: Build the prefix array (n+1 elements) -> O(n)\n          Step 2: Compute two slices: each slice is O(n) -> total O(n)\n\n        Counting method:\n\n          Step 1: Iterate through the array once, and for each element do two min and two max (constant time) and one multiplication and addition.\n\n          So O(n) as well.\n\n      But note: the counting method might be faster because we avoid the two large slices (which require traversing the entire list twice) and instead do a single traversal.\n\n      However, the two-slice method is straightforward and clear.\n\n      But wait, the two-slice method requires storing an array of n+1 integers. The counting method only stores the original array and a running total.\n\n      Considering memory: both are O(n). \n\n      But note: the problem says n up to 200000, so 200000 integers is acceptable in memory.\n\n      However, the counting method is more efficient in terms of memory? Actually, the two-slice method uses two arrays (the prefix array and then we store the entire list, but the prefix array is n+1, so total memory is about 2*n+1 integers). The counting method uses only the original array and a few variables.\n\n      Also, the counting method avoids the two large slices, which are expensive in terms of time (two passes of n/2 each, so effectively two passes of n). \n\n      But note: the counting method does one pass of n, and each operation is simple.\n\n      Let me choose the counting method for efficiency.\n\n      However, there is a caveat: the counting method might be less obvious to some, but we are solving competitive programming.\n\n      Steps for counting method:\n\n        Read n, k and list a of n integers.\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            right = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must end by n-1, so the start index must be <= n-k (since the week is k days: start at s, then s+k-1 <= n-1 => s <= n-k)\n            count_i = right - left + 1\n            total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        Format the average to have 10 decimal places.\n\n      But wait, the example: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\n        total_weeks = 1\n        i=0: left = max(0,0-1+1)=max(0,0)=0\n             right = min(0, 1-1)=min(0,0)=0\n             count_0 = 0-0+1=1\n             total_sleep = 10*1 = 10\n        average = 10/1 = 10.0 -> correct.\n\n      Another example: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n        total_weeks = 7\n\n        We'll compute the counts for each i from 0 to 7:\n\n        i=0: left = max(0,0-2+1)=0, right=min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1\n        i=1: left = max(0,1-2+1)=0, right=min(1,6)=1 -> count=2\n        i=2: left = max(0,2-2+1)=1, right=min(2,6)=2 -> count=2\n        i=3: left = max(0,3-2+1)=2, right=min(3,6)=3 -> count=2\n        i=4: left = max(0,4-2+1)=3, right=min(4,6)=4 -> count=2\n        i=5: left = max(0,5-2+1)=4, right=min(5,6)=5 -> count=2\n        i=6: left = max(0,6-2+1)=5, right=min(6,6)=6 -> count=2\n        i=7: left = max(0,7-2+1)=6, right=min(7,6)=6 -> count=1\n\n        Then total_sleep = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n                         = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n                         = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1 = 200000 + (1+4+8+246+912+1578+1) \n                         Let me calculate the rest: 1+4=5; 5+8=13; 13+246=259; 259+912=1171; 1171+1578=2749; 2749+1=2750\n                         total_sleep = 200000 + 2750 = 202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        But the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n        So that matches.\n\n      However, note: the example input is:\n\n          8 2\n          1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\n      Therefore, we can implement the counting method.\n\n      But wait: is the counting method always correct? \n\n        Consider: the week is defined as k consecutive days. The element at index i is included in the weeks that start from s such that s <= i and s >= i-k+1 and s <= n-k.\n\n        The condition s<=i and s>=max(0, i-k+1) and s<=n-k. Then the smallest s is max(0, i-k+1) and the largest s is min(i, n-k). \n\n        Then the number of weeks is min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n      Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Determine the valid range of start indices for weeks that include a[i]\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must end at or before n-1, so start index must be <= n-k (since week is k days: s+k-1 <= n-1 -> s<=n-k)\n            count_i = high - low + 1\n            total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n        # Calculate the average\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n      However, note: the example input may be provided as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n      But wait: what if k is larger than n? The input constraint says 1<=k<=n, so no.\n\n      But note: the counting method might be clearer and more efficient in terms of avoiding extra arrays and two passes.\n\n      However, note: the counting method does a single pass and uses minimal memory.\n\n      Let me run the provided examples.\n\n      Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> total_sleep=3*1+4*2+7*1=3+8+7=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> outputs 9.0000000000.\n\n      Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> 10.0000000000.\n\n      Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> 28964.2857142857.\n\n      But wait, the example output for the third example is given as 28964.2857142857, which matches.\n\n      However, I see that the example input was:\n\n          Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n      And the expected output: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n      But note: 202750 / 7 = 28964.285714285714... so rounding to 10 decimal places is correct.\n\n      We'll format the average to 10 decimal places.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Using float and formatting to 10 decimal places should be sufficient.\n\n      But note: the numbers can be large (n up to 200000, a[i] up to 10^5). The maximum total_sleep is 200000 * 10^5 * (maximum count, which is at most k, but k<=n, so maximum count is k, which is <=200000) -> maximum total_sleep is 200000 * 10^5 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the range of Python floats (which have about 15-16 digits of precision) so no problem.\n\n      However, to be safe, we can use integer arithmetic until the division and then format the float.\n\n      But the division is by an integer (total_weeks) which is at most 200000, so we are safe.\n\n      Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n      One more edge: when k==n, then each element a[i] is included only in the week that starts at max(0, i-n+1) to min(i, n-n)=min(i,0). \n        For i from 0 to n-1:\n          low = max(0, i-n+1) \n          high = min(i,0)\n\n        But if i<n, then for i<n: i-n+1 < 0, so low=0, and high = min(i,0) -> which is 0 if i>=0, but wait: if i=0, then high=0; if i>0, then min(i,0)=0? Only if i<0? \n\n        Actually, k==n, then total_weeks = n - n + 1 = 1.\n\n        For each i:\n          low = max(0, i-n+1) -> for i from 0 to n-1: i-n+1 is negative, so low=0.\n          high = min(i, n-n) = min(i,0) -> since i>=0, then min(i,0)=0 if i==0, but if i>0 then min(i,0)=0? Actually, no: min(i,0) for i>=0 is 0 only when i==0, but wait: when i>=0, then min(i,0) is 0 if i>=0? Actually, no: if i is positive, then min(i,0) is negative? \n\n        Wait, no: n-n is 0, so high = min(i,0). But i is nonnegative, so min(i,0) is 0 only if i>=0? Actually, no: if i>=0, then min(i,0) is 0 only when i==0? Actually, no: min(i,0) returns the minimum of i and 0. If i>=0, then 0 is less than i unless i==0, but wait: if i==0, then min(0,0)=0. If i>=1, then min(i,0)=0? No, wait: 0 is less than i (which is positive) so yes, min(i,0)=0 for any i>=0.\n\n        Then for every i, high=0.\n\n        Then count_i = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n        Then total_sleep = sum(a) * 1.\n\n        Then average = sum(a) / 1 = sum(a). \n\n        Example: n=2, k=2, a=[1,2] -> total_sleep=1+2=3, average=3.0.\n\n        But the weeks: only one week [1,2] -> average=(1+2)/2? Wait, no: the problem says: average over all weeks (there is one week) and the week's total sleep is 3? \n\n        Actually, no: the week",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous subarray of length `k` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all such weeks and then finding the average by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to compute the average sleep time over all weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a sequence of `n` days. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the sum of sleep times for all these weeks without resorting to a brute-force method, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Key Insight**: Each day's sleep time is included in multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position `i` will be part of weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The number of such weeks is `min(i, n - k) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of processing each week individually, we calculate the contribution of each day to the total sleep time by multiplying its value by the number of weeks it appears in. This approach reduces the problem to a single pass over the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sleep = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high_bound = min(i, n - k)\n        count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n        total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by an array `a` of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If there are no weeks (i.e., `k > n`), the output is trivially 0. However, the problem constraints ensure `k ≤ n`, so this case is theoretically impossible but included for completeness.\n3. **Total Sleep Calculation**: For each day `i`, compute the number of weeks that include this day. This is done by determining the valid range of starting indices for these weeks. The contribution of each day to the total sleep time is its sleep duration multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sleep time is divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the average. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid unnecessary computations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
