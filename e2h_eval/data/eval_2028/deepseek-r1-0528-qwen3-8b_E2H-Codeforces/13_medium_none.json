For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the list of 12 notes). But note: the problem lists the notes as starting with C and then going up to H (which is B in some systems, but here H is the last). However, the example includes H and it's considered after B? Actually, the example says: \"after H goes C again\", so the order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n But wait: the example input has \"A B H\". Let's map:\n\n   C -> 0\n   C# -> 1\n   D -> 2\n   D# -> 3\n   E -> 4\n   F -> 5\n   F# -> 6\n   G -> 7\n   G# -> 8\n   A -> 9\n   B -> 10\n   H -> 11\n\n However, the example \"C# B F\": \n   We need to consider that the chord can be reordered. The example says if we order as \"B C# F\", then:\n      B to C#: B is 10, C# is 1. Since the circle is 12 tones, we might need to account for circularity.\n\n Approach:\n   Convert each note to a number (0-11).\n   Then, we have three numbers: a, b, c.\n\n   We want to check for major: there exists an ordering [x, y, z] such that:\n        distance(x, y) = 4, distance(y, z) = 3, and distance(x, z) = 7 (which is 4+3, but note: the circle is 12, so we have to consider modulo)\n\n   Similarly for minor: distance(x, y)=3, distance(y, z)=4, and then x to z is 7 (same as above).\n\n   However, note: the definition doesn't require the entire octave (so 12) but the distances are taken along the musical scale (which is cyclic). But the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" meaning that going from E to C (if E is at 4 and C is at 0) we go from 4 to 11 (which is 7 steps) and then 0, so total 8? Actually, we have to compute the shortest distance? But wait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", but then they give an example of E to C as 8. This implies that the distance is measured in the direction that goes upward until the next occurrence of the higher note? Actually, they say \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", but then the example says \"between E and C\" is 8. \n\n   Let me clarify: In music, the distance between two notes is often taken as the smallest interval (minimal steps) but sometimes the chord definition requires the specific intervals in sequence.\n\n   However, note the example: \n        Major: ordered as X, Y, Z: X->Y:4, Y->Z:3. Then the entire chord spans 7 semitones (which is less than 12, so we don't wrap around).\n\n   But what if we have a chord that requires wrapping? Example: let's take a chord that goes from H to C? \n        H is 11, then C is 0. The direct distance from H to C (without wrapping) would be (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1, but the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". So they are measuring the distance from the lower note to the higher note, but if we cross an octave, then we do wrap? \n\n   But wait: the example says \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\" (from C to E: 0 to 4, 4 semitones) and \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". That means the distance from E to C is not the minimal one (which would be 12-4=8? because from E (at 4) to C (at 0) you can go two ways: \n        Down: from 4 to 0: 4 steps down? but the problem says 8.\n        Up: from 4 to 12 (then to 0): 12-4+0? Actually, from E to the next C: we go from 4 to 12 (which is 8 steps) and then land on C (which is 0). \n\n   So the problem defines the distance from note A to note B as the number of semitones when moving from A to B in the upward direction, possibly wrapping around the octave? \n\n   However, the example for major and minor triads specifies the distances without wrapping (because 4+3=7, which is less than 12). But note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break down:\n\n        Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n        They say: order as B, C#, F: \n            B to C#: from 10 to 1. If we go upward from B (10) to C# (1) we have to go from 10 to 11 (one step) and then 0 to 1 (two more) -> 3 semitones.\n            C# to F: from 1 to 5: 4 semitones.\n\n        How did they get from B to C#? In the circle, the next C# after B is the one that comes after the octave? So the distance from B to C# is (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3? Actually, 1 - 10 is negative, so we add 12: 1-10+12 = 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define a function for the upward distance from note i to note j (in semitones) as:\n            (j - i) % 12   but that gives the minimal positive steps? Not exactly: because if j < i, then (j-i) % 12 = j-i+12, which is the upward distance.\n\n        Example: from E (4) to C (0): (0-4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (since -4 + 12 = 8). So that matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can define the distance from note i to note j (in semitones, upward) as: (j - i) % 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, modulo 12: (j - i) % 12, but note that modulo operation in Python for negative: \n            (0-4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n        So we can use: distance(i, j) = (j - i) % 12, but wait: if we do (j - i) % 12, then for (10 to 1): (1-10)%12 = (-9)%12 = 3, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So we have three notes: a, b, c (as numbers 0-11). We need to check all permutations.\n\n        Conditions for major: There exists a permutation [x, y, z] (which is the sorted order by the circle? but note: the circle is cyclic, so we have to consider circular shifts) such that:\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12 == 4\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12 == 3\n            and also the entire span from x to z should be (z-x)%12 == 7? Actually, we don't need to check the entire span because 4+3=7, but note: the circle might allow multiple possibilities. However, the condition for major is defined by consecutive intervals of 4 and 3.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so that ...\", meaning we are allowed to arrange them in any cyclic order? Actually, no: the arrangement must be in increasing order (by the circle) from x to y to z. However, the circle is cyclic, so we can start anywhere.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the starting point. So we must check all 3! = 6 permutations? But note: the chord is defined by three distinct notes? (since a chord is an unordered set of three notes, and the examples have distinct notes). \n\n        However, the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So we assume distinct.\n\n        Steps:\n          1. Map the three input notes to numbers.\n          2. Generate all permutations of these three numbers (there are 6).\n          3. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n                Check if (y - x) % 12 == 4 and (z - y) % 12 == 3 -> then major found.\n                Or if (y - x) % 12 == 3 and (z - y) % 12 == 4 -> then minor found.\n\n          4. If we find one major, output \"major\".\n          5. If we find one minor, output \"minor\".\n          6. Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the entire chord must be contained in the circle without exceeding 12? The condition for the intervals (4 and 3) naturally leads to a total of 7, which is less than 12, so no wrapping beyond the immediate three notes? But wait, what if the three notes are not consecutive? \n\n        Example: the chord \"C E G\" is major. \n          C(0), E(4), G(7)\n          Check: \n            Ordering: [0,4,7]: \n                (4-0)%12 = 4 -> matches major first condition.\n                (7-4)%12 = 3 -> matches major second condition.\n\n        Example: minor chord \"C Eb G\" (which is minor): \n          C(0), Eb(3), G(7)\n          Check ordering [0,3,7]:\n                (3-0)%12 = 3, (7-3)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n        But what about the same chord in different order? For example, the major chord \"C E G\" can also be written as [4,7,0] (if we start at E)? \n          [4,7,0]: (7-4)%12=3, (0-7)%12 = (0-7+12)%12=5 -> not 4 or 3.\n\n        Actually, the ordering must be the one that goes in increasing order without skipping the entire circle? \n\n        The problem does not specify the starting point, but the ordering must be such that the entire chord is traversed without wrapping (i.e., the notes must appear consecutively in the circle in that order). \n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\" is minor. They reordered as \"B C# F\". So we must consider the circular nature.\n\n        How do we handle circularity? The problem says the scale is cyclic. So we can also consider the notes in a circular list. \n\n        Alternate approach: since the circle has 12 notes, we can fix a starting point and then check the three possible starting points? Or we can consider the circular arrangement.\n\n        But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. The ordering is arbitrary, but the distances are computed in the upward direction (so from the lower note to the higher note, even if that means going through the octave). \n\n        However, the definition of the chord does not require the notes to be in a single octave? Actually, the example \"C# B F\" uses two octaves? No, the notes are just three distinct pitches.\n\n        Important: The problem says the notes are repeated cyclically, so we have 12 distinct pitch classes. We are only concerned with the pitch class (modulo 12). \n\n        Therefore, the mapping to 0-11 is sufficient.\n\n        Now, the issue: how to check the ordering? We have three distinct numbers: a, b, c. We can consider the circle and the gaps.\n\n        Another way: sort the three numbers (but note: circularly, we can have two ways to sort). However, we can consider the following:\n\n        We can fix one note and then look at the two intervals to the next two notes. But the problem allows any starting point and then the next two in the circle.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let the three numbers be x, y, z (we have all six permutations, but we can also consider the circle: the chord can be represented by the three gaps between the notes when arranged in order (on the circle)). \n\n        However, the problem's condition is very specific: the consecutive intervals must be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        But note: the entire circle is 12, so the three gaps must sum to 12. And we have two gaps: the two intervals we are checking (4 and 3) and the third gap (from z back to x) must be 12 - (4+3) = 5. \n\n        However, the condition does not require the entire circle, just the two consecutive intervals. \n\n        But wait: the chord is defined by three notes, and we are taking the consecutive intervals in the ordering. The ordering must be the one that traverses the circle without the third gap being used? \n\n        Actually, the definition says: \"If we can order the notes so that the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z equals 3 semitones\". \n\n        This ordering is linear (not circular) in the sense of the circle? Meaning, we are allowed to break the circle and consider the three notes as three consecutive ones? \n\n        But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: 1, 10, 5. \n            When ordered as B (10), C# (1), F (5): \n                From B to C#: 3 semitones (as computed: (1-10)%12= -9%12=3)\n                From C# to F: (5-1)%12=4.\n\n            However, the entire chord: from B to F is (5-10)%12 = -5%12=7, but the chord definition does not require that? It only requires two consecutive intervals.\n\n        But note: the definition says \"unordered set\", so we can choose the order arbitrarily. However, the two intervals must be consecutive in the circle? \n\n        Actually, the chord is built from three notes, and we are allowed to arrange them in the circle arbitrarily. The condition for major/minor is that the three notes form two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) when arranged in a specific order (which might be non-contiguous in the linear representation? but the circle is cyclic).\n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\" is minor. The ordering they chose is B, C#, F. In the circle, if we start at B, then C# is the next note (3 semitones up) and then F is 4 semitones above C#. But note: from B to C# is 3 semitones, and from C# to F is 4 semitones, and then from F to B? That would be (10-5)%12=5, but that's not used.\n\n        So the condition is: we can arrange the three notes in a cyclic order (but the chord is defined by two consecutive steps). \n\n        Therefore, the method of checking all 6 permutations is valid.\n\n        However, note: the circle is cyclic, so we might also consider the same permutation but starting at a different point? But our permutations are all distinct orders. \n\n        Example: the major chord \"C E G\": \n          Permutations: \n            [0,4,7]: (4-0)%12=4, (7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n            [0,7,4]: (7-0)%12=7, (4-7)%12= (4-7+12)%12=9 -> not 4 or 3.\n            [4,0,7]: (0-4)%12=8, (7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n            [4,7,0]: (7-4)%12=3, (0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n            [7,0,4]: (0-7)%12=5, (4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n            [7,4,0]: (4-7)%12=9, (0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n        So only one permutation works.\n\n        But wait: what if we consider the circle and the fact that the chord is cyclic? Actually, the problem does not require the entire chord to be contiguous in the circle, but the two intervals must be consecutive in the chosen ordering.\n\n        Another example: the chord \"D F# A\" (which is a major chord). \n            D(2), F#(6), A(9)\n            Check [2,6,9]: (6-2)%12=4, (9-6)%12=3 -> major.\n\n        What about the same chord but in a different representation? For example, the chord \"Ab F A\" (if we use flats) but we are using sharps. Let's stick to the given note names.\n\n        But note: the input can have any of the 12 notes. We map as above.\n\n        However, what if the chord wraps around the circle more than once? Actually, the distances are modulo 12, so we are only concerned with the relative positions.\n\n        One more example: a minor chord that wraps around. Consider the chord \"B D F#\". \n            B(10), D(2), F#(6)\n            We need to order: \n                Option: [10,2,6]: (2-10)%12= (2-10+12)%12=4, (6-2)%12=4 -> not 3.\n                Option: [10,6,2]: (6-10)%12= (6-10+12)%12=8, (2-6)%12= (2-6+12)%12=8 -> no.\n                Option: [2,6,10]: (6-2)%12=4, (10-6)%12=4 -> no.\n                Option: [2,10,6]: (10-2)%12=8, (6-10)%12=8 -> no.\n                Option: [6,2,10]: (2-6)%12= (2-6+12)%12=8, (10-2)%12=8 -> no.\n                Option: [6,10,2]: (10-6)%12=4, (2-10)%12=4 -> no.\n\n            So this chord is not major nor minor? \n\n            But wait: the chord \"B D F#\" is actually a diminished chord (intervals: 4, 3, 3). So it is strange.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          Step 1: Map the input string to three numbers (0-11).\n\n          Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations.\n\n          Step 3: For each permutation (x,y,z):\n                    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                    But wait: the condition for the entire chord? The definition says the two intervals must be consecutive. However, note that the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals and then the third interval (from x to z) is not used in the condition. But note: the condition does not require the entire chord to be in one octave? Actually, the example \"C# B F\" uses two octaves? No, the notes are just three distinct pitches.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale\" and the example from E to C is 8. So we are using the upward distance (wrapping if necessary).\n\n          But the condition for major is: \n              (y - x) % 12 == 4 and (z - y) % 12 == 3\n\n          Similarly for minor.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not specify that the entire chord must be within one octave. The condition is purely on the two consecutive intervals.\n\n          But wait: what if the two intervals (4 and 3) are in the circle but the third interval (from x to z) is not 7? \n\n          Actually, the third interval (from x to z) is (z-x)%12, which is (4+3)%12=7. So the entire chord spans 7 semitones. But the circle is 12, so the chord is contained in 7 semitones. \n\n          However, the example \"C# B F\" is minor: \n            B to C#: 3, C# to F:4, and then from B to F: (5-10+12)%12= (5-10)= -5+12=7. So the entire chord is 7 semitones as well.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is symmetric: the two consecutive intervals (whether 4 then 3 or 3 then 4) always sum to 7.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require the entire chord to be consecutive in the circle without gaps? It only requires the two consecutive intervals.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"the chord is an unordered set\", and we are allowed to pick any ordering. So we are effectively looking for an ordering that yields two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (in that order) or 3 and 4 (in that order).\n\n        Code:\n\n          notes = ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n          mapping = {note: index for index, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\n          Read input string, split, and map each note to its index.\n\n          Then, generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\n          For each permutation (a,b,c):\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit (or break out and remember we found one)\n\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit\n\n          Then, if none found, print \"strange\"\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is major or minor but the intervals are negative? We are using modulo 12, so negative becomes positive. \n\n        However, we must consider: the modulo operation in Python for negative: \n            (b - a) % 12: if b < a, then (b-a) is negative, and (b-a)%12 = (b-a+12) % 12, which is the positive representation.\n\n        This matches the requirement: the upward distance.\n\n        However, note: the condition for major is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3. But what if we have a chord that is major but the two intervals are 4 and 3 but in the opposite direction? \n\n        Example: the chord \"C E G\" is major. What if we consider the ordering [E, G, C]? \n            E(4), G(7), C(0)\n            d1 = (7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12= (0-7+12)%12=5 -> doesn't match.\n\n        But note: the definition says \"If we can order the notes so that the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z equals 3 semitones\". \n\n        The ordering must be from the lowest to the highest? Or can we start at any note? \n\n        The example \"C E G\": \n            We can start at C (0), then E(4) is 4 semitones above, then G(7) is 3 above E.\n\n        But if we start at E, then we cannot get the major pattern because the next note (G) is only 3 semitones above E, and then from G to C is 5 semitones (which is not 3). \n\n        The problem does not specify that the ordering must be from the lowest to the highest. It says \"order the notes\". \n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\" is minor: they started at B (the highest note in the circle? Actually, B is 10, then C# is 1 (which is lower) so they went upward from B to C# (which is the next note in the circle). \n\n        This suggests that the ordering is by the circle (cyclic) and we can start at any note and then move forward (upward) in the circle.\n\n        Therefore, the ordering is not necessarily by pitch class value. \n\n        Our method of using the circle (with modulo 12) is capturing the upward distance correctly.\n\n        However, note: the condition for major requires two consecutive upward intervals: 4 and then 3. \n\n        But what if the chord is major but the two intervals are 4 and 3, but the third interval is not 7? Actually, the third interval (from the first to the last) is (last-first)%12, which is (3+4)%12=7. So the entire chord spans 7 semitones.\n\n        Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is major but the two intervals are 4 and 3, but the last interval is not 7 because we are wrapping? \n\n        Example: consider the chord \"B D# F#\", which is a diminished chord? Actually, let me check: \n            B(10), D#(3), F#(6)\n            We want to check if it is major/minor.\n\n        Let me try to order: \n            [10,3,6]: \n                d1 = (3-10)%12 = (3-10+12)%12=5\n                d2 = (6-3)%12=3 -> not 4.\n\n            [10,6,3]:\n                d1 = (6-10)%12= (6-10+12)%12=8\n                d2 = (3-6)%12= (3-6+12)%12=9\n\n            [3,10,6]:\n                d1 = (10-3)%12=7\n                d2 = (6-10)%12=8\n\n            [3,6,10]:\n                d1 = (6-3)%12=3\n                d2 = (10-6)%12=4 -> minor? \n\n            [3,6,10]: \n                Condition for minor: d1==3 and d2==4 -> yes, so it would be minor.\n\n        But wait: the chord \"B D# F#\" is actually a minor chord? \n            Intervals: from B to D# is 3 semitones (B to C is 1, C to C# is 2, C# to D is 3, D to D# is 4 -> wait, no. Let me count from B to D#: \n                B -> C (1), C->C#(2), C#->D(3), D->D#(4) -> that's 4 semitones? Actually, no: \n                The note B is 10, then the next notes are: 11 (H) and then 0 (C), then 1 (C#) ... so from B(10) to D#(3) in upward direction: \n                We go from 10 to 11 (1), then 0, 1, 2, 3 -> that's 1 (for 10->11) and then 3 (from 0 to 3) -> total 4 semitones.\n\n            Then from D#(3) to F#(6): 6-3=3 semitones.\n\n            So the chord has intervals: 4 and 3, which is major? But we found a permutation [3,6,10] that gives 3 and 4 (minor). \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n            But wait: the chord \"B D# F#\" is actually a diminished chord? Because the intervals are 4, 3, and then from F# to B: (10-6)%12=4, so the intervals are 4, 3, 4. That is not a major or minor (which require 7 semitones total). \n\n            However, we found one ordering that fits minor? Why?\n\n            Let me check the condition for minor: the consecutive intervals must be 3 and then 4. \n            In the ordering [3,6,10]: \n                Start at D#(3), then F#(6): 3 semitones (correct for minor first interval)\n                Then from F#(6) to B(10): (10-6)%12=4 semitones (correct for minor second interval)\n\n            But wait, the entire chord is built from three notes: D#, F#, B. The intervals are 3 and 4, so minor. \n\n            However, the entire chord spans (from D# to B): (10-3)%12=7 semitones, so it is a minor chord? \n\n            Actually, the standard minor chord is built on the root note. The chord \"D# F# B\" is indeed a minor chord (with root D#). \n\n            But wait, the problem says the chord is an unordered set. So the chord can be classified by any root? \n\n            The definition does not specify a root. It only specifies the existence of an ordering (any) that satisfies the conditions.\n\n            Therefore, the chord \"B D# F#\" is minor because the ordering [D#, F#, B] satisfies the minor condition.\n\n            However, is that correct? Let me check with music theory: \n                A minor chord is built as root, then +3, +7 (which is 3+4). \n\n                D# minor: D# (root), then D# + 3 semitones: D# + 3 = F# (because D# to E is 1, E to F is 2, F to F# is 3? Actually, from D# to F#: \n                    D# -> E (1), E->F(2), F->F#(3) -> so F# is the third. Then the fifth is D# + 7 semitones: D# (3) +7 = 10, which is B. \n\n                So the chord D# minor is {D#, F#, B}. \n\n            Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the same chord has two different orderings that yield major and minor? The problem states: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning there are no such chords.\n\n        Therefore, we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        However, we must check all permutations until we find one. But if we find a major, we output \"major\" and stop. Similarly for minor.\n\n        But note: the same chord might satisfy both conditions? \n\n        Example: can we have a chord that has two different orderings: one giving 4 then 3 and another giving 3 then 4? \n\n        Condition for major: (y-x)%12=4 and (z-y)%12=3.\n        Condition for minor: (y-x)%12=3 and (z-y)%12=4.\n\n        These are different. But what if the chord has two different sets of consecutive intervals? \n\n        Example: let the chord be (0,4,7) -> major: [0,4,7] -> 4 then 3. \n                 Can we also get minor? \n                    [0,4,7]: minor condition: 3 and then 4 -> 3 and 4: (4-0)%12=4 !=3 -> fails.\n                    [0,7,4]: 7 then 4: (7-0)%12=7, (4-7)%12=9 -> no.\n                    [4,0,7]: (0-4)%12=8, (7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n                    [4,7,0]: (7-4)%12=3, (0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,4]: (0-7)%12=5, (4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n                    [7,4,0]: (4-7)%12=9, (0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n        So no.\n\n        Another example: the chord (0,3,7) -> minor: [0,3,7]: 3 then 4 -> minor. \n                 Check major: \n                    [0,3,7]: 3 then 4 -> not 4 then 3.\n                    [0,7,3]: 7 then (3-7+12)=8 -> no.\n                    [3,0,7]: (0-3+12)=9, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n                    [3,7,0]: (7-3)=4, (0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,3]: (0-7+12)=5, (3-0)=3 -> no.\n                    [7,3,0]: (3-7+12)=8, (0-3+12)=9 -> no.\n\n        So no.\n\n        Therefore, we can safely check all 6 permutations and output the first match.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to break as soon as we find one.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          notes_list = ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n          note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n\n          s = input().split()\n          a, b, c = [note_to_index[note] for note in s]\n\n          perms = [(a,b,c), (a,c,b), (b,a,c), (b,c,a), (c,a,b), (c,b,a)]\n\n          found_major = False\n          found_minor = False\n\n          for p in perms:\n              x, y, z = p\n              d1 = (y - x) % 12\n              d2 = (z - y) % 12\n              if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                  print(\"major\")\n                  exit(0)\n              elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                  print(\"minor\")\n                  exit(0)\n\n          print(\"strange\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input is three space-separated notes. We assume the input has exactly three.\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: Input \"C E G\"\n            notes: ['C','E','G'] -> [0,4,7]\n            Check permutation (0,4,7): d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n          Example 2: Input \"C# B F\"\n            notes: ['C#','B','F'] -> [1,10,5]\n            We need to check if any permutation gives 3 and then 4 (minor) or 4 and then 3 (major). \n            One of the permutations is (10,1,5): \n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12=3\n                d2 = (5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n          Example 3: Input \"A B H\"\n            notes: ['A','B','H'] -> [9,10,11]\n            Check permutations: \n                (9,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval conditions for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to a unique index (0 to 11) based on its position in the musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. The intervals are computed using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Classifying the Chord**: If any permutation has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (in that order), the chord is classified as major. If any permutation has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones (in that order), the chord is classified as minor. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    a, b, c = [note_to_index[note] for note in data]\n    \n    perms = [\n        (a, b, c),\n        (a, c, b),\n        (b, a, c),\n        (b, c, a),\n        (c, a, b),\n        (c, b, a)\n    ]\n    \n    for x, y, z in perms:\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_list` defines the order of musical notes starting from C to H. The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each note to its respective position (0 to 11).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding indices.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: All six possible orderings of the three input notes are generated to check every potential sequence.\n4. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to ensure correct handling of the circular musical scale.\n5. **Chord Classification**: The code checks if any permutation meets the major chord condition (intervals of 4 and 3 semitones) or the minor chord condition (intervals of 3 and 4 semitones). If found, it prints \"major\" or \"minor\" respectively. If no permutation meets these conditions, it prints \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
