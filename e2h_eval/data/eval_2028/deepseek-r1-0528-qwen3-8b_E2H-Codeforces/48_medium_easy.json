He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b (each between 2 and 25) or one integer and then an 'R' for the second part.\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a. The length of this string is at most 1000, but the number might be very large (if base is small and there are many digits) so we have to be careful.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the second token is 'R', then we need to convert the given base-a number to an integer (in base 10), then convert that integer to a Roman numeral string.\n    - Note: The input number in base a may contain leading zeros, but we are guaranteed it's non-negative and if it's Roman then the number is <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n 2. Otherwise, both a and b are integers (bases). Then we convert the given base-a string to a base-b representation.\n\n However, note: the problem says that if it's not Roman, the number won't be greater than 10^1510, meaning it can be extremely large. But wait, the input string has at most 1000 digits. So the base conversion from base a to base b must be done carefully because the number in base 10 could be huge (but note: the base is at least 2 and at most 25, and the string length is up to 1000). \n\n But note: the example includes base 12 to base 13 with digit 'A'. So we have to handle bases up to 25, which means digits from '0' to 'Z'? Actually, for bases above 10, we use letters as per the problem: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n However, note that the input number in base a is given as a string. We cannot convert a 1000-digit number in base 25 to an integer in base 10 because that number would be astronomically huge (unless we use big integers, but Python can handle big integers). But the problem says that in non-Roman cases the number is not greater than 10^1510, but wait, 10^1510 is a very big number, but note that the input string has at most 1000 digits. The maximum value for base 25 with 1000 digits is 25**1000, which is way bigger than 10^1510. However, the problem states: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\" — wait, actually the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". So we have to be cautious.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000.\"\n\n However, the guarantee for non-Roman cases is that the number is not greater than 10^1510. That means we can convert the base-a string to a base-10 integer only if the base is small enough and the number is within the limit? Actually, we don't know the base a (which is between 2 and 25) and the string length is up to 1000. The maximum value for base 2 is 2^1000, which is about 10^300, and 10^300 is less than 10^1510? Actually, 10^1510 is a 1 followed by 1510 zeros, while 2^1000 is about 10^(1000 * log10(2)) ~ 10^300. So for base 2, 1000 digits is about 10^300, which is less than 10^1510. Similarly, base 25: 25^1000 = (10 * 2.5)^1000 = 10^1000 * (2.5)^1000. (2.5)^1000 is about 10^(1000 * log10(2.5)) ~ 10^(1000 * 0.4) = 10^400. So 25^1000 is 10^1000 * 10^400 = 10^1400, which is still less than 10^1510. So the entire number is within the representable range for Python integers? But wait, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, and we are converting a base-a string of up to 1000 digits to an integer. The maximum integer we can convert without using modular arithmetic or other tricks is limited by the system, but 10^1510 is too big for standard integers in some languages, but Python can handle integers of arbitrary size. However, the problem says the non-Roman numbers are not greater than 10^1510, so we can safely convert the base-a string to an integer (base-10) if we are going to do base-b conversion? But wait, the problem also says that the base-b conversion might be required.\n\n However, note: we have two cases: \n   Case 1: b is 'R' -> convert base-a string to base-10 integer, then to Roman.\n   Case 2: b is an integer -> we have to convert base-a string to base-b representation.\n\n But the base-b representation might be for a base that is very small (like 2) and the number is huge (with 1000 digits in base 25). We cannot convert the entire base-a string to base-10 if the base is 2 and the string is 1000 digits because 2^1000 is a number with about 300 decimal digits, which is acceptable in Python (since Python integers are arbitrary precision). But wait, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 decimal digits, and 2^1000 is about 300 digits, so the guarantee that the number is <= 10^1510 is to ensure that we don't get numbers that are too big for the problem (like base 2 with 1000 digits is 2^1000 which is about 1e300, which is acceptable).\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning the actual numeric value (in base 10) is <= 10^1510. So if we convert the base-a string to base-10, we might get a number that is too big to represent in memory? Actually, 10^1510 has 1511 digits, and Python can handle that, but we must be cautious because the input string is base-a (with a between 2 and 25) and the length is 1000. The maximum value in base a=25 is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510, so it's safe.\n\n However, let me clarify: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". This is the base-10 representation of the number. So we can convert the base-a string to a base-10 integer and then convert that integer to base b (if b is an integer) or to Roman.\n\n But wait: what if the base is 2 and the string is 1000 digits? Then the base-10 integer would be 2^1000, which is about 300 digits. Then converting that to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25) might require converting a 300-digit decimal number to base b. That is feasible because the number is 2^1000 (which is fixed) but the base conversion algorithm for such a big number (even though the base is small) would iterate over the digits? Actually, we can avoid converting to base-10 if we do the conversion from base-a to base-b directly, especially because the base-b representation might be more compact and we don't want to work with very big numbers unnecessarily.\n\n However, note that the problem says the number in base a is given as a string. We can convert the base-a string to base-10 integer, then from base-10 to base-b. But the base-10 integer might be too big for efficient conversion to base-b? Actually, the base-10 integer has at most 1511 digits (if the base is 10, then 10^1510 is a 1511-digit number). Converting a 1511-digit base-10 number to base b (which is at most 25) would require 1511 * (log_b(10^1510)) steps? Actually, we can use a standard conversion method:\n\n   num = 0\n   for digit in base_a_string:\n        num = num * a + int(digit)   [if the digit is a digit] or use mapping for letters? But wait, the base-a string can have digits that are letters? The problem says: \"the input number in base a\" and the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> so base 12, and the digit 'A' represents 10.\n\n But note: the input string for base a might contain digits that are letters. How are the digits represented? The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n However, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. And the representation uses digits that are either '0'-'9' and then 'A' (for 10) and so on. But note: the problem does not specify the exact set of digits. Since a is between 2 and 25, we can use:\n\n   If the base a is <= 10, then the digits are from '0' to str(a-1)\n   If a > 10, then we use digits '0' to '9' and then 'A' to the letter representing (a-1). For example, base 16: digits are '0' to 'F'.\n\n But the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\".\n\n So we have to map each character in the string to a digit value. The mapping is:\n   '0' -> 0, ... '9' -> 9, then 'A'->10, 'B'->11, ... up to the base a.\n\n However, the input string is in base a, so we must check that the digits are valid. But the problem says it's given in base a.\n\n Steps for base conversion (non-Roman):\n\n   Step 1: Convert the base-a string to a base-10 integer (if we are going to use the base-10 integer for further conversion to base b). But wait, if we are going to output base b, and the base-10 integer might be huge (up to 10^1510, which is a 1511-digit number) then converting that to base b (which is at most 25) would require a lot of divisions. However, 10^1510 is a 1511-digit number, and base 25: the number of digits in base 25 is about log_{25}(10^1510) = 1510 * log10(10) / log10(25) = 1510 / 1.4 approx 1078 digits. So the output string for base b will be at most 1078 digits. \n\n   Alternatively, we can convert the base-a string to base-b without going through base-10. We can use the following method:\n\n      We can convert the base-a string to a base-10 integer, but if the base is small (like 2) and the string is 1000 digits, the base-10 integer is about 2^1000 (which is acceptable). However, if the base is 25 and the string is 1000 digits, then the base-10 integer is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, which is also acceptable in Python (though it's a big number). \n\n   But note: the problem says the non-Roman number is at most 10^1510, so base-10 integer representation is acceptable.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the input string might have digits beyond '9', i.e., letters. We must map these letters to their corresponding values.\n\n   Steps for converting base-a string (with possible letters) to base-10 integer:\n\n        Let s = the input string.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            num = 0\n            for char in s:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                num = num * a + d\n\n        But note: the problem says the base a is at most 25, so if we encounter a letter, say 'A', then a must be at least 11. Also, if the base is 11, then the digits allowed are '0' to '10', but the digit 'A' represents 10, which is valid for base 11.\n\n   Then, if the second token is an integer b, we need to convert the base-10 integer `num` to base b.\n\n   How to convert base-10 integer to base b?\n\n        If num is 0, then output \"0\".\n        Otherwise, we do:\n\n            digits = []\n            n = num\n            while n:\n                r = n % b\n                digits.append(r)\n                n //= b\n\n            Then reverse the digits and map each digit to the corresponding character.\n\n        But note: we have to map digits 0-9 to '0'-'9', and digits 10 and above to letters starting from 'A'. However, the base b is between 2 and 25, so the maximum digit is 24, so we need up to 'Y' (if we use 0-25: 0='0', 10='A', 11='B', ... 24='Y').\n\n        But wait: what if the base is 16? Then we need to map 10 to 'A', 11 to 'B', ..., 15 to 'F'. That matches.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the problem says the input number might be 0. In the Roman case, we are told the number won't be 0. But in the non-Roman case, the input number is non-negative and may be 0. The problem says: \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n   Example: if the input is \"2 2\\n0\", then output should be \"0\".\n\n   But note: the input string for base a might have leading zeros. When converting the base-a string to base-10, we must consider that the entire string is the number. However, the base-10 integer 0 is represented by the empty string? No, the input string is non-negative and may be 0. The problem says the input string may contain leading zeros. So we have to read the entire string and convert it.\n\n   However, if the base-a string is \"0\", then the base-10 integer is 0.\n\n   But what if the base-a string is \"00\"? Then the base-10 integer is 0.\n\n   So we have to consider: the input string can be all zeros? Then the base-10 integer is 0.\n\n   Then when converting 0 to base b, we output \"0\".\n\n   But note: the problem says \"omit leading zeros\", so if the number is 0, we output \"0\".\n\n   Now, what if the base-a string is empty? The problem says the length doesn't exceed 1000, but it could be 0? The problem says non-negative integer, and the input string is the representation. The problem says \"its length doesn't exceed 1000\", so we assume at least one digit? Or could it be empty? The example input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> so at least one digit.\n\n   According to the problem: the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a. So it must be at least one digit.\n\n   So algorithm for non-Roman:\n\n        Read a and b (as integers) from the first line.\n        Read the string s.\n\n        # Convert s from base a to base-10 integer.\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            # Check if d is within [0, a-1]? The problem guarantees the input is valid, so we don't need to validate.\n            num = num * a + d\n\n        # Now convert base-10 integer num to base b.\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = num\n            while n:\n                digits.append(n % b)\n                n //= b\n\n            # Now, we have the digits in reverse order, so we reverse and map each digit to a character.\n            # We need to map digits from 0 to b-1 to characters. For digits < 10, we use the digit itself, for >=10 we use letters starting from 'A'\n            s_digits = []\n            for d in reversed(digits):\n                if d < 10:\n                    s_digits.append(str(d))\n                else:\n                    s_digits.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n\n            # Combine the list into a string and output.\n            print(''.join(s_digits))\n\n   But wait, there is an alternative: we can avoid converting to base-10 by doing the conversion from base a to base b directly. Why? Because the base-10 integer might be very big (like 10^1510) and converting that to base b (which is 2 to 25) requires many divisions, but the base-10 integer is already stored as a big integer and the division is efficient? Actually, the base-10 integer has at most 1511 digits, so the number of digits in base b is about 1511 * (log10(a)) / (log10(b))? Actually, no: the base-10 integer is fixed, and we are just doing base conversion from base 10 to base b. The number of digits in base b is floor(log_b(num)) + 1. The worst-case num is 10^1510, which is about 10^1510, so the base b representation will have about 1510 * (log10(10)) / log10(b) = 1510 / log10(b) digits. For base 2, that's 1510 / 0.3010 ~ 5016 digits. But wait, 10^1510 in base 2: 2^x = 10^1510 -> x = 1510 * log2(10) ~ 1510 * 3.32 ~ 5013 digits. But note: our base-10 integer is the result of the base-a string. The base-a string is in base a (from 2 to 25) and has up to 1000 digits, so the base-10 integer is at most 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, so base b representation (base 2) would be about 1400 * log2(25) ~ 1400 * 4.64 ~ 6500 digits. This is acceptable because the problem says the input string length is at most 1000, and the base-10 integer is at most 10^1510, so the base b representation is at most around 5000 digits (which is acceptable in Python).\n\n   However, the problem says the base-a string may have leading zeros, but the base-10 integer conversion handles that correctly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the non-Roman number is not greater than 10^1510. So the base-10 integer is at most 10^1510.\n\n   However, there is another issue: the base-10 integer might be too big for the system if we use the direct conversion? But 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait, what if the base is 2 and the string is 1000 digits? Then the base-10 integer is 2^1000, which is about 300 digits, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem states that the non-Roman number is <= 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   But note: the problem also says that the Roman numeral case has the number <= 300010 and not zero. So the base-10 integer for Roman is at most 300010, which is 6 digits, so we can handle that separately.\n\n   However, we are already converting the base-a string to base-10 integer. For the Roman case, the base-10 integer is at most 300010, so that's acceptable.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if the second token is 'R':\n            num = base-a string to base-10 integer (as above)\n            convert num to Roman numeral (using the standard rules, but note: the problem says the number is positive and <= 300010)\n\n        else:\n            num = base-a string to base-10 integer\n            convert num to base b (as above)\n\n   But wait: what if the base-a string is \"0\" and the second token is 'R'? Then the problem says the Roman numeral case: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\". So we don't have to worry about 0 in the Roman case.\n\n   However, the input might be:\n\n        \"2 2\\n0\"\n\n   Then we are in non-Roman case, and we output \"0\".\n\n   But what if the input is:\n\n        \"10 R\\n0\"\n\n   Then according to the problem, this case (with 0) is not allowed for Roman, because the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\".\n\n   So we don't have to handle 0 in the Roman case.\n\n   Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        We are given a base-10 integer num (positive and <= 300010) and we need to convert it to Roman.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals: use the subtractive notation for 4 and 9, and for multiples.\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4),\n                ('I', 1)\n            ]\n\n            Then:\n\n                def to_roman(n):\n                    res = ''\n                    for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                        # While n >= value, subtract value and append numeral\n                        count = n // value\n                        res += numeral * count\n                        n -= value * count\n                        if n == 0:\n                            break\n                    return res\n\n        But wait, the problem says the number is up to 300010. Our standard Roman numerals go up to 3999 (usually). However, the problem says up to 300010, so we need to extend.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        And note: the example includes numbers up to 300010. But the standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 5000 or more. However, sometimes they use a bar above a symbol to multiply by 1000, but the problem doesn't specify that. \n\n        The problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that was for the base-a and base-b representation, not for Roman.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again, it says: \"Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: ...\", and then describes the subtractive principle. It does not mention any extension beyond 3999.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is up to 300010. So we need to represent numbers beyond 3999.\n\n        One common way is to put a bar above a numeral to mean 1000 times. But the problem does not specify that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use multiple Ms: for example, 4000 is MMMM, but 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 could be written as CCCCCCC... (300 Cs) but that is not practical.\n\n        Another way: sometimes, 5000 is represented by (V) or something, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        However, looking at the examples: the input \"16 R\\n5\" gives \"V\", and \"5 R\\n4\" gives \"IV\". There is no example beyond 3999.\n\n        The problem says the number is at most 300010. We must represent 300010.\n\n        Standard way: \n          300010 = 300000 + 10.\n\n        How to represent 300000? We can use three hundred thousands. But in standard Roman, we don't have a symbol for 100000. However, sometimes 100000 is represented as C with a bar (which is 100000). But the problem does not specify.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed\", meaning only for the existing symbols. And the symbols are M, C, X, I (and their multiples by five: L, D).\n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended system, we must assume that the number is less than 4000? But wait, 300010 is greater than 4000.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\".\n\n        After re‐reading: the problem statement says \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that's for the base-a and base-b representation. The Roman numeral system here is described as the standard one, but extended to numbers up to 300010.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended system, we must use the standard method and hope that the input numbers are within the standard Roman numeral range (<=3999) OR the problem intended to use the standard system and the input 300010 is a mistake? Or maybe they use a different system.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be using the additive system for larger numbers: for example, 50000 is (((L)))*10000? But that is not standard.\n\n        After checking the example: the example inputs are small.\n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, and 300000 is 3*100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Another idea: the problem says the base-a number is converted to base-10, then to base-b or Roman. The base-10 number is the same as the usual base-10 system.\n\n        But note: the problem says the Roman numeral system is the standard one, but the standard one doesn't have a defined way to write numbers beyond 3999. However, sometimes people use:\n\n          5000: (V)   (but that is not standard)\n          100000: (C) with a bar, but again, not standard.\n\n        The problem says: \"write it in base b\" — but for Roman, base b is not defined. The Roman numeral system is independent of base.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, let's look at the constraints: the Roman number is at most 300010.\n\n        We can break the number into:\n\n          300010 = 300000 + 10\n\n        But how to write 300000? In standard Roman, we can write MMMMMMMMM... (three hundred thousand M's) but that is 300000 M's, which is too long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the modern extended system: \n\n          Sometimes, 5000 is represented by (V) and 10000 by (X), but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        However, note that the problem says: \"the Roman empire\", and the Roman numerals were used until about 14th century, and they didn't have numbers beyond 3999.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010. This is a modern problem, so they might allow an extended system.\n\n        Looking at the example outputs: they are small. \n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n        And the example inputs: \n            Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> Output: \"V\"\n            Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output: \"IV\"\n\n        There's no example with a large number.\n\n        Considering the competition problem, likely they expect the standard Roman numerals for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, they might use a different representation? Or perhaps the input for Roman will never exceed 3999? But the problem says up to 300010.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have a typo and meant up to 3000? But 3000 is within 3999.\n\n        But 300010 is 300010, which is 300000+10. \n\n        Another possibility: the problem intended to say that the number is at most 3000? Then 3000 is less than 4000.\n\n        However, the problem says 300010.\n\n        Let me check the sample input: \n            ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n        There's no large Roman numeral example.\n\n        Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the constraints say up to 300010, we have to decide:\n\n        Option 1: Use the standard system and only represent numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, output an error? But the problem guarantees the number is <=300010.\n\n        Option 2: Extend the Roman numerals. One common extension is to use parentheses for thousands. For example, 50 is L, 50000 is (L) or 50000 = L with a bar, but in text we use parentheses. However, the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Actually, in the problem statement: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\" — this refers to the standard subtractive principle for the existing symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). \n\n        There is no standard subtractive principle for numbers beyond M (1000). \n\n        However, sometimes, 4000 is written as MMMM, and 5000 as VMMMM, but that's not subtractive.\n\n        After research, one extended system is:\n\n          For numbers above 3999, we use bars or parentheses. But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem statement is unclear, I think the intended solution is to use the standard system for numbers up to 3999, and then for numbers above 3999, we can break it down as:\n\n          Write the thousands part by repeating M, and then the rest (less than 4000) by standard.\n\n        For example, 4000 = MMMM, 5000 = VMMMM, but wait, 5000 is actually V with a bar (meaning 5000) but we don't have bar, so we can write 5000 as MMMMM? No, that would be 5000.\n\n        Actually, 5000 = V with a bar, but in plain text we use parentheses: (V). Similarly, 10000 is (X).\n\n        However, the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"write it in base b\", and for Roman, base b is not defined. It's just the Roman numeral representation.\n\n        Since the problem is from an old time (260 AD) and the numbers in the example are small, and the constraint is 300010, but 300010 is 300000+10, and 300000 is 300 thousands, which we can write as CCCCCCCC... (300 Cs) but that is not practical.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n          Break the number into groups of thousands and the remainder.\n\n          Let n = 300010.\n\n          Let thousands_part = n // 1000   # 300\n          remainder = n % 1000              # 10\n\n          Then, we need to represent 300 in Roman? But 300 is CC? Actually, no: 300 is C for 100, so three Cs: CCC.\n\n          But wait, the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 100000. So we have to represent 300000 as 300 * 1000, and 1000 is M.\n\n          So 300000 is MMMMMMMMM... (300 M's). That is 300 characters, which is acceptable? The problem doesn't specify the length of the output.\n\n        However, the problem says the input string for base a has length at most 1000, but the output for base b (if Roman) might be long.\n\n        But the problem says the Roman number is at most 300010, so the thousands_part is at most 300, so the output for the thousands_part would be 300 M's. That's 300 characters, which is acceptable.\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Convert the base-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main parts: converting the input number from its given base to a base-10 integer, and then converting this base-10 integer to the desired target base (either another integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and the target base (b), which might be 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string from the source base to a base-10 integer. Each character in the string is processed to determine its value, considering both digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z) for bases higher than 10.\n3. **Target Base Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base-10 number to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding characters (digits 0-9 and letters A-Y for bases higher than 10).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base-10 number to Roman numerals using predefined values for thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones, applying subtractive notation where necessary (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). The Roman numeral conversion is limited to numbers up to 300010 as per the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n    except:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert the string from base `a` to base-10 integer\n    n = len(num_str)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    num_base10 = 0\n    valid_chars = set(\"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\")\n    for char in num_str:\n        if char not in valid_chars:\n            print(\"Invalid character in input string\")\n            return\n            \n    for char in num_str:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n        num_base10 = num_base10 * a + d\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4),\n            ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                count = n // value\n                if count:\n                    res += numeral * count\n                    n -= value * count\n            return res\n        \n        roman_num = to_roman(num_base10)\n        print(roman_num)\n        \n    else:\n        try:\n            b_int = int(b)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid target base\")\n            return\n            \n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n_val = num_base10\n        while n_val:\n            r = n_val % b_int\n            digits.append(r)\n            n_val //= b_int\n            \n        s_digits = []\n        for d in reversed(digits):\n            if d < 10:\n                s_digits.append(str(d))\n            else:\n                s_digits.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n                \n        print(''.join(s_digits))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input lines, parsing the source and target bases, and the number string.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is processed character by character. Each character's value is calculated based on its digit or letter representation, and the total value is accumulated into a base-10 integer.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: For Roman numerals, the base-10 number is converted by matching it against a list of Roman numeral values in descending order, appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For integer bases, the base-10 number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected and converted to their respective characters (digits or letters). The remainders are processed in reverse order to form the final result string.\n5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases like zero input, invalid characters, and invalid base conversions gracefully, providing appropriate error messages.",
