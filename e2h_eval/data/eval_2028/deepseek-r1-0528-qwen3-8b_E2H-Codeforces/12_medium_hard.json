The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (with clockwise order) and we start at house 1, we can move only clockwise.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house\", so we might stay in the same house for several consecutive tasks.\n\n The key is that after completing a task, we must be in the next task's house. But note: we must complete tasks in increasing order (i.e., task i must be done before task i+1, and the task i is at house ai). Also, we start at house 1.\n\n Since the ringroad is circular, from house k we can go to k+1 (if k < n) or to 1 (if k == n). The movement is clockwise.\n\n Important: We can think of the houses as arranged in a circle. We can also consider that the distance between two houses can be calculated in two ways? Actually, because it's a ring and we are only allowed to move clockwise, the movement from a house i to house j is:\n   If i <= j: then we can go from i to j by moving j - i steps.\n   If i > j: then we go from i to j by moving (n - i + j) steps.\n\n However, note: the entire movement must be clockwise. So if we are at house i and need to go to house j, then if i <= j, we just move j-i. Otherwise, we move from i to n (which is n-i steps) and then from 1 to j (which is j-1 steps) but wait: actually, since it's a ring, the total steps when i>j is (n - i + j). But note: the problem states the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives output 6.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Start at house 1.\n   First task at house 3: \n        From 1 to 3: since 1<=3, we move 3-1 = 2 steps. Now time=2, current house=3.\n   Second task at house 2:\n        From 3 to 2: since 3>2, we move (4-3+2)=3 steps. But wait, let me check: \n            Step-by-step: 3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (2nd step), 1->2 (3rd step). So 3 steps. Time becomes 2+3=5.\n   Third task at house 3:\n        From 2 to 3: 2<=3, so 3-2=1 step. Time becomes 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire journey is broken into segments:\n\n   We start at 1, then we do:\n      [1 -> 3] (distance 2)\n      [3 -> 2] (distance 3, because 3->4->1->2: 3 steps)\n      [2 -> 3] (distance 1)\n\n Total time: 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n But note: the problem condition says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" for the i-th task. This implies we must do the tasks in the given order.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n Let's break down the second example:\n\n   Start at 1.\n   First task at house 2: from 1 to 2: 1 step. Time=1.\n   Second task at house 3: from 2 to 3: 1 step. Time=2.\n   Third task at house 3: 0 steps. Time=2.\n\n Therefore, we have to consider the entire sequence.\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot simply calculate each segment independently because the entire journey is continuous.\n\n However, note that the problem requires to complete all tasks in increasing order (i.e., the tasks are given in an order, and we must do them in that order).\n\n We can simulate the journey by keeping track of the current position and the total time, but m and n can be up to 10^5, and we don't want to simulate each step (because worst-case we might have to move many steps and then the simulation would be O(n*m)).\n\n Instead, we can compute the distance from the current house to the next task house, then update the current house to the task house.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   For each task house in the list of m tasks:\n\n        if current <= task_house:\n            distance = task_house - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + task_house\n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = task_house\n\n But wait, let's test with the first example: [3,2,3]\n\n   current = 1\n   task_house = 3: 1<=3 -> distance=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n   task_house = 2: 3>2 -> distance=4-3+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n   task_house = 3: 2<=3 -> distance=1, total_time=6.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Second example: [2,3,3]\n\n   current=1\n   task_house=2: 1<=2 -> distance=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n   task_house=3: 2<=3 -> distance=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n   task_house=3: distance=0, total_time=2.\n\n   This also matches.\n\n However, note: the above simulation is O(m) and each step is O(1). Since m up to 10^5, this is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" for the i-th task. Does that mean we must do the tasks in the given order? Yes, the input order is the task order.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". This implies that the tasks are given in increasing index order (so the first task is the smallest index). But the problem does not say that the house numbers are sorted. The tasks are given in the order of increasing index, but the house numbers can be arbitrary.\n\n But our simulation above does exactly: we process the tasks in the given order.\n\n However, what if we have consecutive same houses? Then the distance is zero, which is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the next task is the same house? Then we don't move.\n\n However, there is a catch: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning that we must have completed the previous ones. But note, the example doesn't require us to return to the starting point or anything, just to do the tasks in the given order.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that we must end at the last task house. Our simulation naturally ends at the last task house.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to return to house 1. So we are done.\n\n But wait, is there any possibility that we can skip some tasks? No, because the condition is that we must complete tasks in increasing order (by their index) and we must be at the specified house for each task.\n\n However, let me read the problem again: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" This means that the i-th task depends on having completed the previous i-1 tasks. But the order of the tasks is fixed by the input (the first task is the one with the smallest index, etc.). \n\n But note: the input is given as \"a1, a2, ..., am\", so the first integer is the house for the first task, the second for the second task, etc.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to:\n\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of m integers.\n\n   Initialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\n   For each house in the list:\n        if current <= house:\n            steps = house - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + house\n        total_time += steps\n        current = house\n\n   Print(total_time)\n\n However, wait: the example input format is provided as two examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> expected output 6\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> expected output 2\n\n But note: the example input is given as two separate strings, but in reality we are reading from stdin.\n\n But wait: the problem says the ringroad is one way and clockwise. The above formula for the distance is correct for a clockwise ring.\n\n However, note: in the case where we are at house i and want to go to house j, and i>j, we are effectively going from i to n, then from 1 to j. But that is the only way because we can only move clockwise.\n\n But wait: is there a shorter way? In a ring, sometimes you can go the other way? However, the problem states the traffic is one way (clockwise). So we cannot go counter-clockwise.\n\n Therefore, the above calculation is correct.\n\n Let me test with a different example: n=5, tasks=[5,1,2]\n\n   Start at 1.\n   To 5: 1<=5 -> 4 steps, total_time=4, current=5.\n   From 5 to 1: 5>1 -> 5-5+1 = 1? But wait, that would be 1 step. However, in a ring of 5 houses, from 5 we can go to 1 in 1 step? Actually, yes: because 5->1 is one clockwise step (since after 5 comes 1). \n\n   Alternatively, we can compute: \n        When i>j: steps = n - current + house   -> 5-5+1 = 1.\n\n   Then from 1 to 2: 1<=2 -> 1 step. Total_time=4+1+1=6.\n\n   But let me break down:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Move 1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps (to get to 5). Now at 5.\n        Then from 5 to 1: one step (5->1). Then from 1 to 2: one step. \n        Total moves: 4 (to get to 5) + 1 (from 5 to 1) + 1 (from 1 to 2) = 6.\n\n   Alternatively, we can see that from 5 to 1 is indeed 1 step because the ring is circular.\n\n   The formula for the distance from i to j in a clockwise ring of n houses (only clockwise movement) is:\n\n        d(i, j) = (j - i) % n   but wait, modulo might give negative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if j >= i:\n            d = j - i\n        else:\n            d = n - i + j\n\n   This is the same as above.\n\n However, note: the modulus approach can be written as:\n\n        d = (j - i) % n   but if j-i is negative, then (j-i)%n would be n + (j-i) (if we use non-negative modulo). But note:\n\n        For j < i: (j-i) is negative, so (j-i) % n = j-i + n? Not exactly: in Python, for negative numbers, the modulo operation gives a result between 0 and n-1. But we want the positive steps.\n\n        Example: j=1, i=5, n=5: (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 in Python? Actually, no: (-4)%5 = 1? Let me check:\n\n            Actually, (-4) % 5 = 1, because -4 = -1*5 + 1.\n\n        But then the distance from 5 to 1 is 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the direct calculation by the formula (j - i) % n might not be the same as the absolute minimum steps in a two-way ring? But we are constrained to clockwise. \n\n        But note: in a clockwise ring, the distance from i to j is defined as the number of steps moving clockwise. And that is:\n\n            d = (j - i) % n   if we define the modulus to be positive? Actually, we can compute:\n\n            d = (j - i) % n   but then if (j-i) is negative, we add n until positive? Actually, we can do:\n\n            d = (j - i) % n\n            But wait, if j==i, then d=0.\n\n        However, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\n            Example: (1-5)%5 -> (-4)%5 -> 1, which is correct.\n\n            Example: (5-5)%5 -> 0, correct.\n\n            Example: (2-5)%5 -> (-3)%5 -> 2, which is the same as our formula: n - i + j = 5-5+2 = 2? Wait, no: wait, for i=5, j=2: \n                Using modulus: (2-5)%5 = -3 %5 = 2 (since -3 + 5 = 2).\n                Using our formula: n - i + j = 5-5+2 = 2.\n\n            Example: i=3, j=2: (2-3)%5 = -1 %5 = 4, and our formula: n-i+j = 5-3+2=4.\n\n        So the modulus formula gives the same result.\n\n        But note: the modulus formula is (j - i) % n, but wait: in modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) mod n, but if we are in a ring of n houses, then the distance from i to j is (j - i) mod n, but note that the modulus operation in Python for negative gives a positive number.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the modulus operation for positive numbers is straightforward. But note: if j>=i, then (j-i) % n = j-i (if j-i < n) and if j-i >= n, then we have to wrap around? Actually, no: because j is between 1 and n, and i is between 1 and n, so j-i is between -(n-1) and n-1.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to wrap around multiple times, and the modulus operation in Python will give the positive equivalent in the range [0, n-1]. However, if we have j-i positive and greater than or equal to n, then we have to subtract multiples of n? But j and i are between 1 and n, so j-i is at most n-1 (if j=n, i=1: n-1). Similarly, minimum is -(n-1). So the modulus operation will yield:\n\n            if j>=i: (j-i) % n = j-i (since j-i < n, because j<=n and i>=1, so j-i <= n-1, and positive)\n            if j<i: (j-i) % n = n + (j-i) (because j-i is negative)\n\n        But note: j-i is negative, so we add n until positive. And that is exactly our formula.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n            if steps < 0: steps += n   # but wait, the modulus already made it positive?\n\n        Actually, in Python, we don't need that because the modulus gives a non-negative result.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n            (house - current) % n is the same as (house - current + n) % n? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation in Python is defined to return a result in [0, n-1]. So if house-current is negative, then (house-current) % n = house-current + n * ceil(|house-current|/n) ? But wait, no: it returns the least non-negative residue.\n\n        But note: the distance we are calculating is the clockwise steps, and that is exactly the modulus value? \n\n        Example: from 5 to 1 in n=5: (1-5) %5 = (-4)%5 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        Example: from 5 to 2: (2-5)%5 = (-3)%5 = 2, which is correct.\n\n        Example: from 1 to 5: (5-1)%5 = 4, which is correct.\n\n        Example: from 3 to 3: (3-3)%5=0, correct.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n\n        But wait: is that always the case? What if house-current is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n\n        However, note: house and current are between 1 and n, so the difference is at most n-1 (if house=n, current=1: difference n-1) and at least -(n-1). So we never get a difference that is >= n or <= -n? \n\n        Because the maximum positive difference is n-1 (when house=n, current=1) and the minimum is -(n-1) (when house=1, current=n). \n\n        Therefore, (house - current) % n will give:\n\n            if house>=current: house-current (which is between 0 and n-1)\n            if house<current: house-current+n (which is between 1 and n-1, because house-current is between -(n-1) and -1, then adding n gives between 1 and n-1+ n? Actually, wait: \n\n            house-current+n = (house+n - current) -> and house+n-current: \n                minimum: when house=1, current=n: 1+n-n = 1, which is correct (as above, from n to 1 is 1 step? Actually, no: from n to 1 is 1 step, so the distance should be 1. But wait, our formula for house<current was: n - current + house, which for house=1, current=n: n-n+1=1, same.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation: (1-n)%n = (1-n+n) % n? Actually, (1-n)%n = (1)%n? No, wait: (1-n) is negative, so (1-n)%n = 1-n+n = 1? Actually, no: the modulus operation is defined as:\n\n            a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            For a = 1-n: floor((1-n)/n) = floor(- (n-1)/n ) = -1, because (n-1)/n is less than 1, so floor is -1.\n\n            Then (1-n) % n = (1-n) - n*(-1) = 1-n+n = 1.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        But wait, let me check with n=4, house=1, current=3: (1-3)%4 = (-2)%4 = 2, and our original formula: n - current + house = 4-3+1=2, same.\n\n        However, there's a nuance: the modulus operation gives the same result as our original formula.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not require an if-else. We can write:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n\n        But wait: is that the clockwise steps? Actually, in a ring, the clockwise steps from current to house is the smallest non-negative solution to (current + steps) % n = house % n? But note: we are numbering houses from 1 to n, and the modulus operation is defined for the set {0,1,...,n-1} if we consider 0-based. But we are using 1-based.\n\n        However, if we use modulus, we have to map the houses to 0-indexed? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n\n        But wait: if we do that, and then we have to consider that if the result is negative, we add n? Actually, no: the modulus operation in Python returns a non-negative value.\n\n        However, there's a problem: when house == current, then (house - current) % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for (house - current) % n gives the same as (house - current + n) % n? Actually, no: the modulus operation is defined differently. But we have seen that for negative values it adds n until positive.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the modulus operation for positive values that are greater than or equal to n? But note: the absolute difference between house and current is at most n-1, so we never have a positive difference >= n. Similarly, the negative difference is at least -(n-1). So the modulus operation will always yield a value between 0 and n-1.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n\n        But wait: let me test with a larger example: n=10, current=8, house=2.\n\n            (2-8) %10 = (-6)%10 = 4. \n            Original formula: n - current + house = 10-8+2=4.\n\n        It works.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\n            (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            For a=-6, n=10: floor(-6/10) = -1 (since -10 is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to -6? Actually, no: floor goes to the next lower integer. -6/10 is -0.6, floor(-0.6) is -1.\n\n            Then -6 - 10*(-1) = -6 +10 = 4.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But wait: what if we use the modulus operation and then add the steps? \n\n        However, there's a potential issue: the modulus operation in Python for a negative number a returns a result in [0, n-1] such that a % n = a - n * floor(a/n). \n\n        But note: the clockwise distance from current to house is defined as:\n\n            If house >= current: house - current\n            Else: n - current + house\n\n        And we have shown that (house - current) % n equals that.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n\n        However, wait: if house - current is negative, then (house - current) % n is positive and equals n + (house - current). But that is the same as the else part.\n\n        But note: in the modulus operation, the result is the same.\n\n        However, there's a caveat: what if house - current is exactly divisible by n? Then (house - current) % n == 0, which is correct.\n\n        Since house and current are in the range [1, n], the difference house - current is in [-n+1, n-1]. So we don't hit multiples of n (unless n=0, but n>=2). \n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus version.\n\n        But wait: what if n=10, current=1, house=10: (10-1)%10 = 9%10=9 -> correct (we move 9 steps).\n        What if current=10, house=1: (1-10)%10 = (-9)%10 = 1 -> correct (we move 1 step).\n\n        So it seems the modulus operation gives the correct clockwise steps.\n\n        However, let me verify the entire journey with modulus:\n\n            Example: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Start at current=1.\n\n            Task1: house=3 -> steps = (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> correct.\n            Then current=3.\n\n            Task2: house=2 -> steps = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n            Then current=2.\n\n            Task3: house=3 -> steps = (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            Total=2+3+1=6.\n\n        So we can use modulus.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation is faster than the if-else? Probably, but the if-else is also O(1). However, we can use:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n\n            if steps == 0 and house != current: \n                # Actually, wait: if house==current, then steps=0, which is correct. \n                # But if house != current, then steps==0 only if house==current? No, because if house != current, then (house - current) % n !=0? \n                # Actually, if house != current, then (house - current) % n is not zero? Because the difference is not a multiple of n. And the modulus operation in the range [0, n-1] will be zero only if the difference is a multiple of n, but the absolute difference is less than n, so only if the difference is 0.\n\n            So no, we don't need to adjust.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation returns 0 only when (house - current) is a multiple of n. Since |house - current| < n, the only multiple of n in that range is 0. So steps==0 iff house==current.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            steps = (house - current) % n   # This is the clockwise steps.\n\n        But wait: what if we use modulus, and the modulus operation is defined for negative? Then we are good.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined and gives the correct non-negative residue.\n\n        But let's check the performance: modulus is a constant-time operation.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for house in tasks:\n                steps = (house - current) % n\n                # But wait: the modulus operation above gives a result that is the same as the clockwise steps. However, note that when house < current, the modulus operation gives a positive value, which is the clockwise steps. But what if the modulus operation gives 0? Then house==current.\n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = house\n\n        However, wait: is that correct for the entire journey?\n\n        But wait: in the example n=4, tasks=[3,2,3] we got 6, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation for the first step: (3-1)%4=2, then current becomes 3. Then (2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3, then current becomes 2. Then (3-2)%4=1. Total=6.\n\n        Now, let me test with the example n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]: \n\n            Start current=1\n            house=2: (2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n            house=3: (3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            house=3: (3-3)%4=0 -> total_time=2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a task that is the same as the current? Then steps=0, which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation (house - current) % n is correct because:\n\n            The clockwise distance from current to house is defined as the smallest non-negative integer d such that (current + d) % n == house % n, but note: we are working in 1..n, and the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers is the standard modulus. However, we are not doing modulus for the positions, we are just using it for the difference.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation for the difference is independent of the actual positions. It is just the algebraic difference modulo n.\n\n        However, wait: the ring has n houses, so the distance from current to house is the smallest non-negative d such that (current + d) ≡ house (mod n). But note: the houses are labeled 1 to n, so we have to be cautious: if we are at current and we move d steps, then we land at (current + d) % n, but then we have to map back to 1..n? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation in the problem is defined for the ring of n houses. The movement is linear: we move from current to current+1, then current+2, ... until we wrap.\n\n        The modulus operation for the difference is the same as the distance.\n\n        However, there is a known way to compute the clockwise distance in a ring of n nodes (with node labels 1..n) is:\n\n            d = (house - current) % n\n            if d == 0 and house != current: \n                d = n   # but wait, if house==current, then d=0, otherwise d is the modulus. But wait, if house==current, then d=0, which is correct. But if house != current, then d is in [1, n-1] because the modulus operation for non-zero differences (with absolute value less than n) gives a value in [0, n-1] excluding 0 only when house != current? Actually, no: if house != current, then the modulus might be 0 only if the difference is a multiple of n, but the absolute difference is less than n, so it cannot be a non-zero multiple. Therefore, if house != current, then (house - current) % n is not 0.\n\n        So we don't need the if.\n\n        But wait: what if n=5, current=5, house=5: (5-5)%5=0, correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code can be:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for house in tasks:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to house\n                steps = (house - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if (house - current) is negative? The modulus operation handles that.\n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = house\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: let me test with a case where house - current is negative and the modulus gives the correct positive value.\n\n        Example: n=10, current=8, house=2: (2-8)%10 = -6 %10 = 4, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: is there any case where (house - current) % n is not the clockwise steps? \n\n        Consider: n=10, current=1, house=10: (10-1)%10=9, which is correct (we move 9 steps: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10).\n\n        Now, consider: n=10, current=10, house=1: (1-10)%10 = (-9)%10=1, which is correct (10->1: 1 step).\n\n        Another: n=10, current=5, house=5: 0, correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have to move from house 10 to house 9? \n\n            (9-10)%10 = (-1)%10=9, which is correct: 10->1->2->...->9: 9 steps.\n\n        However, wait: the example above for n=10, current=8, house=2: 4 steps, but the step-by-step:\n\n            Start at 8.\n            Step1: 9\n            Step2: 10\n            Step3: 1\n            Step4: 2\n\n            That's 4 steps.\n\n        So the modulus method is correct.\n\n        But wait: why is the modulus operation giving the clockwise steps? \n\n        Explanation: \n\n            In a ring of n houses, the clockwise distance from current to house is the smallest non-negative d such that:\n\n                (current + d) mod n = house mod n   [but note: we are using the natural labeling from 1 to n, and modulus in mathematics is defined for residues modulo n, but our houses are 1-indexed.]\n\n            However, we can map the houses to 0-indexed: let current0 = current-1, house0 = house-1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance in 0-indexed is (house0 - current0) % n.\n\n            Then convert back: but wait, the modulus operation in the 0-indexed system is the same as the 1-indexed? \n\n            Actually, the problem is that the modulus operation we did was in the 1-indexed system. \n\n            But note: the modulus operation (house - current) % n is valid because the ring has n houses, and the labels are 1..n. The movement from current to house is the same as in the 0-indexed system if we consider:\n\n                In 0-indexed: current0 = current-1, house0 = house-1.\n\n                Then the clockwise distance in 0-indexed is (house0 - current0) % n, but note: in a circular array of n elements, the clockwise distance from current0 to house0 is (house0 - current0) % n, but if negative, we add n.\n\n            However, (house0 - current0) % n = ((house-1) - (current-1)) % n = (house - current) % n.\n\n            So the modulus operation is the same.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for house in tasks:\n                steps = (house - current) % n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = house\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: I just realized that the modulus operation in the 0-indexed system is defined for an array of n elements, but note: the modulus operation for the 0-indexed system is over the set {0,1,...,n-1}. The distance from current0 to house0 is (house0 - current0) % n, but if that is negative, we add n. And that is the same as (house0 - current0 + n) % n? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation in Python does the same.\n\n        But wait: let me test with 0-indexed: \n\n            n=4, current=1 (0-indexed:0), house=3 (0-indexed:2): (2-0)%4=2, correct.\n\n            current=3 (0-indexed:2), house=2 (0-indexed:1): (1-2)%4= -1%4=3, correct.\n\n        So it is consistent.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in the 1-indexed system is the same as in the 0-indexed system for the difference, because we are subtracting the same offset (1) from both.\n\n        Therefore, we can stick to the 1-indexed modulus.\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus operation returns 0 for a non-zero difference? We have established that if the difference is non-zero and less than n in absolute value, then modulus returns a non-zero value unless the difference is 0.\n\n        However, wait: what if the difference is n? Then (house - current) % n = 0, but if house - current = n, then house = current + n. But house is at most n, and current is at least 1, so house - current <= n-1. Similarly, the minimum is -(n-1). So we never have a difference of n or -n.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation is safe.\n\n        But wait: the problem constraints say n>=2 and m>=1, and the house numbers are between 1 and n.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for x in a:\n                # Compute the clockwise steps from current to x\n                diff = x - current\n                if diff < 0:\n                    diff += n   # This is the same as (x - current) % n, but we can use modulus directly.\n                else:\n                    # diff is positive, but we don't need to adjust because modulus for positive is the same?\n                    # Actually, modulus for positive is the same as the positive value if it's less than n.\n                    # But wait: if diff >= n? Then we would have to reduce by n, but as argued, diff is at most n-1, so no.\n                    pass\n                # Alternatively, we can use the modulus operator.\n\n            But wait, we can simply do:\n\n                steps = (x - current) % n\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation in Python for a positive number that is less than n is the same as the number, so we don't need to adjust.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation for a positive number that is >=n? Then we take modulo. But our diff is at most n-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road with houses numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. For each task, she needs to be at the specified house. The key observation is that the ring road allows movement only in the clockwise direction, so the distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions.\n2. **Insight**: The distance from the current house to the next task house can be computed using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the clockwise distance from house `i` to house `j` is `(j - i) % n`. This formula accounts for both cases where `j` is greater than or less than `i` by wrapping around the ring if necessary.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using the modulo operation, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the task's house. This approach efficiently handles each task in constant time, making the solution optimal for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for house in tasks:\n        steps = (house - current) % n\n        total_time += steps\n        current = house\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) with zero initial time (`total_time = 0`).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: The clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house is calculated using `(house - current) % n`. This handles both direct paths (when `house >= current`) and wrapped paths (when `house < current`).\n   - **Time Accumulation**: The computed distance is added to the total time.\n   - **Update Position**: The current position is updated to the task's house.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time taken is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
