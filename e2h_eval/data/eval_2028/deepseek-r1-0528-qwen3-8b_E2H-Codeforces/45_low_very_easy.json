There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) between 2 and 10^18.\n We are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the only one who doesn't lose until the final. But the problem has an additional constraint on the grid: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n How to think?\n Let's denote that the winner must win k games. Then, the tournament structure must be such that the winner can play k consecutive games, and the rule about the number of games played must hold.\n\n We can model the tournament as a binary tree? Actually, the constraint is similar to a condition in a heap or a balanced tournament bracket. However, note that the example:\n\n   n=2 -> 1 game\n   n=3 -> 2 games (player1 beats two others)\n   n=4 -> 2 games\n\n Another example: n=10 -> 4 games.\n\n What is the pattern?\n\n Consider the following: the winner must win k games. The tournament has k rounds (if it were a full single elimination, the winner would play k games in k consecutive rounds). However, the constraint says that when the winner plays his next game, the opponent must have a number of games played that is either the same or differs by one.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let a_i be the number of games the winner has played after i wins (so after 0 wins, 0; after 1 win, 1; etc.)\n   And the opponent for the i-th game must have played either a_{i-1} (same as the winner just before the i-th game) or a_{i-1} ± 1.\n\n But note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner can play k games.\n\n Alternatively, we can think in terms of how many players are needed to set up a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n We can build the tournament in rounds. However, note that the problem does not require the entire tournament to be balanced. But the condition forces a kind of balance.\n\n Insight:\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, we can consider the structure as follows:\n\n   Round 0: 1 player (the winner) and some other players.\n   But wait, we need to set up the bracket so that the winner plays one game at a time, and the opponents are chosen from the rest.\n\n However, note the constraint: the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less (or one more? actually, the problem says \"differs by no more than one\"). But since the winner is playing for the first time and then increasing, the opponent must have either the same or one less? Actually, the rule is about the number of games each has already played. So when the winner (who has played 0) is to play, he can only play against someone with 0 or 1 game? But initially, everyone has 0. Then after the first game, the winner has 1 and the loser leaves. Now the winner has 1, so the next game requires an opponent with 0, 1, or 2? But note: we don't have any player with 2 yet.\n\n Actually, the condition is symmetric: two players can play if their current number of games differ by at most one.\n\n So the winner's path:\n\n   Game 1: winner (0 games) vs. opponent (0 or 1) -> but initially, the opponent must have 0 (since no one else has played). Then the winner becomes 1.\n\n   Game 2: now the winner has 1 game. He must play against someone with 0,1, or 2 games. But we have:\n        - The winner: 1 game\n        - The other players: still 0 games (if they haven't played) and possibly one other player has 1 game? (if they played a game and won)\n\n   However, the entire tournament must be set up optimally to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n Alternate approach: let f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\n How do we arrange the tournament?\n\n We can use a recursive (or iterative) way:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, we need:\n\n     - The winner must win k games.\n\n     - The k opponents in the winner's path must be arranged in such a way that they are available (and have the correct number of games) at the time.\n\n   However, note: the tournament is set up arbitrarily (we can choose the order). We want the maximum k such that the tournament with n players can have the winner play k games.\n\n   We can think of the tournament as having two parts",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their number of previous games is at most one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the winner must win all their games to continue.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the winner's path through the tournament must be structured such that each opponent they face has either the same number of previous games or one less (or more). This constraint limits the maximum number of games the winner can play. \n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that the total number of players required to allow the winner to play `k` games does not exceed `n`. The number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games can be derived by considering the structure of the tournament rounds. Specifically, the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the formula `2^k - 1`, but this is adjusted based on whether the number of players is sufficient to form balanced brackets.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iteratively checking for the maximum `k` where the sum of players in each round (modeled as a binary tree) does not exceed `n`. The rounds are structured such that the winner faces opponents who have either the same number of previous games or one less. The total players required for `k` games is calculated by summing the players from each level of the tournament bracket.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraints (n can be as large as 10^18), the algorithm efficiently checks possible values of `k` using a loop that runs in logarithmic time relative to `n`, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    k = 0\n    total_players_used = 0\n    \n    while True:\n        k += 1\n        current_round_players = 1 << (k - 1)\n        total_players_used += current_round_players\n        \n        if total_players_used > n:\n            break\n            \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input value `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Loop to Determine Maximum Games**: The loop increments `k` (the number of games) and calculates the number of players required for the current round (`current_round_players`). This is done using bit shifting (1 << (k-1)) which efficiently computes powers of two.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop breaks when the cumulative number of players used (`total_players_used`) exceeds `n`.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is `k - 1`, as the loop exits one iteration too early, so we subtract one to get the correct maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum games by leveraging the properties of binary trees and bit manipulation, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
