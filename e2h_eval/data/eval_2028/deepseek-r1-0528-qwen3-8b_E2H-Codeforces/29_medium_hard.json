Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with up to 10^5 queries and the initial string of length up to 10^5, and the total length of replacement strings is up to 10^5.\n\n The challenge: We cannot do naive string replacements (like replacing every occurrence of a digit by a string) because the string might become very long (exponentially if we do multiple replacements). Also, we have to compute the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n Important: The problem says that after all the queries, we form a string s (which might have leading zeros) and then interpret that string as a decimal number (ignoring leading zeros, but note: if the string is empty, the number is zero).\n\n However, note that the replacements are done in sequence. But if we do the replacements naively, the string can blow up.\n\n Observation: The problem says the total length of all ti for queries is <= 10^5. This suggests that we can use dynamic programming or processing the queries backwards?\n\n Another idea: Instead of building the entire string (which might be too big), we can process the string from right to left and use the fact that each query is independent and the order of digits matters.\n\n However, note: the queries are sequential and each query replaces a specific digit (say '2') by a string (say \"00\"). Then the next query might refer to digits that appear in the replacement? Actually, no: the queries are given as \"di -> ti\", and di is a single digit. But note: the replacement ti can contain digits that will be subject to subsequent queries? \n\n Let me clarify: The problem says \"Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries ... For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and then if there's a next query \"3→\" it transforms it to 1212.\".\n\n But wait: the example doesn't show overlapping queries. However, the problem does not say that the same digit cannot be replaced again by a later query. Actually, the queries are performed in the given order, and each query replaces every occurrence of the digit (at that moment) with the string ti.\n\n However, note: the replacement happens for the current state of the string. So if we have two consecutive queries:\n\n   Query1: '2' -> '00'\n   Query2: '3' -> ''\n\n Then in the first query, we replace all '2's by '00', so the string becomes 10031003 (if original was 123123). Then the second query replaces all '3's by '' (remove them). So we remove the two '3's and get 100100.\n\n But wait, the example output for the second sample is '1212'. Why? Because the example input was:\n\n   Input: ['123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\n Actually, the second sample input is:\n\n   \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n So only one query: replace '3' by empty string. Then the string becomes 1212.\n\n However, the third sample:\n\n   Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n\n   Step1: replace all '2' by '0': becomes \"000\"\n   Step2: replace all '0' by '7': becomes \"777\"\n\n But note: the problem says the queries are performed in the given order.\n\n However, if we do the replacements naively, the string might become too long. The total length of the string after all replacements could be enormous (like exponential growth). Therefore, we must avoid building the entire string.\n\n Alternative approach: We can process the queries backwards and build a transformation for each digit. Why backwards?\n\n Idea: Consider that each query is a transformation rule. The last query is the one that is applied last. But note: the rules might interact: a digit in the replacement string of an earlier query might be transformed by a later query.\n\n However, if we process from the last query to the first, we can define for each digit what is the final string it becomes.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Let f(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after all queries.\n\n  But note: the queries are applied in order. The first query is applied first, then the second, etc.\n\n  How about: We start from the last query and go backwards, updating the transformation for each digit.\n\n  Initially, without any queries, each digit d maps to itself.\n\n  Then, when we process a query \"d -> t\", we know that at the time of this query, the digit d becomes t. But then, after this query, the string is transformed, and then we apply subsequent queries. So the digit d will be replaced by t, and then every digit in t will be further transformed by the subsequent queries.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      Let F be a mapping from each digit to a string (initially, F[d] = d for each digit d, and also we can consider non-digit characters? but our string only has digits).\n\n      Then, we process the queries from last to first.\n\n      For a query \"d -> t\", the current F[d] should be set to the result of applying the subsequent queries (i.e., the F mapping at the time of this query) to the string t.\n\n      But note: the subsequent queries (the ones we've already processed, which are the ones after the current one) are stored in F. So we can compute:\n\n          F[d] = transform(t, F)\n\n      where transform(s, F) means: for each character c in s, we take F[c] (but note: F[c] is a string) and concatenate them.\n\n      However, we cannot do this naively for each query because the string t might be long and the total length of all t is 10^5, but the total transformation might be done many times (for each query we process, we might have to transform the entire t using F). But note: the total length of all t is 10^5, and the total length of the transformed strings might be huge.\n\n  Alternatively, we can store for each digit a pair (value, length) representing the number and the length of the string that the digit would produce, but we cannot store the entire string because it might be too long.\n\n  But note: we are only interested in the final number modulo 10^9+7. The final number is built by the entire string (from left to right). We can use dynamic programming to compute the value and the length (in terms of power of 10) for each digit.\n\n  Let's define:\n\n      dp[d] = (val, len)\n          val: the numeric value of the string that the digit d becomes, modulo 1000000007.\n          len: the length of the string (number of digits) that the digit d becomes.\n\n  However, the problem: the transformations are sequential and we are going to update the dp for digits as we process the queries.\n\n  Steps for backward processing:\n\n      We start with base state for each digit d: \n          dp[d] = (int(d), 1)\n\n      Then, we process queries from the last one to the first one.\n\n      For a query (d, t): \n          We want to set dp[d] to the result of replacing each character c in t by dp[c] (which we have computed from the subsequent queries).\n\n          Then, the new value for dp[d] is the concatenation of the values from each c in t.\n\n          How to compute the value for a string t?\n\n          Suppose we have a list of (val, len) for each character c in t.\n\n          Then, the entire value for t is: \n              value = 0\n              power = 1\n              But we have to account for the fact that the digits are in base-10 and the positions matter.\n\n          Actually, if we have a string built from parts, the entire number is:\n\n            Let the parts be [part1, part2, ..., partk] (each part is the string for a digit, and they are concatenated).\n\n            Then, the total value = (part1_value * (10^(L2 + ... + Lk)) + (part2_value * (10^(L3 + ... + Lk)) + ... + partk_value\n\n          And the total length is L1 + L2 + ... + Lk.\n\n          We can compute:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            total_length = 0\n            current_power = 1   # but we need to accumulate the exponents\n\n          Alternatively, we can traverse the string t from right to left, and for each character c:\n\n            Let (v, l) = dp[c]\n            Then, the current part is v, and the multiplier for this part is 10^(total_length_so_far) (because the part will be placed at the higher digits).\n\n          But we don't know the total_length_so_far until we process all.\n\n          However, we can precompute the total length of the entire string t after transformation, and then use modular arithmetic for the value.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let L = 0   (total length so far)\n            Let V = 0   (total value so far)\n\n            Then, for each c in t:\n                (v, l) = dp[c]\n                V = (V * pow(10, l, mod)) % mod   -> but wait, that doesn't work because the current part is v, and we need to shift the current value by the length of the following parts? Actually, we are going from left to right, but the transformation is that the leftmost part is the most significant.\n\n          Alternatively, we can process from right to left:\n\n            Let L_total = 0\n            Let V_total = 0\n\n            For i from last character to first character in t:\n                (v, l) = dp[c_i]\n                V_total = (v * pow(10, L_total, mod) + V_total) % mod\n                L_total = (L_total + l) % (mod-1)   ??? Wait, but modulus for exponent? \n\n          However, note: the modulus is 1000000007 for the value, but the length is just the count of digits (which is an integer). The length can be huge, but we are only interested in the value modulo 1000000007.\n\n          But the length is needed to compute the power of 10 for shifting. However, the length can be up to (10^5) initially, and then each query might multiply the length by the length of the replacement. The total length might be astronomical. But note: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti is 10^5, and we are processing from the last query backwards, and we are storing for each digit the value and the length (the number of digits) modulo something?\n\n          Actually, we cannot store the entire length as an integer because the length might be too big (exponential). But we are only interested in the value modulo 1000000007.\n\n          However, the shifting: we need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007 for the length L. But L can be very large (like 10^100000). We cannot compute that directly.\n\n          Alternative: we note that the value of the entire string is computed by:\n\n            Let the entire string be S = s0 s1 ... s_{k-1}\n\n            Then value(S) = s0 * 10^(k-1) + s1 * 10^(k-2) + ... + s_{k-1}\n\n          But we break S into parts. Each part is the expansion of a digit. The expansion of a digit d is a string T_d, and then the entire string is the concatenation of T_{c0} T_{c1} ... T_{c_{m-1}}.\n\n          Then, the value is:\n\n            value = 0\n            for i in range(len(S)):\n                digit = the digit at position i (but note: the string is broken into segments, so we cannot look at the original digits)\n\n          However, we can use the dp for each digit and then combine the segments.\n\n          Let F(d) = (v, l) for digit d.\n\n          Then, for a string t, the transformation is:\n\n            Let t = t0 t1 ... t_{k-1}\n\n            Then the value for t is:\n\n                V = 0\n                L = 0\n                for i from 0 to k-1:\n                    (v_i, l_i) = F(t_i)\n                    V = (V * (10 ** l_i)) % mod   -> but wait, this is not correct because we are shifting the entire current value by the length of the next segment? Actually, no: we are reading from left to right, so the first segment is the most significant.\n\n          Actually, we should do:\n\n            Let the entire string be broken into segments. The first segment is the expansion of t0, then t1, etc.\n\n            Then, the value is:\n\n                value = 0\n                for each segment (v_i, l_i):\n                    value = (value * (10 ** l_i) + v_i) % mod\n\n          But the problem: 10 ** l_i mod 1000000007, and l_i might be huge. But note: we are storing l_i as the length of the segment (an integer). However, the length of the entire string might be too big to represent as an integer (exponential growth). But the problem constraints say the total length of all ti is 10^5, but the total length of the resulting string might be huge.\n\n          However, we don't need the exact length, we only need the value modulo 1000000007. But the length is used to compute the power of 10. And the exponent (l_i) can be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot compute 10^(l_i) mod 1000000007 directly by exponentiation if l_i is that big? Actually, we can use Euler's theorem.\n\n          But note: we are storing the length for each digit, and then combining. However, the length of the entire string (even if we store it as an integer) might exceed the limits of Python integers? Probably not, because the total length of all ti is 10^5, and we are processing queries backwards and the total length of the string might be bounded by the product of the lengths of the replacements? But the problem says the total length of all ti is 10^5, but the same digit might be replaced multiple times and the length might grow exponentially.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the input constraint, but the intermediate results might be huge. But we are not storing the entire string, only the value and the length for each digit.\n\n          But we must store the length for each digit because we need to know how much to shift the value. However, the length might become very large (exponential) and we cannot store it as an integer (it would have millions of digits). \n\n  Alternative Insight: We don't actually need the exact length if we can compute the power of 10 modulo 1000000007 without knowing the length? But wait, the length is the exponent. We need 10^(length) mod 1000000007. However, the modulus for exponents is phi(1000000007) = 1000000006, because 1000000007 is prime.\n\n          But note: the length is the number of digits, and we are only interested in the value of the entire expression mod 1000000007.\n\n          We can store for each digit d: (value, length) where length is stored modulo (1000000006) for the purpose of exponentiation? Because by Fermat's little theorem, 10^k mod 1000000007 = 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that k >= 0 and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime (which they are). However, note: if k is the length, then the exponent is k, and we can reduce k modulo 1000000006.\n\n          BUT: This is only valid for exponents in modular exponentiation when the base and modulus are coprime. However, here the base is 10 and modulus is 1000000007 (prime) so yes, and Euler's theorem applies: 10^phi(mod) ≡ 1 mod mod.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the length is the number of digits, and we are shifting the current value by (length) digits. The shifting operation is: \n\n            value = (current_value * (10 ** length) + next_value) % mod\n\n          But if the length is huge, we can compute 10**length mod mod by reducing the exponent modulo 1000000006 (the totient) and then use pow(base, exponent, mod).\n\n          BUT: the length itself is the exponent, and we are storing the length as an integer. However, the length might be astronomically huge (with thousands of digits) and we cannot store it as an integer. Therefore, we must store the length modulo 1000000006, but wait: is that safe?\n\n          Example: We have two lengths: L1 and L2, and we want to compute 10^(L1+L2) mod mod. We can compute 10^(L1) mod mod and 10^(L2) mod mod and then combine? But note: 10^(a+b) = 10^a * 10^b mod mod. However, we are storing the exponents (lengths) modulo 1000000006 (the totient) for the purpose of exponentiation. But note: the exponentiation identity requires that the exponent is taken modulo the totient (only for base and modulus coprime). \n\n          However, the length is being used in two ways: \n            (1) To compute the power of 10 for shifting: we need 10^(length) mod 1000000007.\n            (2) To compute the total length of the string (for the next combining step). But the total length is just the sum of the lengths of the segments.\n\n          But wait, the problem: the length is the number of digits, and we are going to use it as an exponent. However, the shifting formula requires the actual exponent (the length) to compute the power. But if we store the length modulo 1000000006, then for the exponentiation we can use the reduced exponent. However, for the next combining step (when we combine two segments) we need to add the lengths. But the length is not modulo 1000000007, it's just a natural number (and we are adding them). The problem is that the length might be too big to store.\n\n          We can store two things for each digit:\n\n            value: the value of the expanded digit, modulo 1000000007.\n            length: the length of the expanded digit (as an integer, but we hope that the total length doesn't exceed the limit? Or we can store the length modulo 1000000006 for the exponentiation, but we need the real length for combining the exponents? Actually, no: when combining two segments, we do:\n\n            total_value = (left_value * (10 ** right_length) + right_value) % mod\n\n            But we need the right_length to compute the exponent. However, the right_length might be huge, but we can compute 10^(right_length) mod 1000000007 by:\n\n                power = pow(10, right_length_mod, 1000000007)\n\n            where right_length_mod = right_length % 1000000006, but only if we are sure that the exponentiation can be reduced by the totient.\n\n          However, note: the length is the actual number of digits, and we are shifting the left_value by the entire length of the right part. The shifting operation is defined by the base-10 representation: each digit in the right part occupies a certain number of digits (the length of the right part). The shifting multiplies the left_value by 10^(length_of_right_part). \n\n          But the length_of_right_part is stored as an integer. The problem: the length_of_right_part might be huge (exponential growth) and we cannot store it as an integer.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid storing the length as an integer. Instead, we can store the length modulo 1000000006 (for exponentiation) and separately store the actual length as a string? No, that doesn't help.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store the length as a tuple (low, high) in base 1000000006? But that is complicated.\n\n  Let me reframe: We are only interested in the value of the entire expression. We can compute the value without knowing the exact length? Actually, no, because the shifting depends on the length.\n\n  But note: the shifting is done by multiplying by 10^(length) and then adding the value of the next part. We can use the method of storing the value and the length (the length as an integer) but the length might be too big to represent. However, the problem says the initial string is up to 10^5 and the total length of all ti is 10^5, but the transformations are applied sequentially and the length might be huge (like 10^(number_of_queries) in the worst case). \n\n  But note: the constraints say the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is 10^5. However, the same digit might be replaced multiple times and the length can grow multiplicatively.\n\n  Example: \n      Start with \"1\"\n      Query1: \"1\" -> \"11\"   (so length becomes 2)\n      Query2: \"1\" -> \"11\"   (then the string becomes \"1111\", length 4)\n      Query3: \"1\" -> \"11\"   (then becomes \"11111111\", length 8)\n\n  After n queries, the length is 2^n. With n up to 10^5, 2^(100000) is astronomical.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot store the length as an integer.\n\n  We must find a way to compute the value without storing the entire length.\n\n  Alternative approach: use a system that stores the value and the length (in log form) but that doesn't help for the modulus.\n\n  Another idea: we process the entire string with a DP that goes from left to right, but we use the transformation rules (which we have built by processing queries backwards) to expand each digit. However, the expansion is defined by the transformation for that digit, and we have precomputed for each digit d: (value, length) but we cannot store the length as an integer.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the transformation rules to compute the entire string without building it, by processing the original string and expanding each digit, but we need to know the effect of the entire transformation on a digit.\n\n  However, we can use the backward processing to update the transformation for each digit, and then use a recursive (or iterative) function that expands a digit by its transformation, but without storing the entire string.\n\n  But note: the problem asks for the final number modulo 1000000007.\n\n  We can use a state machine that for each digit stores two things:\n\n      val[d]: the value of the expansion of d (mod 1000000007)\n      len_mod[d]: the length of the expansion of d (mod 1000000006)   [for exponentiation]\n\n  Then, when combining two expansions (for a string t):\n\n      Let the entire string t be expanded. Then, the value is computed by:\n\n          total_value = 0\n          total_length_mod = 0   (this is the total length mod 1000000006, but wait: the length is used as exponent, so we need the exponent mod 1000000006)\n\n      However, we cannot simply add the lengths modulo 1000000006 because the shifting requires the actual length (to know the exponent) and the exponentiation uses the exponent modulo 1000000006. But note: the shifting operation is defined by the entire length (the number of digits). But the length is additive. \n\n      Actually, the entire length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each character in t. And the value is:\n\n          value = 0\n          for each char c in t:\n              (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])   [BUT: wait, we are storing the length modulo 1000000006, but the actual length is used in the exponentiation. However, for the exponentiation we can use the reduced exponent (mod 1000000006) because of Euler's theorem. And for the next combining step, we need the total length (the exponent for the next shift) which is the sum of the individual lengths. But we cannot store the total length as an integer because it is too big.\n\n      However, we are only interested in the exponentiation for the base 10. And the shifting factor is 10^(L), and we can compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007 by:\n\n          power = pow(10, L, 1000000007)\n\n      But L is the total length, and we can compute L mod 1000000006 (since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, and 1000000006 is the totient). Then:\n\n          power = pow(10, L % 1000000006, 1000000007)\n\n      But note: Euler's theorem requires that the exponent is reduced modulo phi(mod) and that the base and modulus are coprime. This holds.\n\n      However, the entire value computation for the string t is:\n\n          total_value = 0\n          current_exponent = 0   # but we are going to process the string from left to right, and we want to shift the current total_value by the length of the next part.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          total_value = 0\n          for c in t:\n              (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n              # The current total_value is the value for the part before c. We need to shift it by the length of the expansion of c? \n              # Actually, no: we are processing from left to right. The expansion of c will be appended at the end.\n\n          But wait, the expansion of c is the least significant part. In the entire number, the expansion of c is the last part.\n\n          Therefore, we should process the string t from right to left.\n\n          total_value = 0\n          total_length = 0   # but we cannot store total_length as integer, so we store total_length_mod (for exponentiation) and separately we need to know the total_length for the next shift? Actually, no: the shifting factor for the next part (if we were to add a part to the left) is 10^(total_length). But we are processing from right to left.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Let the string t be processed from left to right, but then we need to know the length of the entire remaining part (to the right) to shift the current value by the length of the remaining part. But that is not known until we process the entire string.\n\n          Better: Process from right to left.\n\n          total_value = 0\n          total_length_mod = 0   # This is the total length of the parts we have processed (from right to left) modulo 1000000006.\n\n          Then, for c in reversed(t):\n              (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n              # The current part has value v, and we need to shift the existing total_value by the length of the current part? Actually, no: we are going from right to left, so the current part is the most significant so far.\n\n          Actually, we want to combine the parts from right to left:\n\n          Example: t = \"ab\", then the expansion of a and b: \n            First, we process b: the value is v_b, length l_b.\n            Then, we process a: the value is v_a, length l_a.\n\n            The entire value is: v_a * (10 ** l_b) + v_b.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            # Start from the last character (rightmost) and move left.\n            for c in reversed(t):\n                (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n                # Shift the current total_value by l (multiply by 10^l) and then add v.\n                total_value = (total_value * pow(10, l, 1000000007) + v) % 1000000007\n\n          But wait, we are using the length l (stored modulo 1000000006) for the exponentiation. Is that valid?\n\n          Yes, because of Euler's theorem: 10^l mod 1000000007 = 10^(l mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007.\n\n          However, we must ensure that we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 for each digit.\n\n          Now, how do we update the transformation for a query \"d -> t\"?\n\n          We have a query (d, t). Then, we want to set:\n\n            val[d] = the value computed by expanding t (using the current val and len_mod for all digits) \n            len_mod[d] = the total length of t (which is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each character in t) modulo 1000000006.\n\n          But note: the length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each character in t. And we are storing the length for each digit (len_mod) modulo 1000000006. However, the length is additive, so:\n\n            len_mod[d] = (sum of len_mod[c] for c in t) % 1000000006\n\n          But is that correct? \n\n          Example: \n            t = \"12\", and we have:\n                val['1'] = 1, len_mod['1'] = 1\n                val['2'] = 2, len_mod['2'] = 1\n\n            Then the total length for t should be 2.\n\n            But if we do (len_mod['1'] + len_mod['2']) % 1000000006 = (1+1) % 1000000006 = 2, which is correct.\n\n          However, the value for t is:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            for c in reversed(t):  # so first '2', then '1'\n                c='2': (v=2, l=1) -> total_value = (0 * (10^1) + 2) = 2\n                c='1': (v=1, l=1) -> total_value = (2 * (10^1) + 1) = 21\n\n          But wait, the expansion of t=\"12\" is the expansion of '1' and then '2', so the entire string is the expansion of '1' followed by the expansion of '2'. That is: [expansion of '1'] [expansion of '2'].\n\n          In base-10, the expansion of '1' is \"1\", and expansion of '2' is \"2\", so the entire string is \"12\", which is 12, not 21.\n\n          We did the reversal, so we processed from right to left. But the expansion of the left part is the most significant. \n\n          Actually, the entire string is built by the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in t in the given order.\n\n          In the example, t=\"12\": the expansion is the expansion of '1' (which is \"1\") and then expansion of '2' (which is \"2\"), so the entire string is \"12\", which is 12.\n\n          But our calculation for the value was:\n\n            Start with the last character (which is '2') and then the first character ('1').\n\n            We did:\n\n                First, process '2': total_value = 2, then process '1': total_value = (2 * 10^1 + 1) = 21.\n\n          Why is that? Because we are processing from right to left and the expansion of the left character is the most significant. But the expansion of the left character comes first. \n\n          Actually, the entire string is built by:\n\n            s = expand(t[0]) + expand(t[1]) + ... + expand(t[k-1])\n\n          So the first expansion (t[0]) is the most significant. \n\n          Our method for the value computation was:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            for c in reversed(t):\n                (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n                total_value = (total_value * (10^l) + v) % mod\n\n          This method is for processing a string from least significant to most significant. But our string t is given from left to right (most significant to least significant). \n\n          We want to compute the value of the entire string (concatenation) from left to right. \n\n          Let the entire string be S = s0 s1 ... s_{k-1}. Then the value is:\n\n            V = s0 * 10^(L1+...+L_{k-1}) + s1 * 10^(L2+...+L_{k-1}) + ... + s_{k-1}\n\n          We can compute this by:\n\n            V = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                (v_i, l_i) = expand(t[i])\n                V = V * (10 ** l_i) + v_i\n\n          But then we are shifting the current value by the length of the next part. \n\n          This is equivalent to:\n\n            V = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                (v_i, l_i) = expand(t[i])\n                V = (V * (10 ** l_i) + v_i) % mod\n\n          Now, the exponentiation base 10 with exponent l_i (the length of the expansion of t[i]) is done modulo 1000000007, and we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n          So the procedure for a query \"d -> t\" is:\n\n            Let new_val = 0\n            Let new_len = 0   (we'll compute modulo 1000000006)\n\n            For each character c in t (from left to right):\n                (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, l, 1000000007) + v) % 1000000007\n                new_len = (new_len + l) % 1000000006\n\n            Then set:\n                val[d] = new_val\n                len_mod[d] = new_len\n\n          Then, we process the next query (previous one in the original order) and update accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the base state for a digit d is (val[d] = int(d), len_mod[d] = 1). \n\n          But wait, the base state: initially, there are no queries, so the string is the input s. But then we are going to process the queries backwards. The base state for each digit is the identity transformation.\n\n          Then, we process the queries from last to first.\n\n          After processing all queries, we have the transformation for each digit.\n\n          Then, we need to compute the value for the initial string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                (v, l) = (val[c], len_mod[c])\n                result = (result * pow(10, l, 1000000007) + v) % 1000000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The challenge is to efficiently compute the resulting number after all transformations, modulo 1000000007, without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a digit with a specified string. The key observation is that these transformations can be applied in reverse order, updating the transformation for each digit as we go. This allows us to avoid handling extremely large strings directly.\n2. **Insight**: By processing queries from last to first, we can dynamically update the transformation for each digit. For each digit, we maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the transformed digit, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length Modulo**: The length of the transformed digit's string, modulo 1000000006 (the totient of 1000000007), which helps in efficiently computing the power of 10 during value updates.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Start with each digit mapping to itself (value and length both equal to the digit).\n   - **Backward Processing**: For each query in reverse order, compute the new value and length for the digit being replaced by combining the values and lengths of the characters in its replacement string.\n   - **Final Computation**: After processing all queries, compute the final value of the original string by applying the transformations to each digit and combining their values and lengths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nPHI_MOD = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        queries.append((d, t_str))\n        \n    val = {}\n    len_mod = {}\n    \n    for digit in '0123456789':\n        val[digit] = int(digit)\n        len_mod[digit] = 1\n        \n    for i in range(len(queries) - 1, -1, -1):\n        d, t_str = queries[i]\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for char in t_str:\n            v = val[char]\n            l = len_mod[char]\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n            new_len = (new_len + l) % PHI_MOD\n        val[d] = new_val\n        len_mod[d] = new_len\n        \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        v = val[char]\n        l = len_mod[char]\n        result = (result * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial state maps each digit to itself, with its value being the digit itself and its length being 1.\n2. **Backward Query Processing**: For each query processed in reverse order, the digit specified in the query is updated. The new value is computed by combining the values of each character in the replacement string, shifted by the appropriate power of 10 (using the stored lengths). The new length is the sum of the lengths of the replacement characters, modulo 1000000006.\n3. **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, the original string is transformed by replacing each digit with its final value and length. The result is computed by iteratively combining these values, using the lengths to determine the necessary shifts (multiplications by powers of 10), all modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by leveraging modular arithmetic and dynamic updates, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
