Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters must be the same (and the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal has the same letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters? Let's read again: \n    - The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    - Then: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n   Input 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n   Output: NO\n\n Why? Because the center cell (which is part of both diagonals) is 's'. But wait, in the example, the diagonals must be the same letter? Actually, let's break down:\n\n Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter throughout. So for the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) we require:\n   - For the main diagonal: all letters are the same.\n   - For the anti-diagonal: all letters are the same.\n\n But note: the center cell is common to both diagonals. Therefore, the letter at the center must be the same for both diagonals.\n\n Condition 2: All non-diagonal cells must be the same letter, and that letter must be different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, in the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   The main diagonal: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not all same (because we have x, o, s). So condition 1 fails.\n\n   Example 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Main diagonal: ['w', 's', 'w'] -> not all same? Wait, but the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   Let me check the example again: \n        Input: 3\n               wsw\n               sws\n               wsw\n\n   The diagonals:\n        Main: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w' -> not all same.\n\n   Wait, this doesn't match our initial condition. But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   In the example, the main diagonal is not all same. Then why is it \"YES\"?\n\n   There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n   Looking at the example: \n        The example input is: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        And the expected output is \"YES\".\n\n   Let me draw the grid:\n\n        Row0: w s w\n        Row1: s w s\n        Row2: w s w\n\n   Now, the diagonals:\n\n        Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w','w','w'? Actually, no: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w'? Wait, wait, the second row is \"sws\": \n            Row0: index0: 'w', index1: 's', index2: 'w'\n            Row1: index0: 's', index1: 'w', index2: 's'\n            Row2: index0: 'w', index1: 's', index2: 'w'\n\n        So the main diagonal: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w'. \n        The anti-diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w'.\n\n        So both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n   But wait, in the example input string provided was: \n        ['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw']\n\n   However, in the example explanation above, the example input was written as:\n\n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n   But in the example, the second row is \"sws\", which is correct.\n\n   However, in the example input list, the second element is 'sws' (without the first letter being the same as the others?).\n\n   Correction: I think I made a mistake in reading the example. The example input is:\n\n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are:\n1. All letters on both diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) must be the same.\n2. All other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Letters from the top-left to the bottom-right. These should all be the same.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Letters from the top-right to the bottom-left. These should also all be the same.\n   - The center cell is common to both diagonals, so it must satisfy both conditions.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**:\n   - All cells not on either diagonal must be the same letter, and this letter must differ from the diagonal letter.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - If all conditions are met, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag_letter = None\n    anti_diag_letter = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        j = i\n        k = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != grid[i][k]:\n            diag_letter = None\n            break\n        \n        if grid[i][j] != grid[i][k]:\n            anti_diag_letter = None\n            break\n        \n        if diag_letter is None:\n            diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_letter:\n                diag_letter = None\n                break\n        \n        if anti_diag_letter is None:\n            anti_diag_letter = grid[i][k]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][k] != anti_diag_letter:\n                anti_diag_letter = None\n                break\n                \n    if diag_letter is None or anti_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if diag_letter != anti_diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    non_diag_letter = None\n                    break\n        if non_diag_letter is None:\n            break\n            \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_letter == diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks both diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) to ensure all letters are the same. The main diagonal runs from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal runs from top-right to bottom-left.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After verifying the diagonals, the code checks that all non-diagonal cells contain the same letter, which must differ from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, the code prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for the grid to form an \"X\" by systematically checking each required condition.",
