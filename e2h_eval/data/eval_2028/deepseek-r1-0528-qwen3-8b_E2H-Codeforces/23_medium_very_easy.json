In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in one line, but the example input is given as a list of three strings. Actually, the input format is: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n But note: the example input is shown as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n However, looking at the problem statement: \n   \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n Actually, wait: the example input has three examples? But the problem says there is only one line.\n\n Let me re-read: \n   Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n And each string is a tile representation? Or is it that the entire hand is given as three tiles?\n\n Actually, the example input is provided as three separate strings in the example, but the problem says the input is one line containing three strings.\n\n But wait: the example input is written as:\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing. Actually, the problem states: \n     The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n Then the input example is:\n\n     Input\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But that is not standard input. In standard competitive programming, we read from stdin and the input is given as one line.\n\n Let me clarify: the input is one line with three strings (each string being a tile) or three tokens?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand\" — meaning three tiles. So the input will have three tokens, each token is a string of two characters: first digit, then one of 'm','p','s'.\n\n Example: \n   Input line: \"1s2s3s\" — but wait, that would be three tiles concatenated? \n\n No, the example output shows three different cases. The problem actually gives three examples in one input? \n\n Wait, no. The problem says: \n     Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n And then they show three examples:\n\n     Example 1: Input \"1s 2s 3s\"\n     Example 2: Input \"9m 9m 9m\"\n     Example 3: Input \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But note: the example input is written as:\n\n         ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n That is three separate inputs? Or the input is one line with three tiles?\n\n Actually, reading the problem again: it says \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning one line with three strings. But then how is the third example given? \n\n The third example input is \"3p 9m 2p\", which is three tiles. So the input format is:\n\n     One line with three strings, each string representing one tile.\n\n However, wait: the example input is written as:\n\n         Input\n         ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But that is a list of three strings. In reality, the input is a single line that contains three strings separated by spaces? Or three space separated tokens?\n\n Actually, the problem says \"three strings\", so we can split the input line by space to get three tokens.\n\n But wait: the example input for the third test case is \"3p 9m 2p\", which is three tokens.\n\n However, the first two examples are given as:\n\n        Example 1: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n        Example 2: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n\n But note: the second example has three identical tiles? Actually, the second example input is \"9m 9m 9m\", meaning three tiles of '9m'. \n\n How should we parse the input?\n\n Since the problem says \"the only line contains three strings\", we can assume the input is split into three parts by whitespace.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n   Then we have three tokens: ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\n   Input: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n   Then we have three tokens: ['9m','9m','9m']\n\n   Input: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n   Then we have three tokens: ['3p','9m','2p']\n\n So we can do:\n\n   tiles = input().split()\n\n But note: what if the input is given without spaces? The problem does not specify. However, the example input is given with spaces separating the tiles.\n\n But the problem says: \"the only line contains three strings\", meaning three tokens. So we can safely split.\n\n Steps:\n\n We have three tiles. Each tile is represented as a string of length 2: [digit][suit]\n\n Conditions:\n\n 1. Check if already there is a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n 2. If yes, then answer 0.\n\n 3. Otherwise, we consider drawing extra tiles. We can draw any tile (any suit, any number) arbitrarily many times.\n\n What are the possibilities?\n\n We start with 3 tiles. We can draw 0, 1, 2, ... tiles.\n\n Note: We don't necessarily need to complete a set of 4 or more. We just need at least one mentsu (which is 3 tiles). \n\n However, we can also use some of the existing tiles to form a mentsu and leave the rest.\n\n Possibilities for forming a mentsu:\n\n - Koutsu: three identical tiles. We can form a triplet by having three of the same tile.\n\n - Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n We are allowed to draw any number of tiles (minimum number).\n\n We are only concerned with the minimum number of draws.\n\n Since we have three tiles, we can consider:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0.\n\n Case 1: Not having a mentsu, but maybe we can form one by drawing 1 tile.\n\n How?\n\n For koutsu: \n   We can look at the counts of each tile.\n\n   For example, if we have two identical tiles, then we need one more to complete a koutsu.\n\n   If we have one tile, then we need two more.\n\n   But note: we can draw any tile. So if we have two of the same, then drawing one more of that same tile gives us a koutsu.\n\n   Similarly, if we have one, then we can draw two of the same, but that would be two draws.\n\n For shuntsu:\n\n   We need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   We might have two tiles that are consecutive (or one step apart) and then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n   Example: [3p, 5p] -> we can draw 4p to form [3p,4p,5p].\n\n   But note: the example input: \"3p 9m 2p\". They drew one tile (either 1p or 4p) to form a shuntsu.\n\n   However, in the hand [3p, 9m, 2p]: \n        Tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\n   We cannot ignore the 9m? Actually, we don't have to use all tiles. We just need one mentsu (any three tiles). So we can choose two tiles from the hand and the drawn one.\n\n   But wait: the hand has three tiles. When we draw one, we have four. We can form a mentsu from three of them.\n\n   So we don't necessarily have to use all the tiles.\n\n   Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use two of our tiles and one drawn tile to form a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n   Option 2: Use one of our tiles and two drawn tiles.\n\n   Option 3: Use zero of our tiles and three drawn tiles.\n\n   However, we are to find the minimum number of draws.\n\n   We know:\n\n   - If we already have a mentsu (0 draws), done.\n\n   - Else, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 1 tile.\n\n   How to check for 1 tile?\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   For koutsu: \n      For each distinct tile, count how many we have.\n\n      If we have two of a tile, then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more.\n\n      Also, if we have one of a tile, we cannot complete a koutsu in one draw.\n\n   For shuntsu:\n\n      We can group by suit.\n\n      For a fixed suit, let the numbers present be sorted.\n\n      Then, for each pair (or even single) in the same suit, we can check if we can form a shuntsu by adding one tile.\n\n      Example: \n        [x, y] (same suit) -> if |x-y| = 1, then we can form a shuntsu by adding the missing one (min-1 or max+1) but wait: \n        Actually, we need three consecutive. So if we have two numbers, say [a, b] (a < b), then we can form a shuntsu if there exists an integer c such that {a, b, c} forms three consecutive numbers.\n\n        Specifically, if b == a+1, then we need c = a-1 or c = b+1. But note: the numbers must be consecutive.\n\n        Actually, the sequence must be n, n+1, n+2.\n\n        So if we have two numbers, then the gap between them must be 2 or less.\n\n        Cases:\n          Case 1: two numbers with gap 1: [a, a+1] -> then we can form [a-1, a, a+1] if a-1>=1, or [a, a+1, a+2] if a+2<=9.\n          Case 2: two numbers with gap 2: [a, a+2] -> then we can form [a, a+1, a+2] by adding a+1.\n\n        But note: we are only allowed to add one tile. So:\n\n          If we have two numbers in the same suit and the difference is 1, then we can complete the sequence in two ways (if both ends are available) but we can only add one tile. Actually, we can only complete one of the two possibilities. However, we are only adding one tile, so we can complete either the lower part or the upper part.\n\n          Example: [2,3] -> we can add 1 to form [1,2,3] or 4 to form [2,3,4]. Both are valid. So if we have two consecutive, then one draw suffices.\n\n          If we have two numbers with gap 2, then we can only complete the middle: [a, a+2] becomes [a, a+1, a+2] by adding a+1.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the added tile is within 1 to 9.\n\n        Also, we can have three numbers? Then we already have a shuntsu.\n\n        But wait: we are checking for 1 draw. We have three tiles total. We are going to use two of them (from the same suit) and one drawn tile.\n\n        Alternatively, we might have three tiles in the same suit, but they are not consecutive. Then we can complete by one draw?\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m (but then we have two 3m? Actually, we can use the drawn tile only once. So we can form either [1,2,3] or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m. But note: we have three tiles: 1m,2m,4m. If we draw 3m, then we have four tiles. We can form a shuntsu [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. So yes, one draw.\n\n        However, we can also consider using two of the same tile for koutsu.\n\n        Therefore, for shuntsu, we can have:\n\n          - Two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive (gap=1): then one draw (to complete either side) is enough.\n\n          - Two tiles in the same suit that have gap=2: then one draw (the middle) is enough.\n\n          - Three tiles in the same suit that are consecutive? Then we already have a shuntsu (so 0 draws).\n\n          - Three tiles in the same suit that are not consecutive: then we might need more than one draw.\n\n        But wait: we are only considering one draw.\n\n        Also, we might have multiple suits. We can form a mentsu from one suit.\n\n        Steps for 1 draw:\n\n          Check for koutsu: \n            If there is any tile that appears at least twice, then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more.\n\n          Check for shuntsu:\n            Group by suit, then for each suit, consider the set of numbers.\n\n            For a given suit, let S be the set of numbers (as integers).\n\n            We can check for each possible starting point n (from 1 to 7) such that n, n+1, n+2 are in S. Then we already have a shuntsu.\n\n            But we are checking for one draw: so we need to see if we can form a shuntsu by adding one tile.\n\n            We can iterate over the suits and the numbers we have, and for each pair (or even triple) in the same suit, check if we can complete a sequence with one draw.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: for a given suit, what are the gaps in the numbers we have? \n\n            However, note: we can use any two or one of the numbers to form a sequence.\n\n            Actually, we have at most three tiles in a suit (because total three tiles). \n\n            So for a given suit, the number of tiles in that suit can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n            If we have three tiles in the same suit, then we can check if they form a shuntsu (then 0 draws). If not, then we can try to complete by one draw? \n\n            Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> not consecutive, but we can complete [1,2,3] or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m. So even though we have three tiles, we might need one draw.\n\n            However, wait: we are only allowed to draw one tile, and we have three tiles. We can form a mentsu from three of the four? But note: the problem does not require to use all tiles. We just need one mentsu (any three). \n\n            So we can use two of our tiles and the drawn one to form a shuntsu.\n\n            But note: the definition of shuntsu requires three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit.\n\n            So we can form a shuntsu by:\n\n              Option A: Using the three tiles we have (if they form a shuntsu) -> 0 draws.\n\n              Option B: Using two of our tiles and one drawn tile (if we can form a shuntsu) -> 1 draw.\n\n            Therefore, we need to check:\n\n              For koutsu: \n                Count the frequency of each tile. \n                If any tile appears at least 2 times, then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more (so answer 1).\n\n              For shuntsu: \n                For each suit, consider the set of numbers we have in that suit.\n\n                Then, for the same suit, we can try to form a shuntsu by adding one tile.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  Let the set of numbers in the suit be S (non-empty).\n\n                  We need to check for each n from 1 to 7: \n                    The set {n, n+1, n+2} minus S should have size <= 1 (since we can draw one tile to complete).\n\n                  But note: we can also consider sequences that are contained in the current set plus one missing.\n\n                  Actually, we can check for every consecutive triplet that is missing exactly one number.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can check: \n\n                    Let T = sorted(S)\n                    Then, we can consider the entire set of numbers from 1 to 9 for this suit and check for consecutive triplets.\n\n                  However, we can also consider: \n\n                    For each number x in S, consider the triplet that has x as the smallest, middle, or largest.\n\n                    But simpler: \n\n                    We can consider every consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) for n from 1 to 7.\n\n                    Then, the number of missing tiles in the triplet is 3 - |S ∩ {n, n+1, n+2}|.\n\n                    We want to know if there exists a triplet for which the number of missing tiles is 1.\n\n                    But note: we are only allowed to draw one tile, so if the triplet requires one missing tile, then we can complete it with one draw.\n\n                    However, we must ensure that the drawn tile is not already present? Actually, we can draw any tile, even if we have duplicates? But note: we are only drawing one tile, and we are allowed to draw duplicates? \n\n                    The problem says: \"including those already in her hand\". So we can draw a tile that is already present.\n\n                    But wait: if we have two of the same tile, then we can use one of them and the drawn one (which is the same) to form a triplet? Actually, no: the triplet is defined as three identical tiles.\n\n                    However, we are forming a shuntsu, so we are not using three identical tiles.\n\n                    So for shuntsu, we are looking for three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n                    Therefore, we cannot use duplicate numbers in the same triplet.\n\n                    So the drawn tile must be the one that is missing and not already present.\n\n                    But note: if the missing tile is already present? Then we don't need to draw it. But wait, we are counting the missing tiles: we are only allowed to draw one tile. So if the triplet has two missing, we cannot fix with one draw.\n\n                    Actually, the condition is: for a triplet {n, n+1, n+2}, the number of tiles we have in this triplet is k. Then we need 3-k tiles to complete. But we are only allowed to draw one. So we require 3-k <= 1, i.e., k>=2.\n\n                    And also, the missing tiles must be exactly one and we can draw that one.\n\n                    However, what if the missing tile is already present in another part of the hand? \n\n                    Example: We have [1m, 1m, 2m] and we are checking the triplet [1,2,3]. We have two 1m and one 2m. Then the triplet [1,2,3] requires one more 3m. But we don't have 3m. So we can draw 3m.\n\n                    But note: the triplet must be three distinct numbers. So we cannot use the two 1m together in the triplet because the triplet requires distinct numbers. Actually, no: the triplet for shuntsu is about three consecutive distinct numbers.\n\n                    So we can use one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m. We have two 1m, so we have one extra 1m. But that doesn't matter.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition for a triplet {n, n+1, n+2} is that we have at least one of n, at least one of n+1, and at least one of n+2? Actually, no: we can have multiple copies, but the shuntsu only requires one of each.\n\n                    So for the triplet {n, n+1, n+2}, we need at least one of each. \n\n                    Now, how many of these three do we have?\n\n                    We can count the intersection of S (the set of numbers in the suit) with {n, n+1, n+2}. \n\n                    Then, the number of missing numbers in the triplet is 3 - |{n, n+1, n+2} ∩ S|.\n\n                    And we can complete the triplet by drawing the missing ones. But we are limited to one draw, so we require 3 - |intersection| == 1.\n\n                    But note: we are only considering the numbers we have in that suit.\n\n                    Example: \n                      Hand: ['1m','2m','4m'] and we are checking the triplet [1,2,3]:\n                          Intersection: {1,2} -> size 2, so missing 3 -> one draw.\n\n                      Hand: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> already have the triplet.\n\n                    However, what if we have duplicates? \n                      Hand: ['1m','1m','2m'] and triplet [1,2,3]: \n                          Intersection: {1,2} -> size 2, so missing 3 -> one draw.\n\n                    But note: we can also consider the triplet [2,3,4] for the hand ['1m','1m','2m']: \n                          Intersection: {2} -> size 1, so missing 3 and 4 -> two draws. Not applicable.\n\n                    Therefore, for a given suit, we can check all triplets (n from 1 to 7) and if any triplet has exactly two of the three numbers present, then we can complete it with one draw.\n\n                    However, we must also note: the triplet must be entirely in that suit.\n\n                    Additionally, we can consider koutsu and shuntsu separately.\n\n                    So overall, we can do:\n\n                    Step 0: Check if we already have a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu). If yes, return 0.\n\n                    Step 1: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n                    Conditions for one draw:\n\n                      Condition A (koutsu): There exists a tile (say, \"x\") that we have at least two copies. Then we can draw one more \"x\" to complete a triplet.\n\n                      Condition B (shuntsu): There exists a suit and a triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that we have at least two of the three numbers in that triplet (in the same suit). Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n                    However, note: we might have two conditions simultaneously. But we are only interested in the minimum draws.\n\n                    But note: we are only drawing one tile. So if either condition holds, then we can complete in one draw.\n\n                    Step 2: If not, then check if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    Conditions for two draws:\n\n                      Condition C (koutsu): There exists a tile that we have at least one copy. Then we can draw two more of that tile to complete a triplet. (But wait, we can also complete a shuntsu with two draws.)\n\n                      Condition D (shuntsu): There exists a suit and a triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that we have at least one of the three numbers. Then we can draw the two missing ones.\n\n                    However, note: we can also mix and match: for example, we might have two different tiles and we can form a triplet by drawing two of a new tile (if we have one of that tile) or form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    But note: we can also use two of our tiles to form part of a shuntsu and then draw two more to complete two different parts? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n                    However, we can consider:\n\n                      - To form a koutsu: we can take one tile (any tile) and draw two copies of that tile. (This is one possibility.)\n\n                      - To form a shuntsu: we can take one tile (say, a suit and a number) and then we need two consecutive numbers in the same suit. We can draw two tiles to complete the two missing.\n\n                    But wait: we might have two tiles that are not in the same suit. Then we can choose a suit and form a shuntsu from scratch: draw three tiles for a shuntsu? But we are checking two draws.\n\n                    Actually, we are allowed to draw two tiles. We can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles: \n\n                      Example: hand [1m, 1p] -> we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] in m. But wait, we don't have 1m already? Actually, we have one 1m. Then we can use the existing 1m and draw 2m and 3m.\n\n                    However, we can also form a koutsu by drawing two of the same tile if we have at least one.\n\n                    Therefore, for two draws:\n\n                      Condition A': There exists a tile that we have at least one copy. Then we can complete a koutsu by drawing two more (so two draws).\n\n                      Condition B': There exists a suit and a triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that we have at least one of the three numbers. Then we can complete the triplet by drawing the two missing ones (so two draws).\n\n                    However, note: we might have two tiles that are consecutive and in the same suit, and then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile (already considered above). So we are now considering two draws.\n\n                    But wait: is there a possibility that we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles that is not covered by these conditions?\n\n                    Actually, note: we can also form a mentsu by combining two tiles from the hand and two drawn tiles? \n\n                    Actually, the mentsu is three tiles. We can use:\n\n                      - Three drawn tiles: then we need three draws.\n\n                    But we are checking two draws: so we must use at least one of the hand.\n\n                    The conditions above (A' and B') assume we use at least one from the hand.\n\n                    However, there is another possibility: we might use two tiles from the hand to form part of the mentsu and then draw one or two.\n\n                    But we have already considered:\n\n                      One draw: \n                        - koutsu: two copies of a tile and draw one to make three.\n                        - shuntsu: two (or one) copies of two numbers (in the same suit) and draw one to complete the consecutive.\n\n                    Two draws:\n\n                      - koutsu: one copy of a tile and draw two to make three.\n\n                      - shuntsu: one copy of a number in a suit and draw two to complete the consecutive.\n\n                    But also, we might have two tiles that are not in the same suit and not the same, and we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that connect them? \n\n                    Example: hand [1m, 4p] -> we can form a shuntsu by drawing 2m and 3m? Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4p). But that uses two draws.\n\n                    However, we can also form a shuntsu in p: we have 4p, then we can draw 3p and 2p to form [2p,3p,4p]. \n\n                    So the condition B' covers this.\n\n                    Therefore, the conditions for two draws are:\n\n                      Condition A': There exists at least one tile (any tile) that we have at least one copy. Then we can complete a koutsu by drawing two copies.\n\n                      Condition B': There exists a suit and a triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that we have at least one tile in that triplet (i.e., at least one of the three numbers in that suit). Then we can complete the triplet by drawing the other two.\n\n                    However, note: we might have multiple suits and multiple triplets. We only need one mentsu.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have three tiles, and none of the above conditions hold for one draw, but we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles in a different way? \n\n                    Actually, the above conditions for two draws are sufficient.\n\n                    However, there is a catch: \n\n                      Condition A' requires at least one copy of a tile. But we have three tiles, so we have at least one copy of some tile? \n\n                      Actually, if we have three distinct tiles, then we have at least one copy for each. \n\n                      Example: ['1m','2p','3s'] -> then we have one copy of each.\n\n                    So Condition A' always holds if we have at least one tile (which we do). Then two draws would always be a solution? \n\n                    But wait: we are trying to find the minimum. We already checked 0 and 1. Now we are checking 2.\n\n                    However, Condition A' is not the only way to form a mentsu by two draws. We can also form a shuntsu by two draws (Condition B').\n\n                    But note: Condition A' is always true (since we have three tiles, we have at least one tile). Then two draws is always achievable? \n\n                    Then the answer would be at most 2.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have three identical tiles? Then we have a koutsu (0 draws). \n\n                    What if we have two identical and one different? Then we can complete the koutsu by one draw (if the two identical are the same) -> Condition A' for one draw: we have two of a kind, so we can complete by one draw.\n\n                    What if we have three distinct tiles, but they form a shuntsu? Then 0 draws.\n\n                    What if we have three distinct tiles, not a shuntsu and not two identical? Then we can complete by one draw if we can form a shuntsu (Condition B) or koutsu (Condition A). \n\n                    Condition A: if we have two identical? Then Condition A holds.\n\n                    But in three distinct tiles, we don't have two identical.\n\n                    Then Condition A fails for one draw.\n\n                    Condition B: we check the suits and the consecutive triplets.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> Condition B: for suit m, we have {1,2,4}. \n                      Check triplet [1,2,3]: missing 3 -> Condition B holds (one draw).\n\n                    Another example: ['1m','3m','5m'] -> Condition B: \n                      Check triplet [1,2,3]: missing 2 -> but we don't have 2 -> not complete by one draw.\n                      Check triplet [2,3,4]: missing 2 and 4 -> two draws needed for this triplet? Actually, we can also consider [3,4,5]: missing 4 -> one draw. So Condition B holds.\n\n                    But wait: we have 3m and 5m. We can form [3,4,5] by drawing 4m.\n\n                    So Condition B: for the triplet [3,4,5] we have two numbers (3 and 5) -> missing one (4) -> one draw.\n\n                    Therefore, Condition B holds.\n\n                    Now, consider a hand that doesn't have any two identical and cannot form a shuntsu by one draw:\n\n                    Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> three different suits, same number.\n\n                    Condition A (one draw): we have two identical? No, we have one of each. Condition A fails.\n\n                    Condition B (one draw): \n                      Suit m: {1} -> check triplets: \n                         [1,2,3]: missing 2 and 3 -> two draws needed for this triplet? Actually, we can only complete one triplet per suit. But we have one tile in m, so for the triplet [1,2,3] we are missing two. Similarly for p and s.\n\n                    So Condition B fails.\n\n                    Then we go to two draws.\n\n                    Condition A' (two draws): we have at least one tile (we do). So we can complete a koutsu by drawing two more of, say, 1m. Then we have [1m,1m,1m] (and the other two tiles are left). So two draws.\n\n                    Condition B' (two draws): we can complete a shuntsu in one suit. For example, in m: we have 1m, then we need two more: 2m and 3m. So we draw 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m]. So two draws.\n\n                    Therefore, two draws is the answer.\n\n                    But wait: can we complete two different triplets? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n                    However, note: the problem asks the minimum number of draws.\n\n                    Is there a possibility that we can complete a mentsu by drawing two tiles that are not necessarily the same as the ones we have? \n\n                    Yes, the above conditions cover.\n\n                    Therefore, the answer can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n                    But note: we can always draw three tiles to form a shuntsu (by drawing three consecutive numbers in a suit). However, we might do better.\n\n                    However, we have shown that if we cannot do 0 or 1, then we can do 2. Then what about 3?\n\n                    Actually, the above conditions for two draws (Condition A' and Condition B') are always satisfied if we have at least one tile (which we do). \n\n                    Therefore, the maximum answer is 2.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have three tiles that are all of the same suit and consecutive? Then we have a shuntsu (0 draws).\n\n                    What if we have three tiles that are the same? Then we have a koutsu (0 draws).\n\n                    What if we have two same and one different? Then Condition A (one draw) holds.\n\n                    What if we have three distinct tiles, but they are all in the same suit and consecutive? Then Condition B (one draw) holds.\n\n                    What if we have three distinct tiles, but they are all in the same suit and not consecutive, but we can complete by one draw (like [1,3,5] -> we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing 4, or [1,2,3] by drawing 2) -> Condition B holds.\n\n                    What if we have three distinct tiles, and they are in different suits and not consecutive? Then Condition A and Condition B fail for one draw, so we use two draws.\n\n                    Then the answer is at most 2.\n\n                    However, wait: is there a hand that requires three draws?\n\n                    Consider: ['1m','2p','3s'] -> three distinct tiles, each tile is unique and not forming a shuntsu (because different suits) and no two identical (so no koutsu). \n\n                    Condition A (one draw): no two identical -> fails.\n                    Condition B (one draw): \n                      For m: {1} -> no triplet can be completed with one draw (because we need two more consecutive, which requires two draws).\n                      For p: {2} -> same.\n                      For s: {3} -> same.\n\n                    Then we go to two draws.\n\n                    Condition A' (two draws): we can complete a koutsu by drawing two more 1m (for example) -> then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the other two tiles. So two draws.\n\n                    Condition B' (two draws): we can complete a shuntsu in m: [1,2,3] by drawing 2m and 3m (but wait, we already have 1m, so we draw 2m and 3m -> then we have [1m,2m,3m] (and the other two tiles). So two draws.\n\n                    Therefore, two draws.\n\n                    But wait: is there a hand that requires three draws?\n\n                    Consider: we have three tiles, and we cannot form a mentsu by drawing 0, 1, or 2 tiles.\n\n                    However, note: Condition A' and Condition B' always hold if we have at least one tile (which we do). \n\n                    Therefore, the answer is never 3.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have three tiles that are, say, [1m, 1m, 1m]? Then 0.\n\n                    [1m,1m,2m] -> Condition A: two 1m -> one draw.\n\n                    [1m,2m,3m] -> Condition B: already a shuntsu -> 0.\n\n                    [1m,2m,4m] -> Condition B: one draw.\n\n                    [1m,1p,1s] -> two draws.\n\n                    [1m,2p,3s] -> two draws.\n\n                    [1m,1m,4m] -> Condition A: two 1m -> one draw.\n\n                    [1m,4m,7m] -> Condition B: check for m: {1,4,7}. \n                      Check triplets: \n                        [1,2,3]: missing 2,3 -> two draws needed (but we are checking one draw: Condition B requires exactly two of the three numbers. Here, we have one (1) in [1,2,3] -> not two. Similarly, [4,5,6]: missing 5,6 -> one present (4) -> not two. [7,8,9]: missing 8,9 -> one present (7) -> not two. So Condition B fails for one draw.\n\n                    Then Condition A: we don't have two identical (only one 1m) -> fails.\n\n                    Then we go to two draws.\n\n                    Condition A",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**: If no mentsu is found, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu**: If there are at least two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu**: If there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit missing exactly one tile, drawing that missing tile completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two Draws**: If neither of the above conditions is met, we check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu**: Drawing two more tiles of the same type as any existing tile.\n   - **Shuntsu**: Drawing two tiles to complete a sequence in any suit where at least one tile of the sequence is present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = [tile[0] + tile[1] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for koutsu (triplet) or shuntsu (sequence) in the hand\n    has_koutsu = False\n    has_shuntsu = False\n\n    # Count frequency and group by suit\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    suit_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = tile[0]\n        suit = tile[1]\n        count_dict[tile] += 1\n        suit_dict[suit].append(num)\n        \n    # Check for koutsu: any tile with count >= 3?\n    for tile, cnt in count_dict.items():\n        if cnt >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu: same suit and consecutive numbers\n    for suit, nums in suit_dict.items():\n        nums_set = set(nums)\n        n = len(nums_set)\n        if n >= 3:\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums_set)\n            for i in range(len(sorted_nums) - 2):\n                if sorted_nums[i+1] == sorted_nums[i] + 1 and sorted_nums[i+2] == sorted_nums[i] + 2:\n                    has_shuntsu = True\n                    break\n        else:\n            if n == 0:\n                continue\n            min_num = min(nums_set)\n            max_num = max(nums_set)\n            if max_num - min_num == 2:\n                has_shuntsu = True\n            elif max_num - min_num == 1:\n                has_shuntsu = True\n            else:\n                for num in nums_set:\n                    for start in range(num-2, num+1):\n                        if start < 1:\n                            continue\n                        if start + 2 <= 9:\n                            triplet = {start, start+1, start+2}\n                            if triplet.issubset(nums_set):\n                                has_shuntsu = True\n                                break\n                    if has_shuntsu:\n                        break\n\n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one draw\n    # Koutsu: any tile with count 2 -> draw one more\n    for tile, cnt in count_dict.items():\n        if cnt == 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # Shuntsu: check if there's a suit with numbers that can form a sequence with one missing\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    for suit in suits:\n        if suit not in suit_dict:\n            continue\n        nums_list = suit_dict[suit]\n        nums_set = set(nums_list)\n        n = len(nums_set)\n        if n >= 3:\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums_set)\n            for i in range(len(sorted_nums) - 2):\n                if sorted_nums[i+1] == sorted_nums[i] + 1 and sorted_nums[i+2] == sorted_nums[i] + 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n        else:\n            if n == 0:\n                continue\n            min_num = min(nums_list)\n            max_num = max(nums_list)\n            if max_num - min_num == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n            elif max_num - min_num == 1:\n                print(1)\n                return\n            else:\n                for num in nums_set:\n                    for start in range(num-2, num+1):\n                        if start < 1:\n                            continue\n                        triplet = {start, start+1, start+2}\n                        if triplet.issubset(nums_set):\n                            print(1)\n                            return\n\n    # Check for two draws\n    # Koutsu: any tile with count>=1 -> can draw two more\n    if any(count_dict.values()):\n        print(2)\n        return\n\n    # Shuntsu: any suit with at least one tile -> can draw two more to complete a sequence\n    for suit in suits:\n        if suit in suit_dict:\n            print(2)\n            return\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the hand already contains a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). If found, it immediately returns 0.\n2. **One Draw Check**: The code checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. For triplets, it looks for two identical tiles. For sequences, it checks if any three consecutive numbers in the same suit are missing exactly one tile.\n3. **Two Draws Check**: If forming a mentsu isn't possible with zero or one draw, the code checks if two draws can suffice. This involves either completing a triplet by drawing two more tiles of the same type or completing a sequence by drawing two missing tiles in a suit.\n4. **Fallback**: If none of the above conditions are met, the solution defaults to two draws, as it is always possible to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles given the initial three tiles. \n\nThis approach efficiently covers all possible scenarios to determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a mentsu, ensuring optimal performance even for edge cases.",
