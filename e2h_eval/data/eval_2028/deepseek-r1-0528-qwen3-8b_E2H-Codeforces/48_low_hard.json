            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b (each between 2 and 25) OR one integer a and the string \"R\" for b.\n Then, the next line is a non-negative integer c in base a (with possible leading zeros, but the string length <= 1000). The number can be very large (up to 10^1510 in base 10? Actually note: the input says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" -> wait, that is confusing. Actually, the problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" which might be a typo. But note: if not Roman, then the number is represented in base a (which is at least 2, at most 25) and the string length <= 1000. So the number can be very big.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\" -> This seems like a typo. Actually, the intended meaning might be that the number is nonnegative, and when converting from base a to base b (which is an integer base), the number might be very large. But the Roman numeral part has a constraint that the number is at most 300010 (and not zero).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the first line and split into tokens. There will be two tokens: either two integers or one integer and the string \"R\".\n\n 2. Read the next line as the string representing the number in base a.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n        Convert the given string (in base a) to a decimal integer (or maybe directly to a number, but note: the number is nonnegative and the base a is between 2 and 25). Then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n    However, note: the input number c is given in base a. So first we need to convert the string (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer? Or can we handle without converting to base-10?\n\n    But the problem says: the input is a nonnegative integer in base a. So we can convert the string from base a to base-10 (as an integer). Then, if b is 'R', convert that base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n    But note: the problem says the Roman numeral input condition: the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n 4. If b is an integer:\n        Convert the string (base a) to a base-10 integer. Then convert that base-10 integer to base b (with base b between 2 and 25). However, the problem says that the number in non-Roman cases can be very large (but note: the input representation is a string of up to 1000 digits in base a, so the base-10 integer might be huge). But the base b is at most 25, so we can do the conversion by repeated division only if the base-10 integer is not too huge? \n\n    However, note: the base-10 integer might be extremely large because the base a is at least 2 and the string can have up to 1000 digits. For example, if base a=25 and the string is 1000 digits, that is 25^1000 which is way beyond what Python can handle with integers (unless we use arbitrary precision, but 25^1000 is about 10^1505, which is too big for standard integers in terms of being converted to base b by simple modulus operations? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the modulus and division operations on such huge numbers might be slow and memory-consuming.\n\n    Alternatively, we can convert the base a string to base-10 without building the entire number at once? But base a is small (2 to 25). We can use:\n\n        num = 0\n        for digit in s:\n            num = num * a + int(digit)   # but wait, the string may contain letters for bases above 10.\n\n    However, the input string for base a (with a>=11) uses letters: 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc. up to base 25 (which would use 'N' for 23, 'O' for 24, 'P' for 25? Actually, the problem says:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base (a) to a base-10 integer, and then converting that integer to the desired output base (b), which could be either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and target base (b). The target base might be \"R\" for Roman numerals.\n2. **String Conversion to Base-10**: Convert the input string (representing a number in base a) into a base-10 integer. This involves processing each digit or character in the string, converting them from their respective values (handling digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases above 10), and accumulating the total value.\n3. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base (b)**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base-10 integer to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped to corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Z for bases above 10).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is \"R\", convert the base-10 integer to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral formation, including subtractive notation for numbers like 4 (IV) and 9 (IX).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numeral(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in val:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid base a\")\n        return\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        base_b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            base_b = int(b_str)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid base b\")\n            return\n\n    def convert_to_base10(s, base):\n        total = 0\n        power = 1\n        for i, char in enumerate(reversed(s)):\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            else:\n                return None\n            if digit >= base:\n                return None\n            total += digit * power\n            power *= base\n        return total\n\n    base10_num = convert_to_base10(num_str, base_a)\n\n    if base10_num is None:\n        print(\"Invalid digit in input string\")\n        return\n\n    if base10_num == 0:\n        print(\"\")\n        return\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        result = roman_numeral(base10_num)\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        base = base_b\n        digits = []\n        n = base10_num\n        while n > 0:\n            remainder = n % base\n            n = n // base\n            if remainder < 10:\n                digits.append(str(remainder))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the first line to get the source base (a) and target base (b). The second line is the number string to be converted.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The `convert_to_base10` function processes each character of the input string, converting it from its base-a value to a base-10 integer. For bases higher than 10, letters (A-Z) represent values 10 to 35.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The `roman_numeral` function converts a base-10 integer to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard bases, the program repeatedly divides the base-10 number by the target base, collecting remainders which are then mapped to digits (0-9 or A-Z for bases above 10). The digits are reversed to form the correct output string.\n5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles invalid inputs (like invalid bases or digits) and zero values appropriately, ensuring robustness and correctness.",
