She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open.\n\n There are two main types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor (left/right) one tab at a time, but note that the boundaries change as tabs are closed.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that the problem allows closing either side from the current cursor position, and the boundaries a and b update as we close tabs.\n\n Observation:\n We need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. This means we must close tabs from 1 to l-1 (if any) and from r+1 to n (if any).\n\n There are several cases:\n\n Case 1: If the desired segment [l, r] is the entire set of tabs (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have two sides to close: left (if l > 1) and right (if r < n).\n\n We can consider two main strategies:\n\n Strategy A: First close the left part, then the right part.\n   Steps for left: \n        - Move the cursor to the left until we are at l (or just beyond? but note we can close from the left only when the cursor is at a position such that we can cover the left part).\n        Actually, note: to close the left part, we must be at a tab that is >= l (so that after closing the left, the new left boundary becomes the current tab). But wait, the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close everything from the current minimum index (which is the left boundary) up to the cursor's left. However, initially the left boundary is 1, but after closing some tabs, it might be higher.\n\n How does the problem define the boundaries?\n   Initially, a = 1, b = n.\n   After closing some tabs, a and b are updated to the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab.\n\n Important: The problem says that after closing, the tabs are gone, so the cursor can't move to a closed tab. The boundaries a and b are the extreme unclosed tabs.\n\n Operation examples:\n   Example 1: Input \"6 3 2 4\"\n        n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n        Steps:\n          1. Move the cursor from 3 to 2 (1 second): now at tab 2.\n          2. Close all the tabs to the left of the cursor (closing [a, 1] i.e., [1,1]): now the tabs are [2,3,4,5,6] becomes [2,3,4,5,6] (but wait, we closed [1,1] so the left boundary a becomes 2). Now the boundaries are a=2, b=6.\n          3. Then move the cursor from 2 to 4 (from 2 to 3 to 4: 2 seconds) -> total 3 seconds so far.\n          4. Close all the tabs to the right (from [5,6] to [4,?] i.e., [5,6]): now the tabs are [2,3,4]. So we did 3 + 1 = 4 seconds? But the example says 5.\n\n        Let me recount the example's provided solution:\n\n          shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (1 second)\n          close all the tabs to the left (operation: 1 second) -> now 2 seconds.\n          shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3 (3rd second)\n          then to the tab 4 (4th second)\n          then close all the tabs to the right (5th second)\n\n        So total 5 seconds.\n\n        Why didn't they do the right closure earlier? Because after closing the left, the right boundary hasn't changed and we still need to close the right.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe we can do:\n\n          Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n          Steps:\n            Move from pos (3) to l (2): |3-2| = 1 move (to the left) -> 1 second.\n            Close left: 1 second. Now the left is closed and the left boundary becomes 2. The cursor is at 2.\n            Then we need to move from 2 to r (4): |4-2| = 2 moves (to the right twice) -> 2 seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n          Option 2: Maybe we can combine by moving to the center of the segment?\n\n          Another option: perhaps we can close the right part first?\n\n          Steps for closing right first:\n            We must be at a tab that is <= r (and then we can close the right). The cursor is initially at 3, which is in [2,4]. So we can close the right from 3: but wait, if we close the right, we close [4+1, ...] but our desired segment includes 4. Actually, note: the operation \"close all the tabs to the right\" would close from [i+1, b] (where b is the current right boundary). Initially, b is 6. So if we are at 3, then closing right would close [4,5,6] (because 3+1=4). That would leave [1,2,3] which is not what we want because we want [2,4]. So we cannot close the entire right from 3 because that closes too much.\n\n          Therefore, we must be careful: we can only close the parts that are outside [l, r]. The operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" when the cursor is at i will close from a to i-1. Similarly, \"close all the tabs to the right\" will close from i+1 to b.\n\n          Conditions for closing:\n            - To close the left part (tabs 1 to l-1), we must have the cursor at a tab i such that i >= l (so that after closing, the left boundary becomes at least l). Actually, the operation will close from a to i-1. But if we are at a tab i that is less than l, then we would close from a to i-1, which includes [l, i-1] (if i-1 >= l) or even beyond [l-1] (if i-1 >= l). But wait, we want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close any tab above l. Therefore, we must ensure that when we close the left, we are at a tab i such that i-1 < l (so that the operation doesn't close the desired tab l). However, note that the operation closes from a to i-1, and initially a=1. But we might have already closed some tabs. \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"close all the tabs to the left\" meaning from the current left boundary (a) to the left of the cursor (i-1). But note: if we are at i, then the operation will close [a, i-1]. We want to leave [l, r]. So we require that the set [a, i-1] does not include any tab from [l, r]. Therefore, we must have i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. However, if i < l, then we close from a to i-1 (which is safe because i-1 < l). But if i = l, then we close from a to l-1 (which is exactly the left part we want to remove). So we can close the left part from a tab i such that i >= l (actually, we can use i=l to close the left part).\n\n          Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a tab i such that i+1 > r (but wait, the operation closes from i+1 to b). We want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close any tab below r. Therefore, we require that the operation doesn't close any tab from [l, r]. So we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r? Actually, if i = r, then we close [r+1, b] which is exactly the right part we want to remove. So we can use i=r.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions for closing one side are:\n            - Left: we can close the left part (if there is any) if we are at a tab i >= l (and in fact, to avoid closing the desired part, we must have i-1 < l, but note: if i>=l, then i-1 might be >= l or not. Actually, if we are at i=l, then we close [a, l-1] which is safe. If we are at i=l+1, then we close [a, l] which would remove the desired tab l. So we must be at a tab i such that i <= l? But wait, we want to leave l. So we must not close l. Therefore, the operation \"close left\" requires that we are at a tab i such that i-1 < l. In other words, i <= l. However, note that if we are at i=l, then we are closing [a, l-1] (which is okay). So we can be at i=l.\n\n          Similarly, for the right: we must be at i>=r? Actually, to avoid closing any desired tab, we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i>=r. But if we are at i=r, then we close [r+1, b] (safe). If we are at i=r-1, then we close [r, b] (which would remove r, which we don't want). So we must be at i>=r.\n\n          However, note that we can also do multiple closures? But the problem says we want to leave exactly [l, r]. So we can only close the left part once and the right part once.\n\n          Now, how to plan the moves?\n\n          We have two independent closures: left and right. The challenge is to arrange the moves (including the necessary movements to get to the closure positions) in an optimal way.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Let left_side = (l-1) exists (i.e., l>1) and right_side = (n-r) exists (i.e., r<n).\n\n          We have two strategies:\n\n          Strategy 1: Do left closure first, then right closure.\n\n            Step 1: Move the cursor from initial 'pos' to 'l' (to perform the left closure). But wait, we can do better: we might not need to go all the way to l if we can use a closer point? Actually, we must be at a position <= l to close the left. The minimal movement to get to a valid position for left closure is to get to l (since we can also stop at any tab from 1 to l, but we want to minimize the total seconds). However, note that after closing the left, the boundaries change and the movement for the right closure might be affected.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require us to keep the cursor at a particular place at the end. We just need to leave the tabs [l, r] and the cursor can be anywhere. But the operations are defined on the current boundaries.\n\n          Let's break down:\n\n          Option 1: Close left first (if needed) then right (if needed).\n\n          Steps for left closure (if l>1):\n            We must move to a tab i (with i<=l) to close the left. The best tab to be at for closing the left is l (because then we don't have to move further for the next closure if we are already at the boundary). But actually, we can choose to close the left from any tab i (as long as i<=l). However, we want to minimize the total moves.\n\n          Similarly, for the right closure (if r<n), we must be at a tab i (with i>=r) to close the right.\n\n          The total seconds for Option 1 (left then right):\n\n            Step 1: Move from 'pos' to the closure position for left. But note: we can break the movement into two parts? Actually, we are going to do two closures, and we can choose the order of movements arbitrarily (we can move to the left closure, then move again to the right closure). However, we must account for the boundaries changing.\n\n          But wait: when we close the left, the left boundary changes and the available tabs are now from l to n (if we haven't closed the right). However, the right closure requires being at a tab >= r. After closing the left, the tab positions are the same (the tabs from l to n remain) but the left boundary is now l. The cursor is at l (if we moved there) or somewhere else? Actually, we don't necessarily have to go to l. We could go to any tab from 1 to l. However, to minimize movement, we would go to the closest tab that allows the next closure.\n\n          However, note: we can also consider doing both closures from the same movement? Or perhaps we can move to the middle of the segment.\n\n          Alternate Insight:\n\n          We have two independent actions: closing the left and closing the right. The closing operations require being at a specific side (left closure requires being at or left of l, right closure requires being at or right of r). We can do:\n\n          Case 1: Both closures are needed (l>1 and r<n).\n            Possibilities:\n              a) Move from 'pos' to l (for left closure), then from l to r (for right closure).\n                 Time: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 (two closure operations)\n\n              b) Move from 'pos' to r (for right closure), then from r to l (for left closure).\n                 Time: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n              c) Move to a common point? Actually, we can consider moving to the intersection of the two required areas. But note: the left closure requires being at a tab <= l, and the right closure requires being at a tab >= r. Since l <= r (given), these two sets are disjoint unless l == r. So if l < r, then we must pass through the entire segment [l, r] to go from a point <= l to a point >= r? Actually, we can do:\n\n                 Option: First move to the left boundary (l) and then to the right boundary (r). Or first move to the right boundary (r) and then to the left boundary (l). But note: the movement from l to r is |r-l|, and from r to l is the same.\n\n                 However, what if we do:\n\n                    Option d: Move from 'pos' to the left boundary (l) and then do the left closure, then move from l to the right boundary (r) and do the right closure.\n\n                 This is the same as a).\n\n                 Option e: What if we do the left closure from a point between the initial position and l? Actually, we must be at a tab <= l to close the left, and we can be at any tab <= l. Similarly for the right.\n\n                 But note: we are allowed to do the closure operations at any time, and we can interleave movements and closures arbitrarily. However, the problem is asking for the minimum seconds.\n\n          Another possibility: we might not need to move the cursor to the very ends if we can use the same path for both closures. However, let's analyze:\n\n          We must eventually be at a tab <= l to close the left, and at a tab >= r to close the right.\n\n          The minimal total movement is the sum of the distances we need to cover for both closures, plus the two closure operations (each taking 1 second).\n\n          But note: we start at 'pos'. We have two tasks:\n\n            Task 1: Get to a tab i1 such that i1 <= l (to close the left).\n            Task 2: Get to a tab i2 such that i2 >= r (to close the right).\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Option A: Go to l first, then from l to r.\n\n            Option B: Go to r first, then from r to l.\n\n          But what if we do:\n\n            Option C: We can go to a tab that is both <= l and >= r? Only possible if l>=r, but by the problem l<=r. So this is only possible if l==r, then we can do both closures from the same tab (the tab l=r). Then the total time is |pos - l| (to get to l) and then 2 (for the two closures). But note: if l==r, then the segment is a single tab. Then we must close both sides (if they exist). So if l==r and l>1 and r<n, then we need to go to l (which is the same as r) and then do two closures. However, if l==r and one side doesn't exist, then we don't need to do that side.\n\n          Actually, the problem states: we want to leave the tabs from l to r. If l==r, then we leave only one tab. Then we must close the left (if l>1) and the right (if r<n). But note: if l==r, then l>1 and r<n might both be true (if 1<l<n). Then we must do two closures.\n\n          So the algorithm:\n\n          Let left_required = (l > 1)\n          Let right_required = (r < n)\n\n          Case 1: Neither required -> 0 seconds.\n\n          Case 2: Only left_required -> then we must move the cursor to a tab <= l (specifically, we can use the tab l) and then close the left. But note: we don't need to do the right closure because the right part is already included (since r=n, so no right to close). However, we must make sure that we don't close the right part by accident? Actually, we are only closing the left. The operation \"close left\" doesn't affect the right. So we can simply move to l and close the left.\n\n          Similarly, if only right_required, then move to r and close the right.\n\n          Case 3: Both required.\n\n          Then we have two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: Move to l, then to r.\n                Time: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2\n\n            Possibility 2: Move to r, then to l.\n                Time: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n            But note: |l - r| = |r - l|, so the two possibilities are symmetric. However, we must consider that the initial position might be between l and r, or outside.\n\n          However, wait: what if we can do the closures without going to the very ends? For example, if the initial position is already in [l, r], then we might not need to move as far. But note: to close the left, we must be at a tab <= l. Similarly for the right. So we must leave the segment [l, r] to perform the closure? Actually, no: we can be inside [l, r] and then move to the boundary. But note: the closure operation does not require being exactly at the boundary, but we must be at a tab that is <= l (for left) or >= r (for right). So if we are at a tab i in [l, r] and we wish to close the left, we must move to a tab <= l. The minimal movement for that is to move left until we hit l (if we are at i, then we move i-l steps to the left). Similarly for the right.\n\n          But note: we have two closures. We can interleave them? Actually, we can do:\n\n            Example: Start at a position p in [l, r]. We can:\n\n            Option: \n              Step 1: Move from p to l (if we do left closure first) -> then we are at l, then close left (now the left is closed, and the boundaries are [l, n]).\n              Step 2: Then we must move from l to r (which is |r-l| steps) and then close the right.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              Step 1: Move from p to r (if we do right closure first) -> then we are at r, then close right (now the right is closed, and the boundaries are [1, r]).\n              Step 2: Then we must move from r to l (which is |r-l| steps) and then close the left.\n\n            But wait: is there a better way? Consider:\n\n              We can move from p to a point that is <= l and >= r? Only if l>=r, which isn't the case. So we have to leave the segment [l, r] to do one of the closures.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require the cursor to stay in the segment [l, r] during the process. The segment [l, r] is the desired final state, but during the process, we can have more tabs (until we close them). And the movement is defined on the current boundaries (which change as we close tabs). But the operation definitions use the current boundaries (a and b) and the cursor movement is limited by these boundaries.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to move within the current boundaries. Initially, the boundaries are [1, n]. After closing the left, the boundaries become [l, n]. Then moving from l to r is allowed because r is still there and the boundaries now are [l, n] (so we can move from l to r without leaving the boundaries).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal time for both closures is the minimum of:\n\n            time1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2\n            time2 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n          But note: |l - r| = |r - l|, so time1 = time2. Then why the example input \"6 3 2 4\" gives 5?\n\n          Let me compute with the example:\n\n            n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n            Both closures are required.\n\n            time1 = |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n            time2 = |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n          So that matches.\n\n          However, consider another example: \"6 3 1 3\"\n\n          Input: ['6 3 1 3'] -> Output: 1\n\n          Here: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n          Left closure is not needed (l==1) but right closure is needed (r=3 < n=6). So we are in the case of only right_required.\n\n          Then we must move from 3 to 3 (already at 3) and then close the right. So time = 0 (move) + 1 (closure) = 1.\n\n          But wait, according to our breakdown:\n\n            left_required = (l>1) -> 1>1? False.\n            right_required = (r<n) -> 3<6 -> True.\n\n          Then we do: move to r (which is 3) -> distance |3-3|=0, then close the right: 1 second. Total 1.\n\n          Now, consider \"5 2 1 5\": \n            Input: ['5 2 1 5'] -> Output: 0\n\n          Here: l=1, r=5, so no closure needed. 0.\n\n          But wait: what if the initial position is outside [l, r]? \n\n          Example: n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=6.\n\n          Then we need to close the left (because l=5, so left_required=True) and the right (because r=6, so right_required=True). \n\n          Then we have two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: Move from 1 to 5 (distance 4), then from 5 to 6 (distance 1) -> total movement 5, plus 2 closures -> 7.\n\n            Possibility 2: Move from 1 to 6 (distance 5), then from 6 to 5 (distance 1) -> total movement 6, plus 2 closures -> 8.\n\n          But wait, we can also consider: \n\n          After the first closure, the boundaries change. However, note that the closure operations do not change the relative positions of the remaining tabs. They just remove the ones to the left or right. So the movement cost is still the absolute difference in the original numbering? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: the cursor moves from i to max(i-1, a) or min(i+1, b). But note: when we close the left, the left boundary becomes l (which is 5) and the right remains 10. Then from 5, we move to 6: the movement is 1 (because 6-5=1). \n\n          However, if we close the right first, then the right boundary becomes 6, and then from 6 we move to 5: the movement is 1 (because 6-5=1, but wait: the boundaries change. But the problem does not say the tabs are renumbered. The tabs are fixed by their original indices. The operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" removes the tabs with indices from a to i-1. So the tab indices remain the same, but the boundaries (a and b) change.\n\n          Therefore, the movement is always based on the original tab indices. The cursor is always at a tab index (from 1 to n) and the boundaries a and b are the minimum and maximum of the remaining tabs.\n\n          But note: the movement is defined as:\n            - From i, we can go to max(i-1, a) and min(i+1, b). However, after closing, the boundaries change. But the tab indices are fixed. The movement is still along the fixed indices.\n\n          Example: Initially, we have tabs 1..10. We are at tab 1. We close the left from tab 5? Wait, we cannot close the left from tab 5 if we are at tab 1. We must first move to a tab <=5. \n\n          So the movement is independent of the closure in terms of index differences, because the closure doesn't change the index of the remaining tabs.\n\n          Therefore, the distance between two tabs is always the absolute difference in their indices.\n\n          However, there is a catch: the closure operation changes the boundaries, but the tab indices remain the same. So the movement from a tab i to a tab j is |i-j|, regardless of the boundaries (because we can always move through the remaining tabs? Actually, no: the boundaries limit the movement. For example, if we have closed the left part, then the left boundary is l, so we cannot move beyond l to the left. But note: we are only concerned with the minimal seconds.\n\n          The problem is asking for the minimal number of seconds. The movements are defined as one second per adjacent move (if we move one tab). So the minimal number of moves to go from i to j is |i-j|, provided that we are allowed to traverse the entire range? But wait, if we close the left, then the left boundary is set to l, so we cannot move beyond l to the left. However, since we are going from a starting point (which might be to the left of l) to a point (like l) and then to the right, the boundaries don't block the movement because we are moving within the remaining tabs.\n\n          Actually, the movement is defined by the boundaries, but note: when we are moving, the boundaries are the current set of unclosed tabs. However, we are closing the tabs in two parts. But the movement is allowed to go from i to i±1 as long as the resulting tab is unclosed and within [a, b]. But in our strategy, we are closing the entire left part first, so when we are moving from the initial position to l, the entire left part is still there (except we haven't closed it yet). Actually, we are allowed to move freely until we close the left part.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)\". Initially, a=1, b=n. Then after we close the left, a becomes l. But during the movement to l, we haven't closed the left, so a is still 1. Then we close the left, and then the boundaries change. But the movement to l was done when the boundaries were [1, n] (because we haven't closed the left yet). So the movement is not restricted by the future closure.\n\n          Therefore, we can assume that the entire movement is done on the full set of tabs (until we do the closure) and the closure operation then restricts the boundaries.\n\n          So the calculation of the movement distance is always the absolute difference in the tab indices.\n\n          Conclusion:\n\n          We can solve the problem as follows:\n\n          Read n, pos, l, r.\n\n          left_required = (l > 1)\n          right_required = (r < n)\n\n          if not left_required and not right_required:\n              print(0)\n          elif left_required and right_required:\n              # We have to do both closures.\n              # We can choose to do left then right, or right then left.\n              # The minimal time is the minimum of:\n              #   Option 1: Go to l, then to r, then two closures (each 1 second)\n              #   Option 2: Go to r, then to l, then two closures.\n              # But note: the movement from l to r is |r-l| and from r to l is the same, so both options give the same total movement? \n              #   However, the starting point is 'pos'. So:\n              #   Option 1: |pos-l| + |l-r|\n              #   Option 2: |pos-r| + |r-l|\n              # And then add 2 for the closures.\n              time1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n              time2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n              # Since |l-r| = |r-l|, time1 == time2.\n              print(min(time1, time2))\n          elif left_required:\n              # Only left closure is needed.\n              # We must move from pos to a tab <= l (ideally to l, because then we can close the left).\n              # The minimal movement is |pos - l| (because we can move directly to l from pos, and then close the left).\n              time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n              print(time)\n          elif right_required:\n              # Only right closure is needed.\n              time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n              print(time)\n\n          But wait: is it always optimal to go to the boundary (l for left, r for right) for the closure? \n\n          Example: for left_required only, we must be at a tab <= l. The minimal movement to reach any tab <= l is to move to the closest tab that is <= l. However, note: we are allowed to stop at any tab <= l. The minimal distance to a tab <= l is min(|pos - i| for i in [1, l]). This is achieved by going to the nearest tab that is <= l. \n\n          However, the minimal distance to a tab <= l is:\n\n            If pos <= l: then we don't need to move (we are already at a tab <= l) -> but wait, we are at pos (which is <= l) and we can close the left from there. Then the time is 0 (movement) + 1 (closure) = 1.\n\n            But note: the condition for left_required is (l>1). We are at a tab <= l (which is pos) and we can close the left. However, we must check: if we are at a tab i (<=l) then the operation \"close left\" will close [a, i-1]. We want to leave [l, ...] (at least l). But if i < l, then i-1 < l-1, so we close from a to i-1, which doesn't include l (because i-1 < l). But if i==l, then we close [a, l-1] (which is safe). \n\n          However, if we are at a tab i (<=l) and i != l, then we can still close the left. The operation doesn't require being at l. So we can close the left from any tab i (<=l). Therefore, the minimal movement is the distance from pos to the largest tab <= l (which is l) is |pos-l|. But wait: if we are at a tab i < l, we can close the left without moving to l. Then the movement is 0 if pos<=l? Actually, no: we are at pos (which is <=l) so we don't need to move. Then the time is 0 (for movement) + 1 (for closure) = 1.\n\n          However, wait: we started at pos, which is <=l, so we don't need to move. But what if we are at a tab that is greater than l? Then we must move to a tab <= l. The minimal movement is |pos-l| (if we go to l, but maybe we can go to a tab closer to pos that is <= l? Actually, the closest tab to pos that is <= l is:\n\n            If pos <= l, then we are already there (so movement 0).\n            If pos > l, then we must move to l (the boundary) because any tab to the left of l is closer to pos? Actually, the minimal distance from pos to a tab <= l is (pos - l) if we move left, but if we are at pos and pos>l, then the minimal movement is (pos - l) to get to l (if we move left). But note: we can also stop at any tab from 1 to l. The minimal distance is the distance from pos to l (if we move left) or to a tab that is the largest tab <= pos? Actually, the minimal distance is the distance from pos to the largest tab <= l (which is l) because moving left from pos (if pos>l) we must go to l (if we don't overshoot). But wait, we can stop at any tab <= l. The minimal distance is the distance from pos to the nearest tab that is <= l. Since the tabs are consecutive, the minimal distance is:\n\n              If pos >= l, then we can stop at l (distance = pos-l). But wait, if pos is between l and r? Actually, we are in the case of left_required only (meaning we don't need to close the right) and we are allowed to be anywhere as long as we leave [l, r] (so we must close the left). The minimal movement is the distance from pos to l (if we are to the right of l) or 0 (if we are to the left of l). However, note: if we are at a tab i (<=l) we can close the left. But if we are at a tab i (<=l) and we are not at l, we can still close the left. But we don't need to move to l if we are already at a tab <= l. The minimal movement is 0 if pos<=l, and if pos>l then we must move to a tab <= l (the closest one is l, so distance = pos-l).\n\n          However, wait: if we are at a tab i (<=l) we can close the left. But if we are at a tab i (<=l) and i != l, is that acceptable? Yes. So the minimal movement is:\n\n            If pos <= l: 0\n            Else: pos - l\n\n          Then total time = movement + 1 (for the closure)\n\n          Similarly, for the right_required only:\n\n            If pos >= r: 0\n            Else: r - pos\n\n          Then total time = movement + 1.\n\n          But wait: the example \"6 3 1 3\": \n            n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3 -> only right_required (r=3 < n=6). \n            Condition: pos=3, r=3 -> so pos>=r -> movement=0, then time=1. Correct.\n\n          Now, consider an example for left_required only: \n            Input: \"5 2 2 5\" -> n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=5. \n            Here, left_required: l=2>1 -> True; right_required: r=5==n -> False.\n\n            Then time = 0 (because pos=2<=l=2) + 1 = 1.\n\n          But what if we are at a tab that is less than l? \n            Example: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=5 -> left_required=True, right_required=False.\n            Then movement: since pos=1<=2, movement=0, then time=1.\n\n          However, wait: if we are at tab1 and we close the left, then we close [a,0] which is nothing (because a is 1, and 1-1=0 which is below the left boundary). Actually, the operation \"close left\" when the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the required operations and movements efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba can move the cursor left or right one tab per second.\n   - She can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second each.\n   - The goal is to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive, minimizing the time taken.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed (time = 0).\n   - If only the left side needs closing (i.e., `l > 1`), move the cursor to `l` (if not already there) and perform the left closure.\n   - If only the right side needs closing (i.e., `r < n`), move the cursor to `r` (if not already there) and perform the right closure.\n   - If both sides need closing, move the cursor to either `l` first then to `r`, or vice versa, and perform both closures. The optimal path is determined by the minimal movement distance.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - For each scenario (no closure needed, only left closure, only right closure, or both closures), calculate the minimal movement distance and add the closure operations' time (1 second per closure).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, resulting in constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    left_required = (l_val > 1)\n    right_required = (r_val < n)\n    \n    if not left_required and not right_required:\n        print(0)\n    elif left_required and right_required:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif left_required:\n        if pos <= l_val:\n            movement = 0\n        else:\n            movement = pos - l_val\n        print(movement + 1)\n    elif right_required:\n        if pos >= r_val:\n            movement = 0\n        else:\n            movement = r_val - pos\n        print(movement + 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input consists of four integers: `n` (number of tabs), `pos` (initial cursor position), `l_val` (left boundary of the desired segment), and `r_val` (right boundary).\n- **Conditions Check**: \n  - If neither side needs closing (`l_val == 1` and `r_val == n`), output 0.\n  - If both sides need closing, compute the minimal time by considering two paths: moving to `l_val` first then to `r_val`, or vice versa. Each path includes the movement distance and two closure operations (each taking 1 second).\n  - If only the left side needs closing, move the cursor to `l_val` (if necessary) and close the left tabs (1 second).\n  - If only the right side needs closing, move the cursor to `r_val` (if necessary) and close the right tabs (1 second).\n- **Output**: The minimal time is printed based on the above conditions.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional logic to determine the optimal sequence of operations.",
