Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players, each making exactly n moves. In each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). Then that digit is erased from A.\n\n We want to assign each of the 2n moves to either Homer or Marge (so n moves for each) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 + the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", meaning the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But note: The assignment of moves to players can be arbitrary as long as each player makes n moves. However, the catch is that the digits are taken in order from left to right.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the entire sequence of 2n digits be d0, d1, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n In the game, the players will take turns? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of turns. It only says \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move\". So we can choose the order arbitrarily as long as each player makes exactly n moves.\n\n However, the process is sequential: we remove the leftmost digit at each step and assign it to one of the players.\n\n The total prize is the sum of the two numbers built by the players.\n\n How to think?\n\n Let the entire sequence be split into two sequences: \n   For Homer: we have a subsequence of n digits (in the order they appear in A) and similarly for Marge.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from the front. So the assignment must be such that the digits assigned to a player must appear consecutively? Not necessarily: the moves are interleaved arbitrarily. However, the digits are removed from the left, so the assignment must form two subsequences that are interleaved.\n\n Actually, the assignment is just partitioning the 2n digits into two sets of n digits, and then the two numbers are built by taking the digits in the order they were removed (which is the same as the original order).\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n   Partition the 2n-digit string into two strings of length n (each) and maximize the numerical value of the two numbers (the sum).\n\n However, note: the two numbers are built from the digits in the order they appear. But the catch is that the digits are removed from the front. So the two numbers are built by interleaving the digits arbitrarily? Actually, the two numbers are built by the digits that were taken at the times when it was their turn.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n   Possibilities:\n     Option 1: HHMM -> Homer takes '1' and then '3', so S1 = 13; Marge takes '2' and then '4', so S2 = 24. Total = 13+24 = 37.\n     Option 2: HMMH -> Homer takes '1' and then '4'; Marge takes '2' and then '3'. Then S1=14, S2=23 -> 37 again.\n     Option 3: HMHM -> Homer: '1','3' -> 13; Marge: '2','4' -> 24 -> 37.\n     Option 4: MHHM -> Marge takes first: '1' then third: '3' -> so Marge's number is 13, Homer takes second and fourth: 24 -> same.\n\n But wait, the example output for input ['2\\n1234'] is 'HHMM'. And for ['2\\n9911'] is 'HMHM'.\n\n Why is the example input '9911' giving 'HMHM'?\n\n Let's consider n=2, A=\"9911\":\n   Possibilities:\n\n   Option: HHMM: \n        Homer: first '9' and third '1' -> 91\n        Marge: second '9' and fourth '1' -> 91 -> total 182\n\n   Option: HMMH:\n        Homer: first '9' and fourth '1' -> 91\n        Marge: second '9' and third '1' -> 91 -> total 182\n\n   Option: HMHM:\n        Homer: first '9' and second '9' -> 99\n        Marge: third '1' and fourth '1' -> 11 -> total 110\n\n   Option: MHHM:\n        Homer: second '9' and fourth '1' -> 91\n        Marge: first '9' and third '1' -> 91 -> total 182\n\n So the best total is 182. And the example output is 'HMHM'? But wait, 'HMHM' gives 99+11=110 which is worse.\n\n However, note: the example output is 'HMHM' for input \"9911\". But wait, let me check the example again: \n\n   Input: \n        2\n        9911\n\n   Output: \n        'HMHM'\n\n But according to our calculation, 'HMHM' gives 99+11=110, while other options give 91+91=182. So why is the example output 'HMHM'? \n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \"Output the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize.\"\n\n So we must output a sequence that achieves the maximum total prize. But note: there might be multiple ways to achieve the maximum. In this case, the maximum total prize is 182, achieved by several sequences (like HHMM, HMMH, MHHM, etc.) but not by HMHM.\n\n Wait, the example output is provided as:\n\n      Input: ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n      Output: ['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\n This implies that for the first example, the answer is 'HHMM', and for the second example, the answer is 'HMHM'. But our calculation shows that for the second example, 'HMHM' does not yield the maximum total prize.\n\n There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n Let me re-read the problem: \n   \"In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.\"\n\n And we are to maximize the total prize, which is S1 + S2.\n\n However, note: the example outputs are provided as strings of moves. The example input \"9911\" should output \"HMHM\", but our calculation for \"HMHM\" gives 99+11=110, and for \"HHMM\" gives 91+91=182.\n\n But wait, what if the problem considers the two players as distinct? Actually, the problem says: \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\". The total is S1+S2.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the moves are taken by alternating players. The problem says \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move\". So the moves can be interleaved arbitrarily.\n\n But the example output for \"9911\" is \"HMHM\", which is an interleaving that does not yield the maximum total. \n\n Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the building of the numbers.\n\n Let me simulate the example \"9911\" with the sequence \"HMHM\":\n\n   Initially: A = \"9911\", S1 = \"\", S2 = \"\"\n   First move (H): take the leftmost digit '9', append to S1 -> S1=\"9\", A becomes \"911\"\n   Second move (M): take the leftmost digit '9', append to S2 -> S2=\"9\", A becomes \"11\"\n   Third move (H): take the leftmost digit '1', append to S1 -> S1=\"91\", A becomes \"1\"\n   Fourth move (M): take the leftmost digit '1', append to S2 -> S2=\"91\"\n\n   So the numbers are S1=91, S2=91, and total 182.\n\n Ah! I see, I made a mistake: in the option HMHM, the moves are assigned as:\n\n   Move1: H -> take the first '9'\n   Move2: M -> take the second '9'\n   Move3: H -> take the third '1'\n   Move4: M -> take the fourth '1'\n\n Then the numbers are:\n   Homer: first digit '9' and third digit '1' -> so the number is built as \"9\" then \"1\" -> 91\n   Marge: second digit '9' and fourth digit '1' -> so the number is built as \"9\" then \"1\" -> 91\n\n So the total is 91+91=182.\n\n Similarly, in the first example \"1234\" with \"HHMM\":\n\n   Move1: H -> take '1', S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n   Move2: H -> take '2', S1=\"12\", A=\"34\"\n   Move3: M -> take '3', S2=\"3\", A=\"4\"\n   Move4: M -> take '4', S2=\"34\"\n\n   Then S1=12, S2=34 -> 46.\n\n But wait, the example says the output for \"1234\" is \"HHMM\" and the example output for \"9911\" is \"HMHM\", and both examples are correct.\n\n However, note: the example input \"1234\" was given and the output was \"HHMM\", and the example input \"9911\" was given and the output was \"HMHM\".\n\n But wait, the example output for \"1234\" is \"HHMM\", but the example output for \"9911\" is \"HMHM\". \n\n Now, the problem: how to compute the maximum total prize and a corresponding move sequence.\n\n We need to assign each of the 2n digits to either Homer or Marge, with exactly n for each, and the assignment must be done in increasing index order (since the digits are taken from left to right). Then the number for Homer is the concatenation of the digits assigned to Homer in the order of occurrence, and similarly for Marge.\n\n We wish to maximize: (number formed by Homer's digits) + (number formed by Marge's digits)\n\n Note: The numerical value of a number is affected by the position of the digits. Since the digits are taken in order, the earlier a digit appears, the more significant its place.\n\n Let the entire sequence be d0, d1, ... d_{2n-1}. Then the final number for Homer is:\n\n   Let the indices assigned to Homer be i1 < i2 < ... < in (where i1 is the first move, then second, etc.). Then the value is:\n\n      d[i1] * (10^(n-1)) + d[i2] * (10^(n-2)) + ... + d[in] * (10^0)\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n Therefore, the entire assignment is a partition of the 2n indices into two sets of size n, and the value of the two numbers is fixed by the positions.\n\n We wish to maximize: \n   Sum_Homer + Sum_Marge\n\n Since the two numbers are independent, we can think of it as:\n\n   Let F(S) = the number built by the digits at positions in set S (with the order of appearance, so the digit at the smallest index is the most significant).\n\n Then we wish to maximize F(S1) + F(S2) over all partitions {S1, S2} of {0,...,2n-1} with |S1|=|S2|=n.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Note: n is up to 18, so 2n is up to 36. The total number of partitions is C(36,18) which is about 9e9, too many to iterate.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can use dynamic programming. We traverse the digits from left to right (index 0 to 2n-1). At each step, we decide whether to assign the current digit to Homer or Marge, but we must assign exactly n to each.\n\n However, the value of the number is determined by the entire sequence of digits assigned to each player. Specifically, the first time a player gets a digit, it goes in the most significant position, the next in the next, etc.\n\n But note: the assignment must be in increasing index order. So the digits are appended in the order of removal.\n\n Therefore, for a player, the digits they get are in increasing index order, and the number they form is the concatenation of these digits (so the leftmost digit they got is the most significant).\n\n We can use DP with state (i, j) where i is the number of digits assigned to Homer so far, j the number assigned to Marge, and we are at the k-th digit (k = i+j). However, we also need to know the exact digits that have been assigned to each so far? That would be too expensive.\n\n But note: the value of the numbers depends on the entire sequence. However, we can use DP that considers the entire assignment and then reconstruct the sequence.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP that builds the two numbers from left to right (but we don't know the entire number until the end). However, the numbers are built by appending digits (so the next digit is appended at the end, meaning it is the least significant digit so far). But wait: the assignment is done in order, and the digit assigned at step t is appended to the current number. However, the next digit assigned to the same player will be appended to the right (so the entire number is built from left to right, and the first digit is the most significant).\n\n Actually, the value of a player's number is:\n\n   Let the digits assigned to Homer (in the order of assignment) be d_i1, d_i2, ..., d_in. Then the number is:\n\n        d_i1 * (10^(n-1)) + d_i2 * (10^(n-2)) + ... + d_in * (10^0)\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n We can break down the total sum:\n\n   Total = (d_i1 * 10^(n-1) + d_i2 * 10^(n-2) + ... ) + (d_j1 * 10^(n-1) + d_j2 * 10^(n-2) + ... )\n\n But note: the exponents depend on the order in which the digits are assigned to the player. The first digit assigned (at any time) is the most significant (multiplied by 10^(n-1)), the second is 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n However, the assignment to a player is in the order of the original indices. But note: the same player might get non-consecutive digits. The key point: the digit assigned at the earliest time to a player is the most significant.\n\n So the entire value of Homer's number is:\n\n   Sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [ (digit at the (k+1)-th assignment of Homer) * (10^(n-1-k)) ]\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n We can design a DP that goes digit by digit (from left to right) and keeps track of:\n\n   - How many digits have been assigned to each player (so we know we stop at 2n)\n   - For each player, the current length of the number (which is the count of digits assigned) and the current value? But the value would be too big (up to 10^(36) states) and n is 18, so the value is up to 10^18 per number, which is too big for DP.\n\n Another idea: since the digits are taken in order, the assignment of a digit to a player will be placed at a specific power of 10. The first digit assigned to a player will be multiplied by 10^(n-1) (if we assign n digits, the first is the most significant). But note: the assignment order for a player is the order in which the digits appear in A.\n\n However, we can precompute the contribution of a digit at a particular position (its index) if it is assigned to a player. But the exponent depends on the time the player gets that digit relative to the other digits they get.\n\n Specifically, if a player gets k digits so far, then the next digit they get will be the (k+1)-th digit (from the start of the game) and will be placed at 10^(n - (k+1)) (because the first digit they got was at 10^(n-1), the second at 10^(n-2), ... and the last at 10^0).\n\n But note: the entire assignment for a player is fixed in the order of appearance, so the first digit (lowest index) assigned to a player is always the most significant, regardless of when in the game it was taken.\n\n Therefore, the value contributed by a digit d at index i (if assigned to a player) is:\n\n   d * (10^(n - (position in the player's sequence)))\n\n However, we don't know the position in the player's sequence until we know how many digits the player has already taken.\n\n We can do DP with state (i, a, b) where:\n   i: current index (from 0 to 2n)\n   a: number of digits assigned to Homer so far (0 <= a <= n)\n   b: number of digits assigned to Marge so far (0 <= b <= n)\n\n But then we have to remember the entire sequence of digits for each player? No, we cannot because the digit values matter and the power depends on the order.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the digit at index i (which is d_i) if assigned to Homer, will be placed in the (a+1)-th position of Homer's number (if a is the current count for Homer). Then its multiplier is 10^(n - (a+1)). Similarly for Marge.\n\n Then the total value at state (i, a, b) is:\n\n   value = (value from Homer's digits) + (value from Marge's digits)\n\n But the value from Homer's digits is the sum_{j=0}^{a-1} (digit at the j-th assignment to Homer) * (10^(n-1-j))\n\n However, we don't store the entire sequence of digits, but we can compute the value incrementally.\n\n We can do:\n\n   dp[i][a][b] = the maximum total value we can get from the digits from i to the end, given that Homer has a digits and Marge has b digits so far.\n\n Then, the recurrence:\n\n   dp[i][a][b] = max {\n        (if we assign digit i to Homer and a < n) then:\n            (digit_i * (10^(n - (a))) ) + dp[i+1][a+1][b]   [Note: the next assignment for Homer will be the (a+1)-th, so this digit is at exponent (n - (a)) because the exponents go from n-1 down to 0. But wait: the first digit (a=0) goes to 10^(n-1). Here, if we have already assigned a digits, then the next one is the (a+1)-th, so exponent = n - (a+1) ? \n\n        Correction: the exponent for the (k+1)-th digit (0-indexed k) is 10^(n-1-k). So for the a-th digit (if we start counting from 0) then exponent = 10^(n-1-a). But note: we are going to assign the digit at index i to be the (a+1)-th digit for Homer. Then the exponent is 10^(n-1 - a) (because a is the current count, and we are going to add one, so the new digit is the (a+1)-th, so exponent = 10^(n-1 - (a))? Actually, no: the first digit (a=0) is the most significant: exponent 10^(n-1). The second (a=1) is 10^(n-2). \n\n        So the exponent for the (a+1)-th digit (when we are about to assign the (a+1)-th) is 10^(n-1 - a). \n\n        But wait: if we have already assigned a digits, then the next one is the (a+1)-th, and the exponent for that one is 10^(n-1 - a). \n\n        However, in the state (i, a, b), we have processed i digits (from 0 to i-1). Now we are at digit i. If we assign it to Homer, then we are going to have a+1 digits for Homer, and the digit is the (a+1)-th digit for Homer. The value added by this digit is d_i * (10^(n-1 - a)).\n\n        Similarly, if we assign to Marge, then the value added is d_i * (10^(n-1 - b)).\n\n   }\n\n However, note: the entire number for a player is built by the digits in the order they are taken. The digit at index i is taken at time i (the i-th move). Then the same player might take more digits later, but the relative order of the digits in the player's number is fixed by the original order.\n\n But here is the catch: the exponent for a digit in a player's number depends on the total number of digits the player will eventually get? \n\n Actually, no: the exponent for a digit is determined by the order in which the player receives the digits. The first digit they get is the most significant (exponent 10^(n-1)), the second is 10^(n-2)), etc. However, we don't know the entire assignment until the end. \n\n But note: the assignment is fixed: the digits are taken in order. So the digit at index i will be the (k+1)-th digit for a player if that player has taken k digits before the one at index i.\n\n However, the DP state above does not account for the fact that the same player might take more digits after index i. The exponent for the digit at index i is fixed: it will be the (k+1)-th digit for the player, and k is the number of digits that player has taken from the beginning until index i (including this one). But wait, we are processing from left to right, and the digit at index i is the i-th digit. The player's digits must be in increasing index order, so the digits we've assigned to the player so far (at indices < i) are the ones that are already assigned and they are the first k digits for that player, and then the digit at i is the (k+1)-th.\n\n However, the entire number for the player is built from the entire set of digits. But we are building the number from left to right (most significant to least). The digit at index i is appended at the position corresponding to the (k+1)-th digit (if we are assigning it to a player that has k digits so far). But note: the rest of the digits (after i) that are assigned to the same player will be less significant than this one? \n\n Actually, yes: because the entire set of digits for the player is fixed, and the digit at index i is the (k+1)-th smallest index (in the entire sequence) that the player took. Then the rest of the digits (with larger indices) will be even smaller in significance.\n\n But wait: the entire number for the player is the concatenation of the digits in the order of the original indices. So the digit at index i (assigned to the player) will be at the position (k+1) from the left. Then, if the player gets more digits (say at indices j1, j2, ... all greater than i), then the digit at index i is still the (k+1)-th digit (so exponent 10^(n-1-k)), and the digits at j1, j2, etc. will be placed at exponents 10^(n-1 - (k+1)), 10^(n-1 - (k+2)), etc.\n\n However, note: the entire number for the player has exactly n digits, so the digit at index i is the (k+1)-th digit (so the exponent is 10^(n-1-k)) regardless of the subsequent assignments? \n\n But wait: what if the player has not been assigned n digits yet? Then the digit at index i is the (k+1)-th digit, but the total number of digits for the player will be n. Then the exponent for the digit at index i is 10^(n-1-k). However, if we assign more digits to the player after index i, then the digit at index i remains the (k+1)-th digit (so the same exponent). \n\n Therefore, the exponent for a digit assigned to a player is fixed by the time (index) at which it is assigned and the total number of digits the player will eventually get? Actually, no: the exponent is fixed by the order of the digits in the entire sequence. The first digit (lowest index) is the most significant (exponent 10^(n-1)), the second (next lowest index) is 10^(n-2)), etc. \n\n However, note: the entire sequence of digits assigned to a player is exactly the n digits that are assigned to them, and they are in increasing index order. So the digit at index i is the (k+1)-th smallest index among the digits assigned to the player. Then the exponent for that digit is 10^(n-1 - k). \n\n But k is the number of digits the player has taken from the entire sequence (which we don't know until the end). \n\n Therefore, we cannot compute the value of the digit at index i until we know the entire assignment.\n\n Alternative approach: we are allowed to output any sequence that achieves the maximum total prize.\n\n We can use DP that goes from left to right and assigns each digit to one of the players, but we need to account for the future contributions. \n\n We can precompute the base value of a digit at index i if it is assigned to a player that ends up having k digits (for k from 0 to n). But k is the total number of digits the player gets. The exponent for the digit at index i in that player's number is determined by the rank of i in the set of indices assigned to that player.\n\n Specifically, if a player is assigned a set S of n indices, then the value of the player's number is:\n\n        V(S) = sum_{j in S} (d_j * 10^(n-1 - r(j)))\n\n where r(j) is the rank of j in S (i.e., the number of indices in S that are less than j).\n\n Then the total value is V(S1) + V(S2), and S1 and S2 partition the set {0,...,2n-1}.\n\n We wish to maximize V(S1)+V(S2).\n\n How to compute without iterating over all subsets?\n\n We can use DP that goes over the indices and decides the assignment, and at the same time we know for each player the set of indices they have so far, but we don't know the entire set.\n\n However, note: the rank of an index j in the set S (for a player) is the number of indices in S that are less than j. And the exponent is 10^(n-1 - (# of elements in S that are less than j)).\n\n Then the contribution of digit j if assigned to a player is:\n\n        d_j * (10^(n-1 - (number of digits assigned to the same player from indices 0 to j-1))\n\n But wait, we are processing from left to right, so when we assign digit j, we know the number of digits the player has already taken (from indices < j). Then the exponent for digit j is 10^(n-1 - (current_count)).\n\n However, the total number of digits the player will have at the end is n, so the current_count is the number of digits the player has taken so far (from the beginning until j-1). But note: the digit j is being assigned now, so after assignment the count becomes current_count+1. But the exponent is based on the current_count (the previous ones) because the digit j is the (current_count+1)-th digit.\n\n So the value added by digit j if assigned to a player is:\n\n        d_j * (10^(n-1 - current_count))\n\n Then the entire value of the two numbers is the sum of these contributions.\n\n Then we can do:\n\n   dp[i][a][b] = the maximum total value we can get from the digits from i to the end, given that Homer has a digits and Marge has b digits so far (from the first i digits).\n\n   Then the state i (from 0 to 2n) and a from 0 to n, b from 0 to n.\n\n   The transition:\n\n        Option1: assign the i-th digit to Homer (if a < n)\n            Then the value from this digit is: int(A[i]) * (10^(n-1-a))   [because a is the current count for Homer (before adding this one), so the exponent is n-1 - a]\n            Then the state becomes dp[i+1][a+1][b]\n\n        Option2: assign to Marge (if b < n)\n            Then the value from this digit is: int(A[i]) * (10^(n-1-b))\n            Then state becomes dp[i+1][a][b+1]\n\n   Base case: when i == 2n, then we have assigned all digits and a must be n and b must be n, and the value is 0.\n\n   Then we can compute dp[0][0][0] as the maximum total value.\n\n   But note: the exponent depends on the current count (a for Homer, b for Marge) and the digit value.\n\n   However, the issue: the digit at index i is being assigned, and we are using the current count (a for Homer, b for Marge) to compute the exponent. This is correct because the exponent for the digit depends on the number of digits the player has already taken (from the beginning until now) and the total number of digits the player will have is n, so the digit is the (a+1)-th for Homer (and hence exponent 10^(n-1-a)).\n\n   But wait: what if the same player gets more digits after? Then the digit we are assigning now is still the (a+1)-th digit (because the subsequent digits are at higher indices, so they are less significant). \n\n   This DP is valid.\n\n   However, the state space is (2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1) = 37*19*19 ~ 13000 states, which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the exponentiation: we need powers of 10. We can precompute:\n\n        power10[k] = 10^(n-1-k) for k from 0 to n-1.\n\n        For a given state (i, a, b) and if we assign the digit to Homer, we use power10[n-1 - a] (if a < n). Similarly for Marge.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()   # string of 2n digits\n\n        Precompute powers: \n            power10 = [10**(n-1-k) for k in range(n)]   # for k from 0 to n-1: \n            But note: if we assign a digit and the player currently has a digits (so the next digit is the (a+1)-th, which is the (a)-th in zero-indexed count from the start) then the exponent is 10^(n-1-a). \n\n            However, if a==n, then we cannot assign, so we don't use.\n\n        Then, dp[i][a][b] = maximum total value from the remaining digits (from i to the end)\n\n        We can do bottom-up from i=2n down to 0, or top-down (memoization). Since 2n is 36 and n is 18, we can do bottom-up from i=2n to i=0.\n\n        Actually, we can do from i=0 to i=2n? But the DP state depends on the next state. We'll do from i=2n to i=0 (reverse) but the assignment is from left to right.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp[i][a][b] = maximum value from the suffix starting at index i, given that so far Homer has a digits and Marge has b digits.\n\n        Then:\n\n            dp[2n][n][n] = 0\n            For i from 2n-1 down to 0:\n                for a from 0 to n:\n                    for b from 0 to n:\n                        if a+b != i: continue   # actually, we are at the i-th digit, so a+b should be i? But wait, we are processing one digit at a time. Actually, we are at the i-th digit (0-indexed) and we have processed i digits (from 0 to i-1) so a+b = i.\n\n            Actually, we can index by i and the counts a and b must satisfy a+b = i.\n\n        Then the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][a][b] = max(\n                (if a < n) then (int(A_str[i]) * power10[n-1-a] + dp[i+1][a+1][b]),\n                (if b < n) then (int(A_str[i]) * power10[n-1-b] + dp[i+1][a][b+1])\n            )\n\n        But note: the exponent for the digit at index i (which is the i-th digit, so the next digit) is computed with the current counts (a and b) for the respective player.\n\n        However, we must consider that the digit at index i is the next one.\n\n        But wait: the entire set of digits is from index0 to index(2n-1). Our i runs from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n        We can structure the DP as:\n\n            dp[i][a][b] = maximum value from the digits [i:2n-1] (remaining) given that the counts are a and b (from the first i digits, so the remaining digits are 2n - i, and we require a+b = i, and the remaining moves: Homer needs n - a, Marge needs n - b, and (n-a)+(n-b)=2n-i, which matches).\n\n        Then the base case is at i=2n: dp[2n][n][n]=0.\n\n        Then we iterate i from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\n        However, note: the counts a and b must be at most n, and a+b = i.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let N = 2*n\n            dp = a 3D array of dimensions [N+1][n+1][n+1], initialize with -1 or a very small number.\n\n            But note: we are maximizing, so we can use -10**18.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                dp[i][a][b] = maximum total value from the substring starting at index i (so including i) to the end, given that we have a digits for Homer and b for Marge from the first i digits.\n\n            Actually, if we have processed i digits, then we are at the i-th digit (0-indexed) and we have a and b such that a+b=i.\n\n            Then the next digit is at index i.\n\n            We can define:\n\n                dp[i][a][b] = maximum total value from the digits [i..2n-1] given that we have already assigned a digits to Homer and b to Marge (so a+b = i)\n\n            Then the recurrence:\n\n                if a+b != i: skip.\n\n                Then, we are at digit i (the i-th digit in the entire string, so the digit is A_str[i])\n\n                Then:\n\n                    option1 = -10**18\n                    if a < n:\n                        # assign to Homer: the exponent is n-1 - a (because a is the current count for Homer, so the next digit is the (a+1)-th, so exponent is 10^(n-1-a))\n                        val_here = int(A_str[i]) * (10**(n-1-a))\n                        option1 = dp[i+1][a+1][b] + val_here\n\n                    option2 = -10**18\n                    if b < n:\n                        val_here = int(A_str[i]) * (10**(n-1-b))\n                        option2 = dp[i+1][a][b+1] + val_here\n\n                    dp[i][a][b] = max(option1, option2)\n\n            But wait: what if both are available? Then we take the max.\n\n            However, note: we must assign the digit to one of them.\n\n            But what if both are available and we don't know which one to choose? We are maximizing, so we choose the one that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number. The goal is to partition the digits into two sequences of equal length (each player takes exactly n digits) such that the sum of the numerical values of these sequences is maximized. The key insight is that the value of each digit in a player's sequence depends on its position, with earlier digits contributing more significantly due to their higher place values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning a sequence of 2n digits into two subsequences of length n each. The numerical value of each subsequence is determined by the digits' positions in the original sequence. The first digit taken by a player will be the most significant digit (multiplied by \\(10^{n-1}\\)), the next by \\(10^{n-2}\\), and so on.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][a][b]` represents the maximum value achievable from the remaining digits starting at index `i`, given that Homer has `a` digits and Marge has `b` digits so far (with `a + b = i`). The base case is when all digits are processed (`i = 2n`), where both players must have exactly `n` digits each.\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit at position `i`, we consider assigning it to either player (if they haven't reached their quota of `n` digits). The value contributed by the digit depends on the player's current count of digits (`a` or `b`), determining its place value (exponent of 10).\n4. **Result Extraction**: After filling the DP table, the solution traces back from `dp[0][0][0]` to determine the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    \n    dp = [[[-10**18] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    dp[total_digits][n][n] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits-1, -1, -1):\n        for a in range(n+1):\n            for b in range(n+1):\n                if a + b != i:\n                    continue\n                option1 = -10**18\n                option2 = -10**18\n                if a < n:\n                    exponent = n - 1 - a\n                    val_here = int(A_str[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                    next_val = dp[i+1][a+1][b]\n                    option1 = next_val + val_here\n                if b < n:\n                    exponent = n - 1 - b\n                    val_here = int(A_str[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                    next_val = dp[i+1][a][b+1]\n                    option2 = next_val + val_here\n                if option1 == -10**18 and option2 == -10**18:\n                    dp[i][a][b] = -10**18\n                else:\n                    dp[i][a][b] = max(option1, option2)\n    \n    path = []\n    i = 0\n    a = 0\n    b = 0\n    while i < total_digits:\n        if a < n and (b >= n or dp[i][a][b] == (dp[i+1][a+1][b] + int(A_str[i]) * (10**(n-1-a)))):\n            path.append('H')\n            a += 1\n        elif b < n:\n            path.append('M')\n            b += 1\n        i += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A_str` of 2n digits. The DP table is initialized to store the maximum value achievable from each state `(i, a, b)`.\n2. **Base Case**: When all digits are processed (`i = 2n`), the base case sets the value to 0 since no more digits are left.\n3. **DP Table Filling**: The DP table is filled in reverse order (from the end of the string to the start). For each digit, we compute the maximum value by considering both possible assignments (to Homer or Marge), using the current counts of digits each player has.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we trace back from the initial state `(0, 0, 0)` to determine the sequence of moves (H or M) that leads to the maximum total prize. The reconstruction checks which assignment (Homer or Marge) contributed to the optimal value at each step.\n5. **Output**: The sequence of moves (HMHM, HHMM, etc.) is printed, ensuring both players take exactly `n` digits each, maximizing their combined prize.",
