There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) or even try to use brute-force with state space reduction.\n However, note that the restrictions are given as intervals and we have to satisfy all. The profit is the sum of squares.\n\n Observation: Each house i can be built with height from 0 to h, but must satisfy all restrictions that cover it.\n\n We can think of the following:\n   Let A[1..n] be the heights of the houses.\n\n   For each restriction j (l_j, r_j, x_j), we require that for every i in [l_j, r_j], A[i] <= x_j.\n\n   But note: if a house is covered by multiple restrictions, then the height must be at most the minimum x_j of all restrictions covering that house.\n\n However, there is an additional twist: we can choose any height between 0 and h, but also the restrictions might conflict.\n\n Alternate approach: since n, m, h are small (<=50), we can consider iterating over the possible heights for each spot, but that would be 51^50 which is too big.\n\n Instead, we can use DP that goes from left to right and keeps track of the constraints that are still active.\n\n However, note: the constraints are given as intervals. We can precompute for each house i the minimum maximum height (i.e., the tightest restriction) that applies to it.\n\n But wait: the restrictions say \"the tallest house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\". This implies that if a house is in two intervals, then its height must be <= the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover it? Actually, no: because if one restriction requires a house to be at most 5 and another requires at most 3, then the house must be at most 3.\n\n However, note: the entire interval must be at most x_i. So for house i, the constraint is that the height must be <= min{ x_j | the restriction j covers i }.\n\n But wait: what if a restriction doesn't cover house i? Then no constraint from that restriction on house i.\n\n However, there's a catch: the restrictions are independent and must be satisfied simultaneously. But note that if a house is in two intervals, then the height must be at most the minimum x_j of the two restrictions (because if one restriction says <=5 and the other <=3, then the house must be <=3 to satisfy both). However, also note that the entire interval must be <= the restriction's x_i. So for each house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i from all restrictions that include house i.\n\n But wait: what if two restrictions overlap and impose different limits? Then the house must be <= the minimum limit.\n\n However, we must also consider that a restriction might not only constrain one house but the entire interval. But note: if we set each house independently to the minimum limit that covers it, then we must check that for each restriction j, the maximum house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. But if we set each house to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it, then for restriction j, the maximum house in [l_j, r_j] would be at most the minimum x_i that covers the entire interval? Not necessarily: because the minimum x_i for each house might be from a different restriction and if the restriction j has a larger x_j, then we might set the house to the minimum x_i which is from another restriction that is tighter (smaller) than x_j, so the condition for restriction j is automatically satisfied? \n\n Actually, no: because if we set each house i to the minimum x_j over all restrictions j that cover i, then for a restriction j, the tallest house in [l_j, r_j] is max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} A[i] = max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} (min_{k covering i} x_k). This might be greater than x_j? \n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n   Restriction2: [1,1] with x2=3\n\n   Then for house1: min(x1, x2) = 3; house2: min(x1) = 5.\n   Then the entire interval [1,2] (restriction1) must be <=5 -> house2 is 5 which is okay, but house1 is 3 which is <=5. However, the maximum in [1,2] is 5 which is <=5, so condition holds.\n\n   Now, if we have:\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n   Restriction2: [1,2] with x2=3\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height \\( h \\), but must comply with all restrictions that apply to its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each house's height is constrained by the tightest restriction covering it. Specifically, for each house at position \\( i \\), the maximum allowed height is the minimum \\( x_i \\) value from all restrictions that include this house in their interval \\([l_j, r_j]\\). This ensures all restrictions are satisfied.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the optimal height for each house while considering all constraints. The DP state tracks the current position and the constraints that must be satisfied up to that point. However, given the small constraints (n, m, h ≤ 50), we can also consider a simpler approach: for each house, determine the maximum allowed height based on all overlapping restrictions, then choose the height that maximizes the profit while respecting these constraints.\n3. **Optimization**: For each house, compute the minimum \\( x_i \\) from all restrictions covering it. Then, the optimal height for each house is the minimum of this computed value and \\( h \\). The total profit is the sum of the squares of these optimal heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n    \n    max_heights = [h] * (n + 1)\n    for l, r, x_val in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x_val < max_heights[i]:\n                max_heights[i] = x_val\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        height = max_heights[i]\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spots \\( n \\), the maximum height \\( h \\), the number of restrictions \\( m \\), and the restrictions themselves.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, we update the maximum allowed height for each house in the specified interval to the minimum \\( x_i \\) value from all restrictions covering that house.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: For each house, the optimal height is the minimum of the computed maximum allowed height and \\( h \\). The profit is then calculated as the sum of the squares of these optimal heights.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all zoning restrictions are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints directly to determine the optimal heights for each house. The solution is both straightforward and optimal given the problem constraints.",
