Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border (of nonzero length). \n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing one or more roads. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n We start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (but note: moving from one block to another requires crossing a contiguous segment of a road, i.e., one road at a time). However, if we cross multiple roads at an intersection, then we might be crossing several roads at once? But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (so they are separated by exactly one road). Therefore, to go from one block to another, we must cross one road (and we cannot cross two roads in one step).\n\n But note: the example input and output:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n   Output: 2\n\n Explanation: \n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y = 0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x = 0\n\n   These two roads divide the plane into 4 quadrants. The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant, and the university (-1,-1) is in the third quadrant.\n\n   To get from the first quadrant to the third quadrant, we have to cross two roads (the x-axis and the y-axis). However, note that we can only cross one road per step. So we need two steps.\n\n   But wait, how do we move? \n     Step1: from first quadrant to second quadrant (crossing the y-axis) OR to fourth quadrant (crossing the x-axis).\n     Step2: then from second quadrant to third (crossing the x-axis) OR from fourth quadrant to third (crossing the y-axis).\n\n   However, the problem does not require that we choose the shortest path in terms of Euclidean distance, but the minimum number of steps (road crossings). \n\n   Therefore, the answer is the number of distinct roads that separate the home and the university? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, consider: \n     Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and the university lie on different sides of a road if the sign of (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i) for the two points are different.\n\n   How many roads separate the home and the university? That is, for each road, check if (a_i*x1+b1*y1+c_i) and (a_i*x2+b2*y2+c_i) have opposite signs. Then the minimal number of steps is the number of such roads? But wait, the example above: \n\n        Road1 (y=0): \n            home: 1*0 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            university: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates\n\n        Road2 (x=0):\n            home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            university: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates\n\n        So both roads separate. Then according to this, the answer would be 2, which matches.\n\n   However, consider a different example:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n        Now, let's check the third road: x + y - 3 = 0.\n            home: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n            university: -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same side.\n\n        So only the first two roads separate. Then why is the answer 2? \n\n        Actually, note: the problem does not require that we count the number of separating roads as the answer. Because sometimes, even if a road does not separate, we might still have to cross it? \n\n   Let me think again: \n\n   We are allowed to move",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town. The blocks are defined by infinite line roads, and movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border of nonzero length. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university blocks lie on different sides of a road if the sign of the linear equation (ax + by + c) evaluated at these points differs. The minimal number of steps required to reach the university block from the home block is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. This is because each such road must be crossed exactly once during the journey, and each crossing corresponds to one step.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, this road contributes to the minimal number of steps. The total number of such roads gives the answer.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves checking each of the `n` roads once. Each check involves evaluating the linear equation for both the home and university coordinates, which is done in constant time. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 300.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the linear equation ax + by + c is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: If the evaluations at the two points have opposite signs, it means the road separates the home and university, and thus must be crossed once. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of separating roads is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university block from the home block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of the plane into regions. The solution is optimal and handles all edge cases within the given constraints.",
