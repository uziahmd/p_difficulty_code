Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters must be the same (and the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal has the same letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters? Let's read again: \n    - The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    - Then: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n   Input 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n   Output: 'NO'\n\n   Why? Because in the center (at row 3, column 3) we have 's' and the diagonals are supposed to be the same letter? Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter throughout.\n        Diagonal1: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) -> 'x','o','s','o','x' -> not the same.\n        Diagonal2: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) -> 'x','o','s','o','x' -> not the same.\n\n   But wait, the example input 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Output: YES.\n\n   In this case, the main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not all same? But wait, the problem says \"all letters are the same\" on the diagonal. However, in the example, the main diagonal has three letters: first is 'w', then 's', then 'w'. That's not the same.\n\n   Let me check the example again. Actually, the example output for the second one is 'YES'. \n\n   Let me re-read the problem: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   In the second example, the main diagonal has: \n        row0: index0 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 's'\n        row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n   So they are not the same. But wait, the example output is 'YES'.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the problem means that the two diagonals must have the same letter, but not necessarily the same letter as the other diagonal? Actually, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say the two diagonals have to be the same letter. But then the next condition: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\".\n\n   However, in the example, the two diagonals are:\n        Main diagonal: [w, s, w] -> not constant.\n        Other diagonal: [w, s, w] -> not constant.\n\n   This contradicts. \n\n   Let me check the example with the provided input:\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=5, grid:\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n   The diagonals are not constant. So why is the answer NO? Because the diagonals must be constant.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=3, grid:\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n   The main diagonal: [w, s, w] -> not constant -> but the example says YES.\n\n   There's a misunderstanding. Let me check the example again.\n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   and output is:\n\n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n   For the second example, let me draw:\n\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n   Now, the diagonals are:\n        Main diagonal: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> all 'w'\n        Other diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> all 'w'\n\n   So both diagonals are the same letter 'w'. Then, the rest of the squares must be the same letter (which is different from 'w').\n\n   The rest of the squares are:\n        (0,1): 's",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: The first condition requires that all letters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are identical.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**: All letters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n3. **Validation**: If both conditions are satisfied, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThe solution involves:\n- Iterating through the grid to collect all letters on the main and anti-diagonals.\n- Verifying that all letters on both diagonals are the same.\n- Checking that all non-diagonal letters are identical and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1_letter = None\n    diag2_letter = None\n    center_set = set()\n    non_diag_letters = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                if diag1_letter is None:\n                    diag1_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != diag1_letter:\n                        diag1_letter = None\n                        break\n            if i + j == n - 1:\n                if diag2_letter is None:\n                    diag2_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != diag2_letter:\n                        diag2_letter = None\n                        break\n            if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n                non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n    \n    if diag1_letter is None or diag2_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if grid[i][j] != next(iter(non_diag_letters)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n    \n    if len(non_diag_letters) != 1 or next(iter(non_diag_letters())) == diag1_letter or next(iter(non_diag_letters())) == diag2_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It checks all elements on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`). It ensures all elements on these diagonals are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: It collects all letters not on the diagonals into a set. These letters must all be identical and different from the diagonal letters.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the required conditions by leveraging set operations and nested loops to check each element's position relative to the diagonals. The solution ensures correctness by thoroughly validating both the diagonal and non-diagonal conditions.",
