Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, we can recycle: every time we have 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle.\n\n How it works:\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We can burn all of them (which gives 'a' hours and 'a' old candles).\n   Then we use the old candles to make new ones: floor(old_candles / b) new candles, and the remainder old candles remain.\n\n However, note that we can interleave the burning and recycling. But the problem says we act optimally.\n\n Actually, the optimal strategy is to burn as many as possible at each step, and then recycle.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total = 0 (total hours)\n   Let current_new = a\n   Let current_old = 0\n\n   While current_new > 0:\n        Burn all the current_new candles: \n            total += current_new\n            Then these become old: so we add current_new to current_old, and set current_new to 0.\n\n        Now, with the current_old, we can make new candles: \n            new_from_old = current_old // b\n            Then the remaining old candles are current_old % b.\n\n        Then set current_new = new_from_old (the new candles we made) and current_old = current_old % b.\n\n   However, note: after making new candles, we can burn them in the next iteration.\n\n But wait: the example input \"4 2\" gives 7.\n\n   Step-by-step for [4,2]:\n        Start: current_new = 4, current_old = 0, total=0.\n        Burn 4: total becomes 4, current_old becomes 4, current_new becomes 0.\n        Then from current_old=4, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and remainder 0.\n        Now: current_new=2, current_old=0, total=4.\n        Burn 2: total becomes 6, current_old becomes 2, current_new becomes 0.\n        Then from current_old=2, we can make 2//2=1 new candle, remainder 0.\n        Now: current_new=1, current_old=0, total=6.\n        Burn 1: total becomes 7, current_old becomes 1, current_new becomes 0.\n        Then from current_old=1, we make 0 new candles (since 1<2), so we stop.\n\n   So the answer is 7.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do without explicitly tracking current_new and current_old by using a while loop.\n\n   But note: we can also think of it as:\n        total_hours = 0\n        candles = a\n        while candles > 0:\n            total_hours += candles\n            # Now, we get 'candles' used up (burned) and they become old.\n            # Then we can form new candles: candles = candles // b + (candles % b != 0 ? 0 : 0) ... actually, we need to account for the old candles.\n\n        However, let me restructure:\n\n        We can simulate:\n\n        total = 0\n        new_candles = a\n        old_candles = 0\n\n        while new_candles > 0:\n            # Burn all new_candles\n            total += new_candles\n            old_candles += new_candles\n            new_candles = 0\n\n            # Now, convert old_candles to new_candles\n            # How many new candles? old_candles // b\n            # Remainder old_candles % b will be left\n            new_candles = old_candles // b\n            old_candles = old_candles % b\n\n        This is the same as above.\n\n   However, note that the above simulation does not account for the fact that the new_candles we just got from recycling are burned in the same way. \n\n   But wait, in our simulation we set new_candles to the result of the division and then in the next iteration we burn them. That's correct.\n\n   But there is an alternative: we can use a mathematical formula or iterative method until no more candles are available.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (a, b up to 1000), the simulation is efficient.\n\n   However, let's test with the second sample: Input \"6 3\"\n\n        Start: new_candles=6, old_candles=0, total=0.\n        Burn 6: total=6, old_candles=6, new_candles=0.\n        Then: new_candles = 6//3 = 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour, and after burning, it becomes a burnt candle. These burnt candles can be recycled to form new candles based on a given ratio.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (`a`) and the recycling ratio (`b`).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: \n   - **Burning Phase**: Burn all available new candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: Convert the burnt candles into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of the total burnt candles by `b`, and the remainder becomes the leftover burnt candles that cannot be converted further in this step.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more new candles left to burn.\n4. **Output**: The total accumulated hours from the burning phases is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage by always burning all available candles before recycling the burnt ones into new ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    new_candles = a\n    old_candles = 0\n    \n    while new_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        old_candles += new_candles\n        new_candles = old_candles // b\n        old_candles = old_candles % b\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (recycling ratio).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` keeps track of the total burning time, `new_candles` starts with `a`, and `old_candles` is initialized to zero.\n3. **Loop Execution**:\n   - **Burning**: Each iteration burns all `new_candles`, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n   - **Recycling**: The burnt candles (`old_candles`) are converted into new candles. The number of new candles is calculated as `old_candles // b`, and the remainder (`old_candles % b`) remains as leftover burnt candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when no new candles are left (`new_candles` becomes zero).\n5. **Output**: The accumulated `total_hours` is printed, representing the maximum hours the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
