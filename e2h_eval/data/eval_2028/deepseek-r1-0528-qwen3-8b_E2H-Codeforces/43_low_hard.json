He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, but note that C appends c's and the condition on the number of c's is defined in terms of existing a's and b's).\n 2. The string is built as:\n    - First, A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n    - Then B appends some number of 'b's.\n    - Then C appends some number of 'c's, which must be equal to either the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string after B's appending.\n\n However, note: when C appends the 'c's, the count of 'a' and 'b' that he uses for the condition is the entire string at that time (which includes A's a's and B's b's). But note: after C appends, the entire string has:\n   - count_a = original a's (which is fixed)\n   - count_b = original a's part + B's appended b's? Actually, no: the process is:\n        Step1: A's string (only 'a's) -> let n_a0 = count of 'a'\n        Step2: B appends some 'b's -> now the string is n_a0 times 'a' and n_b0 times 'b'. So total length = n_a0 + n_b0, and the counts are n_a0 and n_b0.\n        Step3: C appends k times 'c', where k must be either n_a0 or n_b0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string at the time C appends is the one after B, so the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed from step2.\n\n However, note: the entire string we are given includes the 'c's. So the total counts are:\n   total_a = n_a0\n   total_b = n_b0\n   total_c = k, and k is either n_a0 or n_b0.\n\n But also note: the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So n_a0>=1, n_b0>=1.\n\n Important: The order must be such that all the 'a's come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's. Because:\n   - A gives a string of 'a's.\n   - B appends 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends 'c's to the end.\n\n Therefore, the entire string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no 'a' after 'b', no 'b' after 'c'. Actually, the string must be split into three contiguous parts: [a's] [b's] [c's].\n\n Steps to solve:\n\n 1. Check if the string has any invalid character? The input is guaranteed to have only 'a','b','c'.\n\n 2. We must ensure that the string does not have any 'b' before an 'a' or any 'c' before an 'a' or 'b'? Actually, the process forces the order.\n\n    Conditions on the string:\n      - All 'a's must come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\n    So, if we find a 'b' in the part that should be 'a's, that's invalid. Similarly, if we find an 'a' after a 'b', invalid. Also, if we find a 'c' before an 'a' or 'b' (i.e., anywhere that is not at the end) then it's invalid.\n\n 3. Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c' in the entire string.\n\n    Let:\n        n_a = count of 'a'\n        n_b = count of 'b'\n        n_c = count of 'c'\n\n    Then, the condition for C is that n_c must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n 4. However, we must also check the order. The string must be non-decreasing in the alphabet: meaning that we can traverse and if we see an 'a', then we can only have 'a' until we switch to 'b', then only 'b' until we switch to 'c', and then only 'c'.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then, while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then, while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: first, a string of 'a's is given; second, some 'b's are appended to the end; and third, some 'c's are appended, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Any deviation from this order means the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c') in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    S = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check for the correct order: all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n    n = len(S)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    while i < n and S[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n        \n    while i < n and S[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = S.count('a')\n    count_b = S.count('b')\n    count_c = S.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string adheres to the required order by sequentially verifying that all 'a's come before 'b's, which in turn come before 'c's. If any character appears out of order, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counts**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters are then determined.\n3. **Validation**: The solution checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. Additionally, it ensures there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' present. If all conditions are satisfied, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the structural and numerical constraints of the problem, ensuring correctness while maintaining simplicity.",
