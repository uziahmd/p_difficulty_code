Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s which is the binary representation of m (without spaces)\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as the sum of a_i for every bit i that is set in x.\n        However, note that the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the binary representation of m \n        is given as a string of length n (so m has exactly n bits).\n\n But note: the problem states that the binary representation of m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}, meaning \n        m = s0*2^{n-1} + s1*2^{n-2} + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n However, observe that the example: \n        Input: \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n        Here, n=5, so the binary representation has 5 digits. Then m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n        \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\"\n\n Actually, let me read the example again: \n        The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\n\n In the example, the third line is \"11010\", so s0='1', s1='1', s2='0', s3='1', s4='0'\n\n Then m = 1*(2^(4)) + 1*(2^(3)) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n But the example says: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23\" which is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3. This corresponds to the bits set at positions 0,1,3.\n\n However, note the function f(x) is defined by the bits in x. But the array a is indexed from 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a_i is used when the i-th bit is set?\n\n Actually, the example says: \n        For n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011 in binary, but note: the problem uses the binary representation with n bits? Actually, no, because n is the length of the array, and the function is defined for x from 0 to 2^n - 1? \n\n Let me clarify: \n        The function f(x) is defined by: \n          f(x) = sum_{i} [if the i-th bit of x is set then a_i]\n\n However, note the example: \n        n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in base2, but 11 in base10). \n        The binary representation of 11 is '1011', which has 4 bits. But our array a has 4 elements (a0, a1, a2, a3).\n\n How does the indexing work? The problem says: \"bit(i)\" is the i-th position. \n\n There are two common ways to index bits: \n        - little-endian (LSB is bit0) or big-endian (MSB is bit0)?\n\n But note: the input gives the binary representation of m as a string of n digits. The first digit is the most significant, so:\n\n        m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n Therefore, the i-th character in the string (0-indexed) corresponds to the bit for 2^(n-1-i). \n\n Now, how does the function f(x) use the bits? The problem says: \n        f(x) = sum_{i} [bit(i) ? a_i : 0]\n\n But note: the array a has n elements, indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n However, if we consider the bits in the usual way (from least significant to most significant), then the i-th bit (with i being the exponent) is the one that multiplies 2^i. \n\n But the problem's binary representation of m is given as a string of n bits, where",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) among all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where each element \\( a_i \\) is included if the \\( i \\)-th bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that \\( f(x) \\) is maximized when we include as many high-value elements from the array \\( a \\) as possible, provided that the corresponding bits in \\( x \\) are set and \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\). The challenge is to determine which bits can be set without violating the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n2. **Binary Representation Handling**: The binary string provided represents \\( m \\) with \\( n \\) bits. Each bit in this string corresponds to a specific power of two. The most significant bit (leftmost) corresponds to \\( 2^{n-1} \\), and the least significant bit (rightmost) corresponds to \\( 2^0 \\).\n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: We process the bits from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit position, we decide whether setting it to 1 in \\( x \\) would still keep \\( x \\) within the limit \\( m \\). If setting a bit to 1 does not cause \\( x \\) to exceed \\( m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) in the sum. If it does, we leave the bit unset.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Special consideration is given to cases where the current bit in \\( m \\) is 0. In such cases, we cannot set the corresponding bit in \\( x \\) to 1 without exceeding \\( m \\). However, we can still consider setting less significant bits to 1 if they do not affect the higher bits.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each bit exactly once, making it linear in the number of bits, which is efficient for large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^5 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    current = 0\n    max_value = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(bin_str)):\n        bit_char = bin_str[i]\n        current_bit_value = 1 << (len(bin_str) - 1 - i)\n        if bit_char == '1':\n            total_sum += a[i]\n            current += current_bit_value\n        else:\n            if current + current_bit_value <= m:\n                total_sum += a[i]\n                current += current_bit_value\n            else:\n                pass\n        \n        if current > m:\n            current = m\n        else:\n            if current != m:\n                total_sum += sum(a[i+1:]) - sum(a[:i+1])\n                break\n        \n    print(total_sum)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\) of \\( n \\) integers, and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total_sum`, `current`, and `max_value` are initialized to accumulate the sum, track the current value of \\( x \\), and store the maximum sum found, respectively.\n\n3. **Processing Bits**: The loop processes each bit from the most significant to the least significant:\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is '1', the corresponding element in \\( a \\) is added to `total_sum`, and the bit's value is included in `current`.\n   - If the bit is '0', the algorithm checks whether setting this bit to 1 in \\( x \\) would still keep \\( x \\) within \\( m \\). If yes, the corresponding element is added; otherwise, it is skipped.\n\n4. **Adjustment for Higher Bits**: If at any point setting a bit causes \\( x \\) to exceed \\( m \\), the algorithm adjusts by setting all subsequent bits to 1, maximizing the sum from the remaining elements.\n\n5. **Output**: The maximum sum `total_sum` is printed after processing all relevant bits.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints to maximize the function \\( f(x) \\) by leveraging bit manipulation and a greedy selection strategy.",
