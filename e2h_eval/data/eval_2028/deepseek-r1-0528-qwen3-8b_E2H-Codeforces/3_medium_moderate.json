Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap in the middle is (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. The lanterns light an interval of [x-d, x+d] for each lantern at x.\n\n Another approach:\n  We can think of the street as needing to be covered by intervals. The entire street [0, l] must be covered.\n\n  Let's define the coverage of the entire street by the lanterns. We can use the following:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the array of lantern positions.\n  Step 2: We need to cover from 0 to l.\n\n  The idea:\n   - The first lantern should cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position + d. But actually, the coverage from the first lantern must extend to 0, so the distance from the first lantern to 0 must be <= d. Hence, d must be at least (first lantern's position - 0) / 1? Actually, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d >= (first lantern's position) because the first lantern is at 'a0' and must reach 0: so d >= a0.\n\n  However, wait: if we have multiple lanterns, we can have a lantern in the middle. Actually, we can consider the gaps between the lanterns.\n\n  Alternate method:\n\n  Let the sorted lantern positions be a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\n  We can traverse the street from left to right and see what is the minimum d needed.\n\n  The entire street is from 0 to l.\n\n  Conditions:\n   1. The leftmost point 0 must be covered by the first lantern or a lantern to the right. But the first lantern is the one closest to 0. The condition: d must be at least (a[0] - 0) (because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]).\n   2. For each gap between two consecutive lanterns (from a[i] to a[i+1]), the two lanterns together must cover the entire segment. The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The required d must be such that from the left lantern (a[i]) we go right by d, and from the right lantern (a[i+1]) we go left by d, and these two must meet or overlap. Therefore, the gap (a[i+1] - a[i]) must be <= 2*d. So d must be at least ceil((a[i+1]-a[i])/2) but note we are looking for minimal d that covers the entire street.\n\n  However, note: the condition for a gap between two consecutive lanterns is that the entire segment from a[i] to a[i+1] is covered. The coverage from the left lantern extends from a[i]-d to a[i]+d, and the right lantern from a[i+1]-d to a[i+1]+d. To cover the gap, we require that a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, which simplifies to d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n  Also, the endpoints: \n      - The left endpoint: we require that the leftmost lantern (or any lantern) must cover 0. The minimal requirement from the left is that the left lantern must extend to 0: so d >= a[0] (if we consider only the leftmost lantern, but wait: what if there are multiple lanterns? Actually, the leftmost lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]+d, so we require a[0] + d >= 0? Actually, no, because 0 is to the left of a[0]. The condition is that 0 must be within d of a[0]: so a[0] - d <= 0 -> d >= a[0]. Similarly, the rightmost lantern must cover up to l: so a[n-1] + d >= l -> d >= l - a[n-1].\n\n  But wait: what if the lanterns are not at the ends? Actually, the problem says the street is from 0 to l, and the lanterns are at positions between 0 and l (inclusive). \n\n  So the conditions are:\n      d >= a[0]   [to cover from 0 to a[0]]\n      d >= l - a[-1]   [to cover from a[-1] to l]\n\n  And for each i from 0 to n-2:\n      d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2\n\n  Then the minimal d is the maximum of these values.\n\n  Example 1: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n      n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n      Condition 1: d >= 2 (because a[0]=2)\n      Condition 2: d >= 5-5 = 0 (but that's trivial)\n      Condition 3: for the gap (5-2)=3, then d >= 3/2 = 1.5.\n\n      Then the answer is max(2, 1.5) = 2.0\n\n  However, the example output is 2.0, but wait: let me check the sample explanation.\n\n  Explanation says: At d=2 the first lantern lights [0,4] and the second [3,5]. So the entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n  But according to our condition, we said d>=2 from the left, and d>=1.5 from the gap, so 2 is the maximum.\n\n  Why is the condition for the gap 1.5? Because the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so we require d to be at least 1.5 to cover the entire gap (since from 2 we go 1.5 to the right to 3.5, and from 5 we go 1.5 to the left to 3.5, so they meet at 3.5). But note: the entire street is [0,5]. The first lantern at 2 with d=1.5 would light from -0.5 to 3.5, so the left end 0 is covered (because 0 is in [-0.5,3.5]) and the gap from 3.5 to 5 is covered by the second lantern (which goes from 3.5 to 6.5). But wait, the problem says the street is from 0 to l (5). So the second lantern at 5 with d=1.5 covers [3.5,6.5] which includes [3.5,5]. So actually, d=1.5 would cover the entire street? \n\n  Let me simulate with d=1.5:\n      First lantern at 2: covers [2-1.5, 2+1.5] = [0.5, 3.5]. Then the left end 0 is not covered! Because 0 is less than 0.5.\n\n  So we must have d>=2 to cover 0. Therefore, the condition from the left is more stringent.\n\n  Now, let me check the example with d=1.5: \n      The first lantern only starts covering from 0.5, so 0 to 0.5 is not covered.\n\n  Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n      Condition 1: d must be at least a[0] (so that the leftmost lantern covers from 0 to a[0]+a[0] = 2*a[0]? Actually, no: the condition is that the leftmost lantern must cover 0. The distance from the leftmost lantern to 0 is a[0]. So we require d >= a[0] (because if d < a[0], then 0 is not covered).\n\n      Condition 2: d must be at least (last lantern position to l): l - a[-1] (so that the last lantern covers from a[-1] to l).\n\n      Condition 3: for each gap between two consecutive lanterns, we require d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n  Then the minimal d is the maximum of these.\n\n  But wait: is the condition for the left end really a[0]? Yes, because if d < a[0], then 0 is not covered.\n\n  Similarly, for the right end, if d < (l - a[-1]), then l is not covered.\n\n  Now, why did the example say d=2? Because the left end requires d>=2, and the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so condition 3 gives 1.5, but 2>1.5, so the maximum is 2.\n\n  Let me test the example: \n      Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n      Steps:\n        n=7, l=15\n        Sort the array: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n        Condition 1: d >= 0 (from the leftmost lantern at 0) -> d>=0 (trivial)\n        Condition 2: d >= 15-15 = 0 (trivial)\n        Now, the gaps:\n          gap1: 3-0 = 3 -> d >= 3/2 = 1.5\n          gap2: 5-3 = 2 -> d >= 1\n          gap3: 7-5 = 2 -> d >= 1\n          gap4: 9-7 = 2 -> d >= 1\n          gap5: 14-9 = 5 -> d >= 2.5\n          gap6: 15-14 = 1 -> d >= 0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        Output: 2.5\n\n      Which matches the sample.\n\n  However, wait: the leftmost lantern is at 0, so the condition for the left end is satisfied by d>=0. But note: the lantern at 0 must cover from 0-d to 0+d. Since d>=0, the left end is covered because 0-d might be negative, but the street starts at 0 and goes to l. The condition is that the street [0,l] must be covered. The lantern at 0 with d=2.5 will cover from -2.5 to 2.5, so the part [0,2.5] is covered. Then the next lantern is at 3. The gap from 2.5 to 3 is 0.5, which is covered by the lantern at 3 (which has d=2.5, so it covers from 0.5 to 5.5). So indeed, the entire street is covered.\n\n  But note: the condition for the left end was taken as d>=a[0] (which is 0) and that is automatically satisfied. However, what if we didn't have a lantern at 0?\n\n  Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n      Condition 1: d>=5 (to cover from 0 to 5, because the lantern at 5 must reach 0: 5-d<=0 -> d>=5)\n      Condition 2: d>=10-5=5\n      Condition 3: no gaps.\n\n      So d>=5.\n\n  This makes sense: the lantern at 5 must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, so d must be at least 5. Similarly, from 5 to 10 is 5, so d must be at least 5.\n\n  But wait, if d=5, then the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] exactly.\n\n  Therefore, the solution:\n\n      Read n, l\n      Read list a of n integers\n      Sort a\n\n      candidate1 = a[0]  # to cover from 0 to a[0]\n      candidate2 = l - a[-1] # to cover from a[-1] to l\n      candidate3 = 0.0\n      For i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          candidate3 = max(candidate3, gap / 2.0)\n\n      Then, d = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n  However, wait: the condition for the left end is actually that the first lantern must cover 0, so the required d from the left is a[0] (if we assume the first lantern is at a[0]). But what if we have multiple lanterns? Actually, the left end condition is independent: we require d >= a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). Similarly, the right end condition is d >= l - a[-1].\n\n  But note: the above reasoning for the left end: the leftmost lantern must cover 0, so d must be at least the distance from the leftmost lantern to 0, which is a[0]. Similarly, the rightmost lantern must cover l, so d must be at least l - a[-1].\n\n  However, what if we have two lanterns at the same position? That's handled by sorting and then the gap condition.\n\n  But wait: what if the leftmost lantern is not at 0? Then we require d >= a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). Similarly, if the rightmost lantern is not at l, then we require d >= l - a[-1].\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # If there's only one lantern, then we have two conditions: covering the left and the right.\n      # But if there are multiple, we have the gaps as well.\n\n      # Edge: if n==0, then we have no lanterns, then we must cover the entire street [0, l] with no lanterns? Then d must be at least (l/2) but also we have two ends: d must be at least l/2? Actually, no: without any lanterns, we cannot cover the street unless we set d to something that covers the entire street from a single point? But wait, the problem says the street is lit by n lanterns. If n=0, then we have no lanterns. Then we must cover [0, l] without any lantern? That's impossible unless we set d to infinity, but the problem probably assumes at least one lantern? The input constraints say n>=1.\n\n      # So we assume n>=1.\n\n      # Conditions:\n      #   left_condition = a[0]   (because the first lantern is at a[0]; we need d >= a[0])\n      #   right_condition = l - a[-1]\n      #   mid_condition = 0\n      #   for i in range(len(a)-1):\n      #       gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n      #       mid_condition = max(mid_condition, gap/2)\n\n      d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n      # Now, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          # The gap between the current lantern and the previous one? Actually, we traverse from left to right.\n          # But we already considered the two ends. Now, for the gaps between the lanterns, we need to cover the space between two consecutive lanterns.\n          # However, note: the gap between two consecutive lanterns a[i-1] and a[i] is a[i] - a[i-1]. But we are iterating from the beginning, so we can do:\n\n          # Alternatively, we can iterate from 0 to n-2 for the gaps.\n\n      # But note: the above for loop for gaps is missing. Let me correct:\n\n      # Actually, I did a mistake: the above for loop for mid_condition is not defined. Let me restructure.\n\n      # We'll compute:\n      #   d_candidate = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n      #   Then for each gap between consecutive lanterns (from i=0 to n-2), we require d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n      #   So d_candidate = max(d_candidate, (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for all i)\n\n      # But note: the conditions from the ends and the gaps are independent, so we take the maximum of all three.\n\n      # Let me restructure the code:\n\n      candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]   # the two end conditions\n\n      # For the gaps:\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The required d for this gap is gap / 2.0\n          candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n      d_ans = max(candidates)\n\n  However, wait: is the condition for the gaps correctly represented? \n\n  Consider two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (with x<y). The gap is (y-x). To cover the entire street between x and y, the two lanterns must have their light overlap. The light from x goes to x+d, and from y goes to y-d. We require that x+d >= y-d, so d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n  But note: the entire street from 0 to l must be covered. The gaps condition ensures that between two consecutive lanterns, the entire segment [x, y] is covered. However, the ends are already handled separately.\n\n  But wait: what about the part from the first lantern to the next? Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next lantern's position minus d? Not necessarily, because the next lantern might cover the left part of the gap. The condition we are using for gaps is sufficient for the entire street, because the gaps condition ensures that every point between two lanterns is covered by at least one lantern (actually, by two if overlapping, but that's okay).\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left end is independent of the gaps. The left end condition is only about the first lantern and the point 0. Similarly, the right end condition is about the last lantern and the point l.\n\n  Therefore, we can compute:\n\n      left_cover = a[0]   # d must be at least this to cover 0 from the first lantern\n      right_cover = l - a[-1]   # d must be at least this to cover l from the last lantern\n\n      gaps_cover = 0\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The gap requires d to be at least gap/2.0, so we take the maximum over gaps.\n          if gap > gaps_cover * 2.0:\n              gaps_cover = gap / 2.0\n\n      d_ans = max(left_cover, right_cover, gaps_cover)\n\n  But wait, in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\": \n      left_cover = 2, right_cover = 0, gaps_cover = (5-2)/2 = 1.5 -> then d_ans = 2.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left_cover is 2, but the condition for the right_cover is 0, and the gaps_cover is 1.5. Then the maximum is 2.\n\n  But wait, what if the left_cover is 0? Then we don't need to cover from 0 to the first lantern if the first lantern is at 0? Then the condition is 0, which is correct.\n\n  However, there is a flaw: the condition for the left_cover is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d must be at least the distance from 0 to the first lantern, which is a[0]. But note: if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition is 0, meaning no requirement from the left. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then the condition from the right is 0.\n\n  But now consider: if the first lantern is at 0, then we don't require d>=a[0] (which is 0) so that's okay.\n\n  However, what if we have two lanterns at the same location? Then the gap condition will use the same value, but that's okay because the gap is 0.\n\n  But wait: what if the lanterns are not sorted? We sorted them.\n\n  However, there is a better way: we can combine the conditions.\n\n  Actually, we can think of the entire street as being covered by the union of the intervals [x_i - d, x_i + d]. We want the smallest d such that [0, l] is contained in the union.\n\n  Steps for an alternative solution:\n\n      Sort the lanterns: a\n\n      We know that the left end 0 must be <= d from the first lantern: so d >= a[0] (if we consider the first lantern, then 0 must be in [a[0]-d, a[0]+d] -> d >= a[0] (since a[0] is nonnegative and 0<=a[0] then the left side is the constraint).\n\n      Similarly, the right end l must be <= d from the last lantern: d >= l - a[-1].\n\n      And for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns, we require that the two intervals [a[i]-d, a[i]+d] and [a[i+1]-d, a[i+1]+d] must overlap. The condition for overlap is: a[i+1] - d <= a[i] + d, i.e., d >= (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.\n\n      Then the minimal d is the maximum of these three types of requirements.\n\n  However, note: the above conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\n  But wait: is the condition for the left end really just a[0]? What if there are multiple lanterns to the right? The left end is covered by the first lantern, but what if the first lantern is very far? Actually, the condition for the left end is independent of the rest. Similarly, the condition for the right end is independent.\n\n  But note: the gaps condition might be more stringent than the ends? Or vice versa.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # Check the left end: 0 must be covered -> d >= a[0]\n      # Check the right end: l must be covered -> d >= l - a[-1]\n\n      # Check gaps: for i in range(n-1): d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2\n\n      # Then the minimal d is the maximum of these.\n\n      # However, note: the gap condition does not require anything if there are no gaps (n=1) then we have only two conditions.\n\n      # Let me write:\n\n      d_ans = 0.0\n\n      # Condition from the left end\n      if n == 0:\n          # But n>=1 per input, so skip\n          pass\n\n      # The left end condition: d must be at least a[0] (if there is a gap from 0 to a[0])\n      d_ans = max(d_ans, a[0])\n\n      # The right end condition: d must be at least l - a[-1]\n      d_ans = max(d_ans, l - a[-1])\n\n      # The gaps condition: for each gap between consecutive lanterns, we require d >= (gap)/2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n          if gap > 0:\n              required_for_gap = gap / 2.0\n          else:\n              required_for_gap = 0.0\n          d_ans = max(d_ans, required_for_gap)\n\n      # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_ans))\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n      n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n      d_ans initially 0\n      Left end: max(0,2) -> 2\n      Right end: max(2, 5-5=0) -> 2\n      Then gaps: gap=5-2=3 -> required_for_gap=1.5 -> max(2,1.5) -> 2\n      Output: 2.0000000000\n\n  Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n      Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n      Left end: 0\n      Right end: 15-15=0\n      Gaps: \n          3-0=3 -> 1.5\n          5-3=2 -> 1.0\n          7-5=2 -> 1.0\n          9-7=2 -> 1.0\n          14-9=5 -> 2.5\n          15-14=1 -> 0.5\n      Then d_ans = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n  Another test: n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n      Left end: 5\n      Right end: 10-5=5\n      Gaps: no gaps (n-1=0, so no loop)\n      Then d_ans=5\n\n  Another test: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]\n      Left end: 0\n      Right end: 0\n      Gaps: 5-0=5 -> 2.5, 10-5=5 -> 2.5 -> d_ans=2.5\n\n  But wait, with d=2.5, the first lantern at 0 covers [-2.5,2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered. The second lantern at 5 covers [2.5,7.5]. The third lantern at 10 covers [7.5,12.5]. So the entire street [0,10] is covered? \n      [0,2.5] from first, [2.5,7.5] from second, [7.5,10] from third. So yes, covered.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the gaps is met (each gap requires 2.5) and the ends are 0.\n\n  But wait: what if we have a lantern at 0 and then a gap of 10 (like n=1, l=10, a=[0])?\n      Then: \n        Left end: 0\n        Right end: 10-0=10\n        Gaps: none\n        Then d_ans=10.\n\n  With d=10, the lantern at 0 covers [-10,10] which includes [0,10]. Correct.\n\n  One more test: n=3, l=10, a=[1,2,9]\n      Left end: 1\n      Right end: 10-9=1\n      Gaps: \n          2-1=1 -> 0.5\n          9-2=7 -> 3.5\n      Then d_ans = max(1,1,0.5,3.5) = 3.5\n\n  Check: \n      With d=3.5, \n        First lantern at 1: [-3.5,4.5] -> covers [0,4.5] (at least 0 to 1+3.5=4.5)\n        Second lantern at 2: [-2.5,5.5] -> covers [0,5.5] (but already covered by the first)\n        Third lantern at 9: [5.5,12.5] -> covers from 5.5 to 10.\n\n      The gap from 4.5 to 5.5 is covered by the third lantern? Actually, the second lantern extends to 5.5, so the entire street from 0 to 10 is covered.\n\n  However, wait: the gap between the first and second lantern is 1, which requires d>=0.5, but the gap between the second and third is 7, which requires d>=3.5. So the minimal d is 3.5.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n      d_ans = 0.0\n\n      # Condition for the left end: d_ans must be at least a[0]\n      if n > 0:\n          d_ans = max(d_ans, a[0])\n      # Condition for the right end: d_ans must be at least l - a[-1]\n      d_ans = max(d_ans, l - a[-1])\n\n      # Condition for the gaps\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The required d for this gap is half the gap\n          if gap % 2 != 0:\n              # Doesn't matter, we are using float\n              pass\n          candidate = gap / 2.0\n          if candidate > d_ans:\n              d_ans = candidate\n\n      # Format the answer to 10 decimal places\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_ans))\n\n  But wait: what if there are duplicate lanterns? For example, two lanterns at the same position. Then the gap is 0, which doesn't change the candidate.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point. Our gap calculation uses consecutive elements, so if two consecutive lanterns are the same, the gap is 0, so no problem.\n\n  But what if there are duplicates in the middle? It doesn't affect the gaps.\n\n  Therefore, the above code should be correct.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples.\n\n  Example Input: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n  For the first: \n      n=7, l=15, a=[0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n      d_ans = max(0, 15-15) = 0, then update with gaps: max(0, 3/2, 2/2, 2/2, 2/2, 5/2, 1/2) -> 5/2=2.5\n\n  For the second:\n      n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n      d_ans = max(2, 0) = 2, then update with gap (3/2=1.5) -> still 2.\n\n  But wait, the example output for the second sample is 2.0, which is correct.\n\n  However, note: the problem statement says the input format is two lines. The example input is given as two strings in a list? Actually, the example input is:\n\n      Input: \n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n  But in the problem, the input is two separate lines. The example input is provided as two strings for two test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\n  Actually, the problem says:\n\n      Input\n      The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l).\n\n  So we read one line for n and l, then the next line for the n integers.\n\n  But the example input is given as:\n\n      Input\n      ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n  This seems like two test cases? Actually, the problem is competitive programming and the input is standard. The example input is two separate test cases for demonstration.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem statement.\n\n  In competitive programming, the input is usually one test case. But the example input is provided as two strings, so maybe we are expected to handle multiple test cases? \n\n  Let me read the problem statement again: it does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n  But the example input is given as two strings in a list. This might be a formatting issue in the example.\n\n  The sample input in the problem is:\n\n      Input:\n        7 15\n        15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n        2 5\n        2 5\n\n  But wait, that would be two test cases. However, the problem does not specify that. \n\n  Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n      Input\n      ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n  This is confusing. But the problem says:\n\n      Example\n      Input\n      ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n      Output\n      ['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n  This suggests that the input is a list of two strings, each string being a test case.\n\n  But the problem statement does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n  Clarification: the problem says \"The first line\" and \"The next line\", meaning one test case.\n\n  However, the example input is provided as a list of two strings, and the output as a list of two strings. This might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n  But looking at the problem statement on the original source (if available) might help. Since we don't have that, let me check the problem constraints: n>=1, and the input format.\n\n  The intended input is one test case. The example provided two test cases for illustration.\n\n  Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n  However, the example input in the problem is given as two separate lines. So we read:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  But the example input is provided as a string that combines two lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n      \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n  which is one line for n and l, and the next line for the lanterns.\n\n  So the example input is two lines.\n\n  The problem's example input is given as a list of two strings, but that is just for representation. We are to read from stdin.\n\n  Therefore, the code above is for one test case.\n\n  But the problem might have multiple test cases? The problem statement does not specify. However, the example output is two numbers. \n\n  Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"Print the minimum light radius d\", singular.\n\n  Since the problem is from a competition and sometimes there are multiple test cases, we should check the problem statement. But the problem statement says:\n\n      Input\n      The first line contains two integers n, l ...\n\n  and then the next line.\n\n  So we assume one test case.\n\n  However, the example input is given as two test cases. \n\n  Actually, the example input format in the problem is:\n\n      Input\n      ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n  This is likely a formatting issue. The actual input would be:\n\n      7 15\n      15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n      2 5\n      2 5\n\n  But that would be two test cases.\n\n  After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem. Typically, competitive programming problems read until EOF.\n\n  But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n  However, the sample input is two test cases. \n\n  How to resolve?\n\n  The problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n, l\", meaning that the first thing we read is n and l. Then the next line is the list of n integers.\n\n  But if we have two test cases, then we would read:\n\n      Line1: \"7 15\"\n      Line2: \"15 5 3 7 9 ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This allows us to systematically check the coverage between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n2. **Check End Conditions**: The leftmost point `0` must be covered by the first lantern, which requires `d` to be at least the distance from `0` to the first lantern (i.e., `a[0]`). Similarly, the rightmost point `l` must be covered by the last lantern, requiring `d` to be at least `l - a[-1]`.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap that can be covered without overlapping lantern lights is half the distance between them. Thus, `d` must be at least half the distance between any two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum `d`**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among the left end condition, right end condition, and all gap conditions. This ensures that all segments of the street are adequately covered by the lanterns' lights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    d_ans = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        d_ans = max(d_ans, a[0])\n    d_ans = max(d_ans, l - a[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        candidate = gap / 2.0\n        if candidate > d_ans:\n            d_ans = candidate\n            \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_ans))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order, which simplifies checking the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Left and Right End Conditions**: The left end condition ensures that the first lantern covers the start of the street (point `0`), and the right end condition ensures the last lantern covers the end of the street (point `l`).\n4. **Gap Conditions**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the required `d` is half the distance between them. The largest value from all these conditions determines the minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure the entire street is illuminated by the minimal possible light radius, leveraging sorting and systematic evaluation of gaps and endpoints.",
