She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open. Initially, all tabs from 1 to n are open and the cursor is at `pos`.\n\n Operations:\n - Move the cursor left or right (but cannot go beyond the current minimum or maximum tab index). Note: the boundaries change as tabs are closed, but we can simulate by only considering the remaining tabs [a, b] which initially is [1, n].\n - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (which will set a = current cursor position) or to the right of the cursor (which will set b = current cursor position).\n\n However, note that we want to leave only [l, r]. So we must close all tabs with indices < l and > r.\n\n Since closing operations set the boundaries, we can think in terms of two parts:\n  1. Closing the left part (tabs < l)\n  2. Closing the right part (tabs > r)\n\n But note: sometimes we can do both in one operation if the cursor is appropriately positioned, but the problem is that the closure operations require being at a certain position.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: If the entire initial set is already the desired segment, i.e., [l, r] covers [1, n]? Actually, no: we want to leave [l, r] and remove the rest. So if the desired segment is [l, r] and the current set is [1, n], then we have to close the parts outside [l, r].\n\n However, note: the example input \"5 2 1 5\" gives 0. That means that [1,5] is the entire set, so no operation is needed.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We need to close two parts: \n   Part A: [1, l-1]\n   Part B: [r+1, n]\n\n We can do the operations in any order, but note that moving the cursor is constrained by the current boundaries.\n\n We have two types of operations: move (which takes 1 second per move) and close (which takes 1 second and sets the boundary).\n\n However, note that after a close operation, the boundaries change. \n\n But observe: we can also consider that we don't necessarily have to move the cursor to the very edge (l or r) to close one side. For example, to close the left part, we must have the cursor at a position that is at least l (so that when we close the left, we close from the current left boundary to i-1, but we want to close everything from 1 to l-1). Similarly for the right.\n\n Actually, to close the left part, we must be at a position >= l (and then closing the left will set the left boundary to the cursor's current position). But wait, the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" closes the tabs from the current left boundary to i-1. So if we are at a position i (>= l) and we close the left, then the new left boundary becomes i. But we want to close everything from the current left boundary (initially 1) up to l-1. Therefore, we must be at a position i such that i is at least l (so that i-1 is at least l-1, but actually we don't require i to be exactly l? Let me think:\n\n Example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n One solution:\n   Step1: move cursor to 2 (from 3 to 2: 1 second). Now the boundaries are [1,6] but note: we haven't closed anything yet, so the boundaries remain [1,6] until we close. Then we can close the left: closing [1,1] (because cursor is at 2, so left close removes [1,1]). Then we move to 4 (from 2 to 4: 2 seconds). Then close the right: closing [5,6] (if we are at 4, then right close removes [5,6]). Total seconds: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move from 2 to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n Alternatively, we might not move to 2 first. But note: we can also consider closing the right first.\n\n However, note: the problem says that we can close all the tabs to the left OR to the right. And the boundaries are updated after each close.\n\n Alternate approach: think about the necessary moves.\n\n We have to get the cursor to the segment [l, r] because to close one side we must be at a position that allows us to cover the entire unwanted part.\n\n Actually, to close the left part (tabs [1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and calculating the necessary moves and closure operations efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Luba needs to close two parts of the tabs: those before `l` (left part) and those after `r` (right part). The operations involve moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs either to the left or right of the cursor.\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal time is derived by considering the distance the cursor needs to move to reach the boundaries `l` or `r` and the subsequent closure operations. If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking three scenarios:\n   - If the initial segment [1, n] is entirely within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - If only one side (left or right) needs closing, the time is calculated based on moving the cursor to the nearest boundary and performing the closure.\n   - If both sides need closing, the time is the sum of moving to both boundaries and performing two closure operations.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution runs in constant time O(1) since it involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it highly efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (pos < l) or (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (pos > r) or (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - l)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if not left_needed and right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - r)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    left_moves = abs(pos - l)\n    right_moves = abs(pos - r)\n    total_seconds = left_moves + 1 + right_moves + 1\n    print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Single Side Closure**: If only the left or right side needs closing, calculate the moves required to reach the nearest boundary (`l` or `r`) and add one second for the closure operation.\n3. **Both Sides Closure**: If both sides need closing, calculate the moves to reach both boundaries separately, add the moves and two closure operations (one for each side), and sum them up for the total time.\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures minimal operations by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
