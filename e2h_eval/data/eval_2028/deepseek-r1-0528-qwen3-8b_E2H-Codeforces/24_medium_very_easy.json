She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open.\n\n There are a few cases:\n\n 1. If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything.\n\n However, note that initially we have all tabs from 1 to n, and we want only [l, r]. So if the current open tabs are exactly [l, r], then no operations are needed.\n\n But note: the problem says \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\". Initially, we have all n tabs. We need to close the ones outside [l, r].\n\n However, we can also consider that sometimes we might not even need to move the cursor if we are at the right position and we can close in one go.\n\n Steps:\n\n - We can close either side by moving the cursor and then closing.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: When the desired segment [l, r] covers the entire range [1, n]:\n   Then we do nothing -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we need to close the left part (if any) and the right part (if any).\n\n How to close the left part?\n   We must close all tabs from 1 to l-1. To do that, we can:\n     Option A: Move the cursor to the leftmost tab that is still open (which will be l) and then close the left part? \n        But note: the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" requires that the cursor is at a position i, and then it closes [a, i-1]. \n        However, after closing, the minimum index a changes.\n\n But note: we can also consider closing the right part first or the left part first.\n\n However, note that the problem allows two types of moves per second: moving left/right (but constrained by the current boundaries) and closing one side.\n\n Important: After closing, the boundaries (a, b) change. For example, if we close the left part, then the new a becomes the current minimum index (which was the next tab after the closed ones). Similarly for the right.\n\n But note: we are allowed to close only one side at a time. Also, we can move the cursor arbitrarily (with the constraint that we cannot go beyond the current a and b) until we are at the desired position.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider two strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   Steps:\n     1. Move the cursor to the left boundary (the tab at l) because we want to close from the left. However, we start at `pos`.\n        - Moving from `pos` to `l`: requires |pos - l| moves (each move one tab per second).\n     2. Then, close the left part (all tabs to the left of l): 1 second.\n        Now the remaining tabs are from l to n, and the cursor is at l.\n     3. Then, we need to close the right part (from r+1 to n). To do that, we must move the cursor from l to r (because we can only close the right part when the cursor is at r or beyond? Actually, to close the right part, we need the cursor to be at a position i such that we can close [i+1, b]. We want to close everything from r+1 to n. So we must be at a position >= r? Actually, the operation is: close all the tabs to the right of the cursor. So if we are at r, then we close [r+1, n]. But if we are at a position > r, then we would close from i+1 to n, which is acceptable as long as i>=r? Actually, we can be at any position from r to n to close the right part (but note: the tabs from r+1 to n are the ones to close, so we don't want to close any tab below r). \n\n        However, note: after closing the left part, the boundaries are from l to n. So the cursor is at l (which is <= r). We need to move from l to r: |l - r| moves.\n     4. Then close the right part: 1 second.\n\n     Total for this strategy: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2.\n\n Strategy 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n   Steps:\n     1. Move the cursor to the right boundary (the tab at r): |pos - r| moves.\n     2. Close the right part: 1 second.\n        Now the remaining tabs are from 1 to r, and the cursor is at r.\n     3. Move the cursor from r to l: |r - l| moves.\n     4. Close the left part: 1 second.\n\n     Total: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\n But wait: what if the desired segment [l, r] is already the entire set? Then we don't need to do anything. Also, note that there might be cases where we don't need to close both sides.\n\n Additionally, we might consider that sometimes we can close one side without moving the cursor, but note: to close the left part we must be at a position that is at least l (so that after closing we don't close the desired segment). Actually, the operation for closing the left part is defined as closing the tabs from a to i-1. So if we are at i, then we require that i-1 >= a (which is always true) and we are closing from a to i-1. But we don't want to close the desired segment. So we must be at a position i such that i-1 is less than l? Actually, no: we want to close everything from the current left boundary (which is initially 1) to i-1. But we want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close the tab l. Therefore, we must be at a position i such that i >= l (so that i-1 >= l-1) but then we would close from a to i-1, and we don't want to include l. So we must be at i = l. Then we close from a (which is 1) to l-1. That works.\n\n Similarly, for closing the right part, we must be at a position i such that i <= r (so that i+1 <= r+1) but we don't want to close any tab from l to r. So we must be at i = r, then we close from r+1 to b (which is n).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that we close one entire side at a time. We can do multiple moves and multiple closures. But the above two strategies are the natural ways.\n\n But wait, are there other possibilities?\n\n Consider: sometimes we might not need to move the cursor to the very end of the segment for the closure? Actually, for closing the left part, we must be at the leftmost tab of the desired segment (l) so that we don't close any tab of the desired segment. Similarly, for the right part, we must be at the rightmost tab (r). However, note that we might be able to close the left part from a position greater than l? Actually, no: because if we are at a position i > l, then when we close the left part, we close from a to i-1. Since i-1 >= l (if i>l) then we would close the tab l as well (because l <= i-1). That is not allowed. So we must be at l to close the left part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n Similarly, for the right part, we must be at r (so that we close from r+1 to n, and not from i+1 to n which would leave some tabs in the desired segment if i < r? Actually, if we are at a position i < r, then we close from i+1 to n. This would close the desired segment from i+1 to r-1 (if i+1 <= r-1) which we don't want. Therefore, we must be at r to close the right part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n Therefore, the two strategies above are the only two ways (if we have to close both sides).\n\n Now, what if we don't have to close one side?\n\n Case 3: If the desired segment is the entire left part (i.e., r == n) then we only need to close the left part (if l > 1) but wait: actually, if r==n, then we don't need to close the right part. But we still might need to close the left part. Similarly, if l==1, we don't need to close the left part.\n\n However, note: the problem asks to leave only [l, r]. So if l==1, then we don't have any tab to the left to close (because the left part is empty). Similarly, if r==n, then we don't have any tab to the right to close.\n\n Therefore:\n\n  - If l == 1 and r == n: 0 seconds.\n\n  - Else if l == 1: then we only need to close the right part. How?\n        We are at `pos`. We can move to r (if we are not already at r) and then close the right part. But note: we might be able to close the right part without moving if we are at a position >= r? Actually, to close the right part we must be at r (so that we don't close any desired tab). So we have to get to r.\n\n        Steps: \n          Move from `pos` to r: |pos - r| moves.\n          Then close the right part: 1 second.\n\n        Total: |pos - r| + 1.\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at r? Then we can just close the right part without moving? Actually, yes. So the number of moves is |pos - r|.\n\n  - Else if r == n: then we only need to close the left part.\n        Steps:\n          Move from `pos` to l: |pos - l| moves.\n          Then close the left part: 1 second.\n\n        Total: |pos - l| + 1.\n\n  - Else (both sides need to be closed): then we have two strategies. We can do:\n\n        Option 1: Close left then right: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1 = |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2.\n        Option 2: Close right then left: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 = |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2.\n\n        But note: |l-r| = |r-l|, so the two options are symmetric.\n\n        However, we might be able to combine the movements. But note: after closing one side, the boundaries change. But in our calculation, we are using the absolute differences which account for the movement in the fixed initial configuration. But wait: after closing one side, the available tabs change. However, we are forced to move to the boundary of the desired segment (l for left closure, r for right closure). The movement is independent of the closure because we can move freely (until we hit the boundaries, but initially we have the full range so the movement from any starting point to l is |pos-l| and similarly for r).\n\n        But note: if we close the left part first, then the boundaries become [l, n]. Then when we move from l to r, we are now in a system with boundaries [l, n]. But the distance from l to r is still |l - r|, so that part is unchanged.\n\n        Therefore, we take the minimum of the two strategies? Actually, the two strategies yield the same total if we consider the absolute values? Not necessarily: because |pos-l| and |pos-r| might be different.\n\n        Actually, we have two distinct ways:\n\n          Strategy1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n          Strategy2: |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n        And since |l-r| = |r-l|, we just compare |pos-l| and |pos-r|.\n\n        So the minimal total for two-sided closure is min(|pos-l| + |l-r| + 2, |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2) = |l-r| + 2 + min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|)\n\n        However, wait: let me reexamine. Actually, the two strategies are:\n\n          Strategy1: \n            Step1: Move from pos to l: |pos-l|\n            Step2: Close left: 1\n            Step3: Move from l to r: |l-r|\n            Step4: Close right: 1\n\n          Strategy2:\n            Step1: Move from pos to r: |pos-r|\n            Step2: Close right: 1\n            Step3: Move from r to l: |r-l| (same as |l-r|)\n            Step4: Close left: 1\n\n        So the total for Strategy1 is |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2.\n        For Strategy2: |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2.\n\n        So the minimal is the minimum between these two.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: we must make two closures (each taking 1 second) and we must traverse from the starting position to the two boundaries (l and r). But note: we can choose the order. We have to cover both boundaries. The minimal way is to go from the start to one boundary and then to the other.\n\n        The minimal distance to cover both l and r from pos is: \n          min( |pos-l| + |l-r|, |pos-r| + |l-r| ) + 2\n\n        But note: the above is the same as |l-r| + min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|) + ... wait no, because the two terms are |pos-l| + |l-r| and |pos-r| + |l-r|, so the minimal is |l-r| + min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|) plus the two closure operations (which are fixed at 2). \n\n        However, wait: in the two strategies, the total operations are:\n\n          Strategy1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n          Strategy2: |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2\n\n        So the minimal is min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|) + |l-r| + 2.\n\n        Example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 (from the example)\n\n          |pos-l| = |3-2| = 1\n          |pos-r| = |3-4| = 1\n          |l-r| = 2\n\n          Then minimal two-sided strategy: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n        The example input says output 5.\n\n        But wait, the example input is \"6 3 2 4\", and the example solution says 5.\n\n        Another example: Input \"6 3 1 3\"\n\n          Here, l=1, so we are in the case of only closing the right part.\n\n          Steps: \n            Move from 3 to 3 (since r=3) -> 0 moves, then close the right part: 1 second -> total 1.\n\n          But the example output is 1.\n\n        However, note: the example input is \"6 3 1 3\", so we have to leave [1,3]. The right part is from 4 to 6. We are at 3, so we can close the right part without moving. So 1 second.\n\n        Another example: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n        Now, let's test the two-sided case with an asymmetric starting position.\n\n        Example: n=10, pos=7, l=2, r=9.\n\n          Two-sided: \n            Strategy1: |7-2| + |2-9| + 2 = 5 + 7 + 2 = 14.\n            Strategy2: |7-9| + |9-2| + 2 = 2 + 7 + 2 = 11.\n\n          So minimal is 11.\n\n        But wait, is 11 correct?\n\n          Steps for Strategy2 (closing right then left):\n            Start at 7.\n            Move to 9: 2 moves (right two steps).\n            Close right: 1 second -> now the tabs are [1,9] (but wait, we want to leave [2,9]? Actually, no: we started with [1,10] and closed the right part from 10 to 10 (if we were at 9, then we close [10,10]). Then the tabs become [1,9]. Now we need to close the left part (from 1 to 1). So we must move the cursor from 9 to 2 (so 7 moves) and then close the left part.\n\n            Total: 2 (move to 9) + 1 (close right) + 7 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) = 11.\n\n        Alternatively, we could consider: maybe we don't have to go all the way to 2? Actually, to close the left part, we must be at the tab 2 (so that we close from 1 to 1). So yes, we must be at 2.\n\n        Now, is there a better way? What if we close the left part first?\n\n          Steps for Strategy1 (closing left then right):\n            Start at 7.\n            Move to 2: 5 moves (left 5 steps).\n            Close left: 1 second -> now the tabs are [2,10]. Then we have to close the right part. To close the right part (from 10 to 10) we must be at 9 (so we can close [10,10]). So move from 2 to 9: 7 moves, then close: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 5 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 14.\n\n        So the minimal is indeed 11.\n\n        Therefore, the solution:\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n:\n              print(0)\n          elif l == 1:\n              # Only close the right part\n              print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n          elif r == n:\n              # Only close the left part\n              print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n          else:\n              # Both sides need to be closed\n              option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n              option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n              print(min(option1, option2))\n\n        But wait: in the two-sided case, we are adding the two closure operations (each 1 second). \n\n        However, note: in the one-sided case, we are only doing one closure operation and the movement to the boundary.\n\n        But let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"6 3 2 4\" -> n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 -> two-sided.\n          option1 = |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n          option2 = |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 -> min(5,5)=5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"6 3 1 3\" -> one-sided (l==1, r=3 != n) -> \n          print(abs(3-3)+1) = 0+1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"5 2 1 5\" -> one-sided (l==1, r==5 and n=5 -> so r==n) -> \n          Actually, in our condition: \n            if l==1 and r==n: then 0.\n            else if l==1: then use the right part.\n            else if r==n: then use the left part.\n\n          Here, l==1 and r==5 and n==5 -> so we hit the first condition: 0.\n\n        However, wait: the input is \"5 2 1 5\", so l=1, r=5, n=5 -> so we don't need to do anything. Correct.\n\n        But what about the case when the desired segment is the entire set? We have the first condition.\n\n        Another edge: what if the desired segment is [l, r] and the cursor is already at l or r? \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=2, l=2, r=9 (one-sided, only close the right part). \n          Steps: we are at 2, and we need to move to 9 (|2-9|=7) and then close the right part (1 second). Total 8.\n\n        But wait, is there a possibility to close the right part without moving? No, because we are at 2, and to close the right part we must be at 9 (so that we close from 10 to 10). \n\n        However, note: the operation to close the right part is defined as closing all the tabs to the right of the cursor. So if we are at 2, then we close from 3 to 10? That is, we close the entire right part (including the desired part [2,9] from 3 to 9). That is not allowed.\n\n        Correction: We must not close the desired segment. Therefore, we must be at the boundary of the desired segment (r) to close the right part. Similarly, for the left part we must be at l.\n\n        Therefore, our conditions and calculations are correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the desired segment is [l, r] and we are already at the boundary? \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=9, l=2, r=9 (two-sided). Then:\n\n          Strategy1: |9-2| + |2-9| + 2 = 7 + 7 + 2 = 16.\n          Strategy2: |9-9| + |9-2| + 2 = 0 + 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n        Steps for Strategy2: \n          Start at 9.\n          Close the right part: we are at 9, so we can close the right part (tabs 10) -> 1 second. Now the tabs are [1,9].\n          Then we must close the left part. We are at 9, so we must move to 2 (7 moves) and then close (1 second). \n          Total: 0 (for moving to close right) + 7 (moving to 2) + 1 (close left) = 8? \n\n        Wait, I see: the closure operation counts as 1 second, and the movement counts separately.\n\n        Actually, the two operations (closing) are 1 second each. In Strategy2, we did two closures? Actually, no: we have two sides to close. But note: we are closing the right part first (which is one closure) and then the left part (another closure). So the two closures are two seconds.\n\n        But wait: the above breakdown for Strategy2 in the two-sided case is:\n\n          Step1: Move from pos to r (if we are closing the right first) -> |pos-r| moves.\n          Step2: Close the right part: 1 second.\n          Step3: Move from r to l: |r-l| moves.\n          Step4: Close the left part: 1 second.\n\n        So for the example: \n          Step1: |9-9| = 0 moves.\n          Step2: 1 second.\n          Step3: |9-2| = 7 moves.\n          Step4: 1 second.\n\n        Total: 0 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 9 seconds.\n\n        But note: the example I thought above: \"Close the right part: we are at 9, so we can close the right part (tabs 10)\" -> that is correct and takes 1 second. Then we have to move to 2 (7 moves) and then close the left part (1 second). So 9 seconds.\n\n        However, wait: after closing the right part, the boundaries change. Now the tabs are from 1 to 9, and the cursor is at 9. Then we move from 9 to 2: that's 7 moves (each move one tab). Then we close the left part (from 1 to 1) which is 1 second.\n\n        But note: the problem states that when closing the left part, the operation closes the segment [a, i-1] where a is the current minimum index (which is 1). So we must be at 2 to avoid closing the desired segment [2,9]. \n\n        Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we are already at the left boundary (l)? Then in the two-sided case, if we choose to close the left part first, we don't need to move to l (if we are already there). Then we close the left part (1 second) and then move to r (|l-r|) and then close the right part (1 second). \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=2, l=2, r=9 (two-sided). \n          Strategy1: \n            Step1: |2-2|=0 moves.\n            Step2: close left -> 1 second (now tabs from 2 to 10)\n            Step3: move from 2 to 9: 7 moves.\n            Step4: close right: 1 second.\n            Total: 0+1+7+1 = 9.\n\n          Strategy2:\n            Step1: |2-9|=7 moves.\n            Step2: close right: 1 second (now tabs from 1 to 9)\n            Step3: move from 9 to 2: 7 moves.\n            Step4: close left: 1 second.\n            Total: 7+1+7+1 = 16.\n\n        So the minimal is 9.\n\n        This matches our formula: \n          option1 = |2-2| + |2-9| + 2 = 0 + 7 + 2 = 9\n          option2 = |2-9| + |9-2| + 2 = 7 + 7 + 2 = 16\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          Read the input: n, pos, l, r\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n:\n              print(0)\n          elif l == 1:\n              print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n          elif r == n:\n              print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n          else:\n              option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n              option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n              print(min(option1, option2))\n\n        However, wait: in the one-sided cases, what if the cursor is already at the boundary? \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=9, l=1, r=9 (so one-sided, only close left). \n          Steps: we are at 9, we need to close the left part. To close the left part, we must be at 1. So we must move from 9 to 1 (8 moves) and then close (1 second). Total 9.\n\n        But according to the code: \n          Since l==1, then we use the right part? No, wait: the condition is \"elif l==1\", but note: if l==1, then we are only concerned with the right part? \n\n        Correction: The condition \"elif l==1\" is for the case when we don't need to close the left part (because l==1, so there's no left part to close) and we only need to close the right part (if r != n). \n\n        In this example, we have l==1 and r==9 (and n=10, so r != n). So we use the one-sided right part closure.\n\n        But wait, the example has l==1 and r!=n, so we are in the one-sided right part closure. However, the example actually requires closing the left part? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          We want to leave [1,9]. \n          Initially, we have [1,10]. \n          We need to close the right part (from 10 to 10) and also the left part? No, because l==1, so there's no left part to close. Only the right part.\n\n        However, the example says: we are at 9. We want to close the right part. We must be at 9 (which we are) and then we can close the right part (from 10 to 10). So we only need 1 second.\n\n        But wait, the example input: n=10, pos=9, l=1, r=9.\n\n        Our code: \n          Condition1: l==1 and r==n? -> 9==10? no.\n          Condition2: l==1 -> yes, so we do: abs(9-9)+1 = 0+1 = 1.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example I described above was actually a two-sided closure? \n\n        Actually, no: the desired segment is [1,9]. We have to close the right part (10) but not the left part (because 1 is included). So it's one-sided (only right).\n\n        Now, what if the desired segment is [1,9] and the cursor is at 10? \n          Then we are at 10, and we must close the right part? Actually, no: because the desired segment is [1,9] and we are at 10 (which is outside). But note: the problem says the cursor starts at a tab that is currently opened. Initially, we have all tabs. Then we close some. But the problem doesn't say that the cursor must remain on an open tab. However, the movement is defined as: from i to max(i-1, a) or min(i+1, b). Initially, a=1, b=n. So if we are at 10, then we can move to 9 (then close the right part) or to 1 (then close the left part) but wait: we don't need to close the left part. \n\n        But note: the condition for one-sided is that we only need to close the right part. However, if we are at 10, then we are not at the boundary (r=9). We must move from 10 to 9 (1 move) and then close the right part (1 second). Total 2.\n\n        According to our code: \n          Input: n=10, pos=10, l=1, r=9.\n          Condition1: 1==1 and 9==10 -> false.\n          Condition2: l==1 -> true, so we do: abs(10-9)+1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the desired segment is [2,9] (so l=2, r=9) and the cursor is at 10? \n          Then we are in two-sided closure (l!=1 and r!=n). \n          Steps: \n            We must close the left part (from 1 to 1) and the right part (from 10 to 10). \n\n            We are at 10. \n            Option1: \n                Move from 10 to 2: 8 moves, then close left (1 sec) -> now the tabs are [2,10]. Then move from 2 to 9: 7 moves, then close right (1 sec). Total: 8+1+7+1 = 17.\n            Option2:\n                Move from 10 to 9: 1 move, then close right (1 sec) -> now the tabs are [1,9]. Then move from 9 to 2: 7 moves, then close left (1 sec). Total: 1+1+7+1 = 10.\n\n          Our code: \n            option1 = |10-2| + |2-9| + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17\n            option2 = |10-9| + |9-2| + 2 = 1 + 7 + 2 = 10.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that the cursor must stay within the open tabs. But the movement is defined with the current boundaries (a and b). Initially, the boundaries are [1, n]. After closing, the boundaries change. But our movement calculations are based on absolute differences, which are independent of the boundaries? \n\n        But wait: when we move, we are constrained by the current boundaries. However, the problem says: \n          - Each second, we can move the cursor to the left to max(i-1, a) or to the right to min(i+1, b).\n\n        In the two-sided closure, we are breaking the problem into two independent movements: from the start to l (or r) and then from l to r (or r to l). \n\n        But note: the boundaries change after each closure. However, the distance from the current position to the target (l or r) is fixed because the target positions (l and r) are fixed and the movement is along the integer tabs. The absolute difference in indices is the same regardless of the current boundaries? \n\n        Actually, the movement is constrained by the current boundaries, but the desired segment [l, r] is fixed. The boundaries after the first closure will be [l, n] (if we close the left) or [1, r] (if we close the right). But note: the movement from the start to l: initially the boundaries are [1, n] so we can move freely from the start to l (as long as we don't jump over the boundaries, but we move one by one). Similarly, the movement from l to r: after closing the left, the boundaries become [l, n] and we are at l, so we can move to r (which is within [l, n]) without being blocked.\n\n        Therefore, the absolute differences are valid.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Note: the input is given in one line with four integers.\n\n        Example: \"6 3 2 4\"\n\n        We read:\n          n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n        Then apply the above logic.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing different cases based on the relationship between the cursor position and the desired segment [l, r].\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires minimizing the time taken to close tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (one tab per second) and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one second per operation). The key observation is that closing operations must be performed from the boundaries of the desired segment to avoid closing any tabs within the segment.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Case 1**: If the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already the desired segment (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), no operations are needed.\n   - **Case 2**: If only the left part needs closing (i.e., l == 1 but r < n), move the cursor to the right boundary (r) and close the right tabs.\n   - **Case 3**: If only the right part needs closing (i.e., r == n but l > 1), move the cursor to the left boundary (l) and close the left tabs.\n   - **Case 4**: If both parts need closing, compute the minimal time by considering two strategies: closing the left part first or the right part first. The minimal time is derived from the smaller of the two strategies.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward conditional checks to determine which case applies and then calculates the minimal time based on the cursor's initial position and the segment boundaries.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks, resulting in a constant time complexity O(1), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    elif l == 1:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    elif r == n:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Case 1 (l == 1 and r == n)**: No tabs need closing, so the answer is 0.\n- **Case 2 (l == 1)**: Only the right part needs closing. The time is calculated as the distance from the cursor to the right boundary (r) plus one second for the closure.\n- **Case 3 (r == n)**: Only the left part needs closing. The time is the distance from the cursor to the left boundary (l) plus one second for the closure.\n- **Case 4 (both parts need closing)**: Two strategies are considered:\n  - **Option 1**: Move to the left boundary (l), close left tabs, move to the right boundary (r), and close right tabs.\n  - **Option 2**: Move to the right boundary (r), close right tabs, move to the left boundary (l), and close left tabs.\n  The minimal time between these two options is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is computed with optimal operations.",
