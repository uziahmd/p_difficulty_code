Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Conditions:\n   Two vouchers i and j must have total duration = x (i.e., (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x)\n   They must not intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   We want the minimal total cost.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1) be the duration of voucher i.\n\n 2. We note that we need two vouchers with durations a and b such that a+b = x.\n\n 3. We can group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we will store the vouchers (each represented by (l, r, cost)) that have duration d.\n\n 4. But note: we also need to check non-overlapping condition. The condition is that the intervals do not overlap: so if we have two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2], then either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n 5. How to efficiently find the best pair? \n\n    Idea:\n        We are going to consider all pairs of durations (d, x-d) and then for each duration d, we have a list of vouchers (with their intervals and costs).\n\n        However, note: the total number of distinct durations might be up to 200000 (since li, ri up to 200000) but note that n is up to 200000, so the distinct durations might be fewer.\n\n        But we cannot iterate over every pair of durations and then every voucher in each group because the groups might be large.\n\n 6. Alternate approach:\n\n    We are only interested in pairs (voucher i, voucher j) such that d_i + d_j = x and they don't overlap.\n\n    We can precompute:\n\n        Let's create an array for each duration from 1 to max_duration (which is at most 200000). But note: x can be up to 200000, and durations are between 1 and 200000.\n\n        However, the problem is that we have to check non-overlapping condition.\n\n 7. Another idea:\n\n        Instead, we can think: For each voucher i (with duration d_i), we want to find a voucher j (with duration d_j = x - d_i) such that the two intervals do not overlap.\n\n        Then, we want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n        So, for each voucher i, we can look for the best candidate voucher j (from the set of vouchers with duration x-d_i) that does not overlap with voucher i and has minimal cost.\n\n        But how to check non-overlap quickly?\n\n        Conditions for non-overlap with [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]:\n            Condition1: r1 < l2\n            Condition2: r2 < l1\n\n        Since we are considering two sets (for duration d_i and x-d_i), we can preprocess the set of vouchers for each duration.\n\n        However, the challenge is that the same duration might appear multiple times and we have two different durations to consider.\n\n 8. Let's break down:\n\n        We'll create a dictionary (or list) `by_duration` that maps duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with duration d.\n\n        Then, for each voucher i (with duration d_i), we look at the set of vouchers with duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\n        But we cannot iterate over all vouchers in the set of duration d_j for each voucher i (because the set might be large and there are up to 200000 vouchers).\n\n 9. We need to optimize the query: given a query voucher (l1, r1) and a set S (vouchers of duration d_j), find a voucher (l2, r2) in S such that (r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1) and the cost is as small as possible.\n\n        Actually, we can split the condition:\n\n        Condition1: r1 < l2   -> then the first voucher ends before the second starts.\n        Condition2: r2 < l1   -> then the second voucher ends before the first starts.\n\n        So we are looking for two types of candidates:\n\n            Type1: Any voucher in S that starts after r1 (so l2 > r1). Among these, we want the one with minimal cost.\n            Type2: Any voucher in S that ends before l1 (so r2 < l1). Among these, we want the one with minimal cost.\n\n        Then the candidate for voucher i would be the minimal cost between the best candidate of Type1 and Type2.\n\n        Then we update our answer with (cost_i + min_cost_candidate) if both types exist.\n\n 10. How to quickly query for the minimal cost voucher in S that satisfies:\n\n        Condition for Type1: l2 > r1  -> we want the minimal cost among all vouchers in S with l2 > r1.\n        Condition for Type2: r2 < l1  -> we want the minimal cost among all vouchers in S with r2 < l1.\n\n    We can preprocess each set S (for a fixed duration d_j) by:\n\n        Option1: Sort the set S by l (for Type1) and by r (for Type2). But note: we have two different conditions.\n\n        Actually, we can preprocess two structures for each duration d_j:\n\n            Structure1: keyed by l (the start day) and we want to quickly get the minimum cost for any voucher in S with l >= some value (for Type1: l > r1, so we want the minimal cost for vouchers with l in (r1, ∞))\n\n            Structure2: keyed by r (the end day) and we want to quickly get the minimum cost for any voucher in S with r <= some value (for Type2: r < l1, so we want the minimal cost for vouchers with r in (-∞, l1-1])\n\n        But note: we cannot build two separate structures for each duration d_j if we have many distinct durations (up to 200000) because building a sorted list and then doing binary search for each query might be heavy.\n\n        However, note that the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of sizes of all sets is 200000. But the distinct durations might be up to 200000, so each set might be very small (on average, 1) but worst-case one duration could have many vouchers.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For each distinct duration d, let L[d] = sorted list of (l, r, cost) for that duration, but we don't need all three. We can separate:\n\n                For Type1: we want to index by l (to quickly find the minimal cost for l > some value)\n                For Type2: we want to index by r (to quickly find the minimal cost for r < some value)\n\n        However, note: the minimal cost in the entire set for Type1 condition might be found by having a separate array for each duration d:\n\n            Let for duration d:\n                arr_l[d] = sorted list of (l, cost) for that duration, but then we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l > X.\n\n            Similarly, arr_r[d] = sorted list of (r, cost) for that duration, and then we want the minimal cost for any voucher with r < X.\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            For each duration d, we can create:\n                events_by_start[d] = sorted list of (l, cost) for all vouchers with duration d. Then we can do: \n                    We are interested in the minimal cost for l in (X, ∞). We can also precompute an array for the minimal cost from the right for the sorted l? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree? But note, the constraints on l and r are up to 200000, and we have up to 200000 distinct durations, but the total number of vouchers is 200000.\n\n        But wait, we don't need to do range queries by the actual l and r values for each distinct duration separately. Instead, we can combine the queries by processing the entire set of vouchers once and then using two dictionaries for the entire set? \n\n        However, note: we are grouping by duration, and for each duration we have a set of vouchers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reframe the problem: we are only going to consider pairs (d, x-d). And we have to consider each voucher i (which gives duration d_i) and then look into the set for duration x-d_i.\n\n        Since the total number of vouchers is 200000, and the total distinct durations might be up to 200000, but the sum of the sizes of all sets is 200000, we can process each set for a given duration by:\n\n            Precompute for each duration d:\n                Let A[d] = sorted list of (l, r, cost) for that duration. But actually, for Type1 and Type2, we don't need the entire tuple.\n\n            For Type1: we want to know the minimal cost among all vouchers in A[d] that have l > X (where X = r1, from the first voucher).\n            For Type2: we want to know the minimal cost among all vouchers in A[d] that have r < X (where X = l1, from the first voucher).\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For a fixed duration d, we can:\n\n                Build two arrays:\n                    starts = sorted(set of l for this duration) and then we can create an array of costs and then do a suffix minimum array for starts (so that for each start value, we know the minimal cost for any voucher with start >= current start). But note: we want l > X, so we can take the minimal cost for l > X.\n\n                Similarly, for the other condition: Build an array of ends = sorted(set of r for this duration) and then a prefix minimum array for the minimal cost for r <= some value.\n\n        However, the problem is that we have to do this for each distinct duration d, and the total memory might be too high (if we store two arrays per distinct duration, and the distinct durations might be 200000, but note: the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the distinct durations cannot exceed 200000, but the number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but each voucher is counted once). But the worst-case, we have 200000 distinct durations, then each set has one voucher. Then we can build two arrays of size 1 for each. \n\n        Steps for one duration d:\n\n            Let list_d = [(l1, r1, c1), (l2, r2, c2), ...]\n\n            For Type1 (query by l): \n                We want to quickly get the minimal cost for any voucher with l > X.\n\n                We can sort by l. Then, we can create an array of the minimal cost from the last element backwards.\n\n                Example: \n                    Sort by l: [(l0, r0, c0), (l1, r1, c1), ...] with l0 <= l1 <= ...\n                    Then, we can do:\n                        min_cost_from_right[i] = min(costs from i to end)\n\n                Then, we do a binary search for the first index where l > X, then the minimal cost is min_cost_from_right[index].\n\n            Similarly for Type2 (query by r):\n                Sort by r: [(r0, l0, c0), (r1, l1, c1), ...] with r0 <= r1 <= ...\n                Then, we can do a prefix minimum array: min_cost_from_left[i] = min(costs from 0 to i)\n\n            But note: we are storing the same set of vouchers twice (once by l and once by r). However, we are allowed because the total number of vouchers is 200000.\n\n        However, note: we have to store the entire set of vouchers for each duration d, and then build two sorted lists (one by l and one by r) for each d. The total memory and time is O(total_vouchers) which is acceptable (n=200000).\n\n        But wait: the distinct durations might be many, but the total vouchers is 200000, so the total memory is about 2 * 200000 * (size of a tuple) which is acceptable.\n\n 11. Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read input.\n\n        Step 2: Create a dictionary `duration_dict` that maps duration d to a list of tuples (l, r, cost). Also, we need to compute d = r-l+1.\n\n        Step 3: For each duration d that appears, we build two structures:\n\n            Structure1 (for Type1): \n                Sort the list by l (the start day).\n                Then, from the sorted list, create an array `min_cost_from_right` such that:\n                    Let sorted_list = sorted(original_list, key=lambda x: x[0])  # x[0] is l\n                    Then, create an array `suffix_min` of length = len(sorted_list)\n                    suffix_min[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n            Structure2 (for Type2):\n                Sort the list by r (the end day).\n                Then, create an array `prefix_min` such that:\n                    sorted_list2 = sorted(original_list, key=lambda x: x[1])  # x[1] is r\n                    prefix_min[i] = minimum cost from index 0 to i.\n\n        Step 4: Now, for each voucher i (which we will iterate over all n vouchers), we do:\n\n            d_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n            d_j = x - d_i\n\n            If d_j < 0, skip.\n\n            Check if d_j exists in the dictionary.\n\n            Then, we consider two types of non-overlap:\n\n                Type1: Condition: r_i < l_j. Then we need to find a voucher j in duration_dict[d_j] such that l_j > r_i.\n\n                    Use the structure for duration_dict[d_j] built by 'l': \n                        In the sorted list (by l) of duration_dict[d_j], we want the smallest index such that l_j > r_i.\n\n                    Then, if there is at least one, we get the minimal cost from the suffix_min array at that index.\n\n                Type2: Condition: r_j < l_i. Then we need to find a voucher j in duration_dict[d_j] such that r_j < l_i.\n\n                    Use the structure for duration_dict[d_j] built by 'r':\n                        In the sorted list (by r) of duration_dict[d_j], we want the largest index such that r_j < l_i.\n\n                    Then, if there is at least one, we get the minimal cost from the prefix_min array at that index.\n\n            Then, the candidate cost for this voucher i is the minimal cost from Type1 and Type2 (if both exist, then we take the minimum of the two; if one doesn't exist, then we take the one that exists). Then we add the cost of voucher i.\n\n            Then, update the global answer with the minimal total cost.\n\n        Step 5: However, note: we are iterating over each voucher i and querying the set for duration d_j. This would be O(n * log(size of set for d_j)). Since the total distinct durations is at most 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000, and the worst-case for a single set might be large, but note: the total work is the sum_{i} [log(|set_d_j|)] which is O(n * log(n)) because the total number of vouchers is n.\n\n        But note: we are building two structures for each distinct duration d, and the total memory and time for building these structures is O(total_vouchers) because each voucher is processed once for each duration it belongs to (but each voucher belongs to one duration). Actually, we are building the structures per distinct duration, and the total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the building step is O(total_vouchers * log(total_vouchers)) which is acceptable.\n\n 12. But wait: what if the same duration appears many times? Then the set for that duration is large, but we are building the structure only once per distinct duration. Then the query for that set is efficient (O(log(size)) per query). \n\n 13. However, note: we are iterating over all vouchers (n up to 200000). For each voucher, we do two binary searches (each O(log(size(d_j))) and then look up the minimal cost from the precomputed array. \n\n        Total operations: 200000 * 2 * log(max_size_of_set). The maximum set size is at most 200000 (if all vouchers have the same duration, then we have one set of 200000). Then log(200000) is about 18, so 200000*2*18 = 7.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n 14. Edge: if the set for duration d_j does not exist, then skip.\n\n 15. Also, note: we must consider that the same voucher might appear twice? The problem says \"two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\", but note that two different vouchers can have the same duration. However, we are storing by duration, so if two vouchers have the same duration, they are stored together. But we must avoid using the same voucher twice? \n\n        However, note: the problem requires two distinct vouchers. But when we consider a voucher i and then look for a voucher j in the same duration set (if d_i = d_j) then we are allowed to pick two different vouchers from the same set. But we must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct. \n\n        However, when we built the set for a duration, we included all vouchers with that duration. Then, when we query for a voucher i (with duration d_i) and we look for a voucher j (with duration d_j) and if d_i == d_j, then we are including all vouchers in that duration (including possibly the same voucher i). But wait: the condition for non-overlap must hold, and also we require two distinct vouchers.\n\n        How to avoid using the same voucher? \n\n        Note: In our query, we are looking at the entire set of vouchers of duration d_j. The set includes the voucher i if and only if d_i == d_j. So we have to make sure that when d_i == d_j, we do not pick the voucher i itself.\n\n        However, the problem does not say that the two vouchers must be distinct by index, but by the fact that they are two different vouchers. But note: the input may contain duplicate vouchers (same l, r, cost). \n\n        But the problem states: two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j). So they are distinct by index.\n\n        Therefore, even if two vouchers are identical, they are considered distinct if they are different indices.\n\n        However, we are storing by duration. So if two vouchers have the same duration, they are in the same set. Then when we query for a voucher i (which is in the set for duration d_i) and d_i = d_j, then the set for d_j includes voucher i. Then we might match voucher i with itself? \n\n        Condition: non-overlap. But the problem requires two distinct vouchers. We must avoid matching a voucher with itself.\n\n        How? We cannot simply remove the current voucher from the set for d_i when d_i = d_j, because the set is built from the entire input and we are iterating over all vouchers.\n\n        Alternative: We can leave the set unchanged, but when querying for voucher i, we must not consider the voucher i itself if it is in the set for d_j (i.e., if d_i == d_j). \n\n        However, note: the set for d_j contains all vouchers with duration d_j, including voucher i if d_i = d_j. Then, we must not choose the same voucher i again.\n\n        But the condition for non-overlap: if voucher i is taken, then we cannot use it again. But note: the non-overlap condition is independent. However, we are storing the entire set. \n\n        How to handle?\n\n            We can do nothing and then hope that the non-overlap condition fails for the same voucher? \n\n            Consider: if we have a voucher i, and we try to match it with itself (if d_i = d_j and d_j = x - d_i, then d_i = x/2). Then, the condition for non-overlap: \n                Condition1: r_i < l_i? (because for voucher i and j being the same, we require either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i, and since l_j = l_i and r_j = r_i, then r_i < l_i is false unless the interval is empty (which it isn't because duration>=1). Similarly, Condition2: r_i < l_i is the same. So the same voucher never satisfies non-overlap with itself.\n\n            Therefore, even if we include the same voucher, the condition fails. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) but different indices? Then, the non-overlap condition might hold? \n\n            Example: two vouchers [1,3,4] and [1,3,4]. Then, the two intervals are [1,3] and [1,3] -> they do overlap. So the condition fails.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to remove the current voucher from the set, because even if the set contains the current voucher, the non-overlap condition will fail for the same voucher (if we tried to use the same voucher) and also for two identical vouchers, the condition fails (unless the intervals are disjoint by chance, but if the intervals are identical then they are not disjoint). \n\n        But wait: what if we have two different vouchers (same duration) that are disjoint? Then the set contains both and we might match them. That's correct.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if we have two distinct vouchers with the same duration, then we are allowed to use them. And our method will consider them because they are in the set.\n\n        So no special removal is needed.\n\n 16. Algorithm:\n\n        Precomputation:\n            Read n, x.\n            Vouchers = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                read l, r, cost\n                d = r - l + 1\n                append (l, r, cost, d) to Vouchers\n\n            Build dictionary: \n                duration_dict = {}\n                for each voucher (l, r, cost, d):\n                    if d not in duration_dict:\n                        duration_dict[d] = []\n                    duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n            Then, for each duration d in duration_dict:\n                Let list_d = duration_dict[d]\n                Build two sorted lists and two arrays:\n\n                    By start (l): \n                        sorted_by_l = sorted(list_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        Then, we want to extract the l values and the costs, and then build a suffix minimum array for the costs.\n\n                    By end (r):\n                        sorted_by_r = sorted(list_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                        Then, we want to extract the r values and the costs, and then build a prefix minimum array for the costs.\n\n            However, note: we don't need the entire tuple for the suffix and prefix arrays, but we do need the entire tuple to know the l and r for the condition. Actually, we only need the minimal cost for the condition, but we also need to know the l and r for the condition? \n\n            Actually, in the query we are only using the set for the opposite duration. We built the set for duration d, and then for a given query (l1, r1) (from voucher i), we are checking:\n\n                Type1: We need to find a voucher in the set (for duration d) with l > r1. We don't care about the entire voucher, only the minimal cost and the l value (to compare). But we have stored the entire list.\n\n            We can build:\n\n                For duration d, we have two structures:\n\n                    Structure1 (for Type1): \n                        keys: the l's (start days) of the vouchers in this duration, sorted.\n                        We also want to know the minimal cost for vouchers with l >= some value. But note: we are storing the entire list. We can build:\n\n                            sorted_by_l = sorted(list_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            Then, we can create an array of the l's and an array of the costs. Then, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l > X.\n\n                    Similarly for Type2.\n\n            Alternatively, we can build two arrays for each duration d:\n\n                For Type1 (by l):\n                    Let L = sorted(set(l for (l, r, cost) in list_d))\n                    But we don't need the set, we need the entire list. We can do:\n\n                    sorted_by_l = sorted(list_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we can create an array of the l's: [l0, l1, ...] and an array of the costs: [c0, c1, ...] and then do:\n\n                    suffix_min[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                    Then, to query for a given X (which is r1 from voucher i), we find the first index pos such that sorted_by_l[i][0] > X. Then, if pos is within the array, the minimal cost is suffix_min[pos][0] (actually, we store the minimal cost from index pos to the end).\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                We'll build for each duration d:\n\n                    type1_sorted = sorted([(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we can create an array of the l's and an array of the same length for the minimal cost from the current index to the end.\n\n                    Similarly, for type2_sorted = sorted([(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_d], key=lambda x: x[0])  # here the key is r\n\n                Then, for a query (X) for type1 (l>X): \n                    Find the smallest index i such that type1_sorted[i][0] > X. Then the minimal cost from that index to the end is stored in an array `type1_suffix_min` where type1_suffix_min[i] = min(type1_sorted[i][1], type1_sorted[i+1][1], ...)\n\n                Similarly, for type2 (r < X): \n                    We have type2_sorted = sorted([(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_d], key=lambda x: x[0])   # now the key is r, so we sort by r\n                    Then, we can create an array `type2_prefix_min` where type2_prefix_min[i] = min(costs from 0 to i)\n\n                    Then, we find the largest index i such that type2_sorted[i][0] < X. Then the minimal cost is type2_prefix_min[i].\n\n            But note: in the type2_sorted, we are storing (r, cost) and we sort by r. Then, the condition is r < X.\n\n            How to find the largest index i such that type2_sorted[i][0] < X? \n\n                We can do a binary search for the last index where r < X.\n\n            Steps for building for a given duration d:\n\n                type1_data = sorted([(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                type2_data = sorted([(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_d], key=lambda x: 0)  # key by r\n\n                Then, for type1_data:\n                    We create an array `l_vals1` = [x[0] for x in type1_data]\n                    `costs1` = [x[1] for x in type1_data]\n                    Then, we build `suffix_min1` of length=len(type1_data) such that:\n                        suffix_min1[i] = min(costs1[i:])\n\n                For type2_data:\n                    We create an array `r_vals2` = [x[0] for x in type2_data]\n                    `costs2` = [x[1] for x in type2_data]\n                    Then, we build `prefix_min2` of length=len(type2_data) such that:\n                        prefix_min2[i] = min(costs2[:i+1])\n\n            Then, store for duration d: \n                type1_info = (l_vals1, suffix_min1)\n                type2_info = (r_vals2, prefix_min2)\n\n        Then, for each voucher (l1, r1, cost1, d1) in the original list:\n\n            d_j = x - d1\n\n            If d_j < 0: skip.\n\n            If d_j not in duration_dict: skip.\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                candidate1 = None   # from Type1: r1 < l_j\n                candidate2 = None   # from Type2: r_j < l1\n\n                # Query Type1: find minimal cost in the set for d_j with l_j > r1\n                if d_j in duration_dict:   # we already checked, but still\n                    # Get the type1_info for d_j\n                    l_arr, suffix_min_arr = type1_info[d_j]   # Actually, we haven't stored type1_info and type2_info per duration. We need to store them.\n\n                We need to store the type1 and type2 structures for each duration d.\n\n                Let me define:\n\n                    type1_structures = {}   # key: duration d, value: (list of l's, suffix_min array)\n                    type2_structures = {}   # key: duration d, value: (list of r's, prefix_min array)\n\n                Then, for each voucher i:\n\n                    d_j = x - d_i   (d_i = r_i - l_i + 1)\n\n                    If d_j not in type1_structures: then skip.\n\n                    Else, for Type1:\n                        l_arr, suffix_min_arr = type1_structures[d_j]\n                        # Find the first index pos in l_arr such that l_arr[pos] > r_i\n                        # Use bisect_right or bisect_left? \n                        # We want the first index where l_arr[i] > r_i -> so we can use bisect_right for r_i and then take the next index.\n\n                        import bisect\n                        pos = bisect.bisect_right(l_arr, r_i)   # returns the insertion position, which is the index of the first element > r_i? Actually, bisect_right returns the insertion position to maintain sorted order, and all values to the left are <= r_i. So the first index with value > r_i is at pos.\n\n                        Then, if pos < len(l_arr):\n                            candidate1 = suffix_min_arr[pos]\n\n                    Similarly, for Type2:\n\n                        r_arr, prefix_min_arr = type2_structures[d_j]\n                        # We want the last index where r_arr[i] < l_i\n                        pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(r_arr, l_i) - 1   # because bisect_left returns the first index >= l_i, so subtract one to get the last index < l_i.\n\n                        Then, if pos2 >= 0:\n                            candidate2 = prefix_min_arr[pos2]\n\n                    Then, the minimal cost from the set d_j for this voucher i is min(candidate1, candidate2) but we have to consider that one of them might not exist.\n\n                    Then, total_cost = cost_i + candidate   (if candidate is not None)\n\n                    Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, total_cost)\n\n        But wait: candidate1 and candidate2 are the minimal costs from the set d_j (excluding the current voucher i, but we don't have to because the set includes the current one but the non-overlap condition fails anyway). \n\n        However, note: the set d_j might contain the current voucher i (if d_i = d_j) but the condition for non-overlap fails, so it's okay.\n\n 17. But note: we are storing the entire set of vouchers for duration d_j, including the current one. Then, when we query, we are including the current one. However, the non-overlap condition must be satisfied, and if the current voucher i is in the set for d_j, then the condition for non-overlap fails (unless the current voucher i is not the same as the one we are matching, but wait: we are matching a voucher j from the set. The set includes the current voucher i, but the condition for non-overlap must hold. \n\n        However, the condition for non-overlap is defined by the two intervals. The current voucher i has interval [l1, r1] and the candidate voucher j has interval [l_j, r_j]. The condition is either r1 < l_j or r_j < l1. \n\n        If the candidate voucher j is the same as the current voucher i, then we have [l1, r1] and [l1, r1] -> then we require r1 < l1 (false) or r1 < l1 (false). So same voucher never matches. \n\n        But what if the candidate voucher j is another voucher with the same duration and same interval? Then the condition still fails. \n\n        However, what if we have two different vouchers (same duration) that are disjoint? Then the condition holds and we get the candidate.\n\n        So the algorithm is safe.\n\n 18. However, note: the same voucher might appear multiple times in the input? The problem does not say they are distinct. But we are storing by duration and then by the entire tuple. \n\n        Since the input has n vouchers, and we are storing each voucher as a separate element in the list for a duration, we are correctly handling duplicates.\n\n 19. Finally, if we found no candidate pair, output -1.\n\n 20. But note: we are iterating over each voucher and then querying the set for duration d_j. However, if the same pair of vouchers (i, j) is considered twice (once when i is the first and once when j is the first)? \n\n        Example: voucher i and j, then when we process i, we look for j in the set for d_j = x - d_i. Then when we process j, we look for i in the set for d_i = x - d_j. \n\n        But note: d_i + d_j = x, so d_j = x - d_i, and d_i = x - d_j. \n\n        However, the condition for non-overlap is symmetric? \n\n        Actually, the condition is symmetric: if [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are disjoint, then either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1. And the same condition applies when swapping i and j.\n\n        But note: we are adding the cost_i + cost_j, so we would count the same pair twice: once as (i, j) and once as (j, i). \n\n        However, we are updating the global answer with the minimal total cost. And if the same pair is considered twice, we are updating the answer with the same total cost. But that is okay because we are taking the minimum. \n\n        But wait: we are iterating over each voucher. Each pair (i, j) will be considered twice? \n\n            When i is processed: we consider j (if d_j = x-d_i) and then when j is processed: we consider i (if d_i = x-d_j). \n\n        But note: d_i + d_j = x, so d_j = x-d_i and d_i = x-d_j, so yes, the two conditions are symmetric.\n\n        Then, we are counting the same pair twice. \n\n        How to avoid double counting? \n\n        But note: the problem does not require to count the pair only once. We are just minimizing the total cost. And we are going to get the same total cost for (i, j) and (j, i). \n\n        However, we are storing the entire set for a duration, and the set includes both i and j. Then, when processing i, we get candidate j (if the non-overlap condition holds) and when processing j, we get candidate i (if the non-overlap condition holds). \n\n        But note: the non-overlap condition is symmetric. So if (i, j) is valid, then (j, i) is the same pair and valid.\n\n        However, we are updating the global answer with the same total cost. It doesn't matter because we are taking the minimum. \n\n        But we are updating twice with the same total cost, which is acceptable. However, we are doing twice the work.\n\n        To reduce the work, we can consider:\n\n            Only consider pairs (i, j) with i < j? \n\n        But then we cannot because the condition d_i + d_j = x might not be symmetric in terms of the set lookup.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid double counting by ensuring that we consider each unordered pair only once. But the problem does not specify order.\n\n        However, the problem does not require to output the pair, only the minimal total cost.\n\n        We can leave as is, because the worst-case total cost is the same and we are only updating the minimum.\n\n        But note: the same total cost might be updated twice, but",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting two non-overlapping vouchers where the sum of their durations is exactly `x`. The key challenge is efficiently checking non-overlapping conditions and minimizing the total cost without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each voucher, we can determine the required duration of the complementary voucher (i.e., `x - current_voucher_duration`). We then need to find the cheapest voucher from the complementary duration group that does not overlap with the current voucher. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers that could potentially pair with a given voucher.\n   - **Preprocessing for Efficient Queries**: For each duration group, we preprocess two sorted lists: one sorted by start day (`l`) and another by end day (`r`). Alongside these, we maintain suffix minimum arrays for the start-sorted list and prefix minimum arrays for the end-sorted list. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimal cost voucher that meets the non-overlapping condition.\n   - **Query Processing**: For each voucher, we compute the required complementary duration. Using binary search on the preprocessed lists, we find the minimal cost voucher from the complementary group that either starts after the current voucher ends or ends before the current voucher starts.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The preprocessing step involves sorting and building suffix/prefix arrays, which takes O(n log n) time. Each query operation involves binary searches and array lookups, contributing O(log k) per query, where k is the size of the complementary duration group. Overall, the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of O(n log n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space required is O(n) to store the grouped vouchers and their auxiliary arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); cost = int(next(it))\n        d = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, d))\n    \n    duration_dict = {}\n    for l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n        if d not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[d] = []\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    type1_structures = {}\n    type2_structures = {}\n    \n    for d, lst in duration_dict.items():\n        type1_list = sorted([(item[0], item[2]) for item in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        l_vals = [item[0] for item in type1_list]\n        costs = [item[1] for item in type1_list]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(type1_list)\n        if len(costs) == 0:\n            continue\n        suffix_min[-1] = costs[-1]\n        for i in range(len(type1_list)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(costs[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n        type1_structures[d] = (l_vals, suffix_min)\n        \n        type2_list = sorted([(item[1], item[2]) for item in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        r_vals = [item[0] for item in type2_list]\n        costs2 = [item[1] for item in type2_list]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(type2_list)\n        if len(costs2) == 0:\n            continue\n        prefix_min[0] = costs2[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(type2_list)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(costs2[i], prefix_min[i-1])\n        type2_structures[d] = (r_vals, prefix_min)\n    \n    best_ans = 10**18\n    \n    for l, r, cost_i, d_i in vouchers:\n        d_j = x - d_i\n        if d_j < 0:\n            continue\n            \n        candidate_total = None\n        \n        if d_j in type1_structures:\n            l_arr, suffix_min_arr = type1_structures[d_j]\n            pos = bisect.bisect_right(l_arr, r)\n            if pos < len(l_arr):\n                cand1 = suffix_min_arr[pos]\n                candidate_total = cand1\n                \n        if d_j in type2_structures:\n            r_arr, prefix_min_arr = type2_structures[d_j]\n            pos = bisect.bisect_left(r_arr, l)\n            if pos > 0:\n                cand2 = prefix_min_arr[pos-1]\n                if candidate_total is None or cand2 < candidate_total:\n                    candidate_total = cand2\n                    \n        if candidate_total is not None:\n            total_cost = cost_i + candidate_total\n            if total_cost < best_ans:\n                best_ans = total_cost\n                \n    if best_ans == 10**18:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration into a dictionary where each key is a duration and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, two structures are built:\n   - **Type1 Structure**: Sorted by start day (`l`) and a suffix minimum array to quickly find the cheapest voucher starting after a given day.\n   - **Type2 Structure**: Sorted by end day (`r`) and a prefix minimum array to quickly find the cheapest voucher ending before a given day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, the complementary duration is calculated. Using binary search on the preprocessed structures, the algorithm finds the cheapest voucher from the complementary group that does not overlap with the current voucher. The minimal total cost is updated accordingly.\n5. **Output**: The minimal total cost is printed if valid pairs are found; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution exists.",
