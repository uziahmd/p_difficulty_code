Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players, each making exactly n moves. In each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). Then that digit is erased from A.\n\n We want to assign each of the 2n moves to either Homer or Marge (so n moves for each) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 plus the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", meaning the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But note: The assignment of moves to players can be arbitrary as long as each player makes n moves. However, the catch is that the digits are taken in order from left to right.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the entire sequence of 2n digits be d0, d1, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n In the game, the players will take turns? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of turns. It only says \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move\". So we can choose arbitrarily which player takes which digit, as long as each takes n digits.\n\n However, note that the digits are taken from the leftmost of A and then the next, etc. So the digits are fixed in order.\n\n We have to assign each digit to one of the two players, with exactly n digits for each.\n\n The value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to Homer (in the order they were taken, i.e., the order of appearance in A).\n Similarly for S2.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is the sum of two numbers: \n   S1 = digit1 * 10^(k1) + digit2 * 10^(k2) + ... \n   S2 = digit1' * 10^(k1') + ... \n\n But note: the assignment of digits to players is independent, but the positions (i.e., the power of 10) depend on the order of taking.\n\n However, the key is: the digits are taken in the original order. So if we assign the j-th digit (from left to right) to a player, then that digit will be placed at a specific position in that player's number. Specifically, the first digit taken (the first one) will be the most significant (at the highest power of 10) for that player.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n   Possibilities: \n      Option 1: Assign the first two to Homer and the last two to Marge -> \"HHMM\"\n          S1 = 12, S2 = 34 -> total = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n      Option 2: Alternating starting with Homer: \"HMHM\"\n          S1 = 13, S2 = 24 -> total = 13+24 = 37.\n\n      Option 3: Alternating starting with Marge: \"MHHM\" (if we start with M, then the first move is M, then H, then H, then M? Actually, wait: we must have exactly n moves for each, so two moves for each. The total length is 4, so two H and two M. The sequences are all the ways to arrange two H and two M. But note: the problem says \"output any of them\".\n\n How to think:\n\n We are to assign each of the 2n digits to one of two players, with n per player.\n\n The total prize is the sum of the two numbers. Each digit d_i (which is a character) at the i-th position (0-indexed) will be multiplied by 10 raised to the power (number of digits that are assigned to that player after this digit). \n\n Specifically, if a player has k digits, then the first digit assigned by the player (in the order of the game) is multiplied by 10^(k-1), the next by 10^(k-2), etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: for a given assignment, the value for a player is:\n\n   Let the player get digits at positions i1, i2, ..., in (with i1 < i2 < ... < in). Then the value is:\n        d[i1] * 10^(n-1) + d[i2] * 10^(n-2) + ... + d[in] * 10^0.\n\n But note: the digits are taken in increasing index order. However, the assignment does not require that the indices are consecutive; we just assign the digits from left to right.\n\n However, the catch: the assignment must be done in the order of the digits. The first digit (index0) must be assigned to someone, then index1, etc.\n\n So we have to decide for each digit (from left to right) whether to assign it to Homer or Marge.\n\n We cannot change the order of the digits, so the digit at position i will be the (i+1)-th digit from the left.\n\n Now, how do we maximize the total prize?\n\n Note: The total prize is the sum of two numbers. Each digit is used in exactly one number (either S1 or S2). \n\n Let's break down the contribution of a digit at position i:\n\n   Let the digit be d_i (converted to integer).\n\n   If we assign d_i to Homer, then in Homer's number, this digit will be placed at a certain significance. Specifically, the number of digits that Homer will take after this one (including this one) is not fixed until we assign all. But note: we know that Homer will take n digits in total.\n\n   However, we can think in terms of the entire assignment. The total prize is:\n\n        S1 = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} [digit_j * 10^{n - (position_in_Homer)}]\n\n   But note: the position_in_Homer is the rank of the digit in the set of digits assigned to Homer. The first digit assigned to Homer (by time) is the most significant (power n-1) and the last is the least (power 0). Similarly for Marge.\n\n Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming. Since n is at most 18, so 2n <= 36, we can use DP with state (i, h) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n-1) and h is the number of digits already assigned to Homer (from 0 to n). Then we consider the next digit and assign it to either Homer (if h < n) or Marge (if we have already assigned n to Homer, then we must assign to Marge, but actually we can also assign to Marge as long as we haven't reached n for Marge? Actually, we must have exactly n for each, so we can assign to Homer only if h < n, and to Marge only if (2n - i) < n + 1? Actually, we need to keep track of both.\n\n Let dp[i][h][m] be too heavy because i from 0 to 36, h from 0 to 18, m from 0 to 18, and we have two more dimensions? Actually, note that h+m = i, so we can let h be the count for Homer and then Marge count is i - h. But we must ensure that we don't exceed n for either.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total prize we can achieve from the first i digits, with h digits assigned to Homer (and hence i-h to Marge)\n\n Then the recurrence:\n\n   For the i-th digit (0-indexed) we have two choices (if available):\n\n   Case 1: Assign to Homer. Then we add the digit to Homer's number. But what is the contribution of this digit?\n\n   The digit is d_i (a character, so convert to int). In Homer's number, if we assign the current digit, then this digit will be placed at the next available position (for Homer) which is the (h)th digit from the beginning (so the most significant digit in Homer's number is the first one, then second, etc.). Therefore, the value added by assigning d_i to Homer is d_i * (10^(n-1 - (h))? \n\n   Wait, no: because the entire Homer's number has n digits. When we assign a digit to Homer, we are building his number from left to right. The first digit he gets will be the most significant (multiplied by 10^(n-1)), the second by 10^(n-2)), etc. But note: we don't know the entire assignment until the end. However, the digit we are adding now will be the (h+1)-th digit for Homer? Actually, no: the assignment is sequential. The digit we assign now will be placed at the next available spot in the number, but the entire number's length is n. The exponent for a digit in Homer's number is determined by how many digits he will have after this one. \n\n   Actually, we can precompute the power for each digit based on the total number of digits that the player will eventually have. But that is not known until the end.\n\n   Alternate approach: we know that each player will have exactly n digits. Therefore, for Homer:\n\n        The first digit he gets (the earliest in the sequence) will be multiplied by 10^(n-1).\n        The last digit he gets will be multiplied by 10^0.\n\n   However, if we assign a digit at position i to Homer, then the remaining digits (after i) that we assign to Homer will be (n - h - 1) in total. But the power of 10 for the current digit is 10^( (number of digits we still have to assign for Homer) )? Actually, no: the current digit is the (h+1)-th digit for Homer, so it will be multiplied by 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n   But wait: if we have already assigned h digits to Homer, then the next digit assigned to Homer will be the (h+1)-th, and it will be the (n - (h+1))-th power (if we consider that the most significant is 10^(n-1) and the least is 10^0). \n\n   However, note: the entire number for Homer has n digits. The first digit (h=0) is multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second (h=1) is multiplied by 10^(n-2). The third (h=2) is multiplied by 10^(n-3). So yes, the digit assigned at the (h+1)-th step (if we are at the i-th digit and we assign to Homer) will be multiplied by 10^(n - h - 1).\n\n   Similarly for Marge: if we assign the digit at position i to Marge, then we must account for the fact that Marge will have (m) digits so far (where m = i - h, because the total digits assigned so far is i, and h for Homer, so i-h for Marge). Then the next digit for Marge (if we assign now) will be the (m+1)-th, so multiplied by 10^(n - m - 1).\n\n   However, wait: the assignment is interleaved. The digits are taken from left to right. The assignment to Marge might not be contiguous. But note: the entire Marge's number is built by the digits assigned to her, and the order is the same as in A. So the first digit she gets (the earliest in the sequence) is the most significant.\n\n   Therefore, the power for a digit assigned to a player depends on the total number of digits that player will have at the end, and the order in which they were taken.\n\n   But note: the entire assignment is fixed: we are going to assign exactly n digits to each. And the digit we assign now is the next one for that player.\n\n   So the recurrence:\n\n        dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the first i digits, having assigned h to Homer.\n\n        Then, if we assign the i-th digit (0-indexed) to Homer (if h < n):\n            The current digit is d_i (integer value). Its contribution to Homer's number is d_i * (10^(n - h - 1)).\n            But note: the rest of the digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) will also be assigned, and we know that there will be (n - h - 1) more digits for Homer. However, the assignment of the remaining digits doesn't affect the current digit's multiplier because the current digit's multiplier is determined by its position in the final number: it is the (h+1)-th digit, so 10^(n - h - 1). \n\n            However, wait: the above reasoning for the multiplier is correct for the final assignment. But the catch is: the rest of the digits we assign to Homer will be appended to the right, so the current digit's power is fixed by the fact that we have already assigned h digits and we are about to assign one more (so the current one becomes the (h+1)-th). \n\n            BUT: the problem is that the total number of digits for Homer is n, so the current digit is the (h+1)-th, and the remaining (n - h - 1) digits for Homer will be less significant. Therefore, the current digit's multiplier is 10^(n - h - 1).\n\n        Similarly, if we assign to Marge (if (i - h) < n, i.e., we haven't assigned n to Marge yet, because the total assigned so far is i, and we have h for Homer, so i-h for Marge) then the multiplier for the current digit in Marge's number is 10^(n - (i-h) - 1) ?\n\n        Actually, the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th digit for Marge (if we assign it now). And since Marge will have n digits in total, the current digit's power is 10^(n - (i-h)).\n\n        However, note: the entire number for Marge is built from the digits assigned to her, and the first digit she gets is the most significant. The first digit she gets is the one with the smallest index (earliest). The current digit is being considered at step i, and the previous digits assigned to Marge are i-h (because we have assigned h to Homer and i-h to Marge so far). So the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th for Marge, and the exponent is n - (i-h) - 1? \n\n        Let me reindex: \n          Marge's number has n digits. The first digit (the earliest) is multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n          The (k+1)-th digit (0-indexed k) is multiplied by 10^(n - k - 1). \n\n        Here, k is the count of digits assigned to Marge so far (excluding the current one). So if we assign the current one, then k becomes i-h (the current count for Marge) and then we assign one more, so the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th, and its multiplier is 10^(n - (i-h) - 1) ? \n\n        But wait, let's test with a small example.\n\n        Example: n=2, A=\"1234\", and we assign the first digit to Marge. Then i=0, h=0, so Marge count = i-h = 0. Then the multiplier for the first digit (if assigned to Marge) would be 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 10^1 = 10. Then the rest of Marge's digits (one more) will be the next digit we assign to her. Then the total for Marge would be 1*10 + (whatever the next digit is)*1.\n\n        Now, if we assign the first digit to Marge and then the second digit to Marge (so two in a row for Marge), then the two digits for Marge are '1' and '2'. Then Marge's number is 12, which is 1*10 + 2*1. Correct.\n\n        Now, if we assign the first digit to Marge and then the second digit to Homer, then Marge's number is 1 followed by nothing else? Actually, no: we are going to assign two digits to Marge. We must assign two digits to Marge. But in this case, we are at the first digit and we assign to Marge. Then at the second digit, we assign to Homer. Then at the third digit, we must assign to Marge (since we need two for Marge). Then the fourth digit goes to Homer.\n\n        But wait, the problem says each player makes exactly n moves. So we must assign n moves to each. So in the example, n=2, we must assign two to Marge and two to Homer.\n\n        However, the above example was only two moves. The entire sequence is four digits.\n\n        But the multiplier for the first digit (if assigned to Marge) is 10^(2-0-1)=10, and then the third digit (which is the next for Marge) will be the second digit for Marge, so multiplier 10^(2-1-1)=10^0=1.\n\n        So the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][h] = max {\n                (if h < n) { dp[i-1][h-1] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-h-1)) },\n                (if (i-h) < n) { dp[i-1][h] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h) - 1)) }\n            }\n\n        But wait, the above does not account for the entire number. Actually, the above adds the current digit's value to the total, but the other digits in the same player's number are built from the digits that are assigned to that player. However, note: the entire number for a player is built from the digits assigned to him. The above formula only accounts for the current digit. \n\n        However, the catch: the rest of the digits for the same player will be assigned later, but their multipliers are fixed when they are assigned. \n\n        But note: the above DP state does not remember the entire sequence, only the count for Homer. How do we account for the entire number? \n\n        Actually, the above recurrence does not work because the same digit's contribution depends on the order of assignment (i.e., the count of digits already assigned to the player). And we are using the current count (h for Homer) to compute the multiplier for the current digit. \n\n        However, the multiplier for a digit assigned to Homer at step i (if we assign now) is 10^(n - (h+1)) because the player will have h+1 digits in total (including this one) and the current digit is the (h+1)-th, so it is the (n - (h+1))-th power from the least significant? \n\n        Actually, the entire number has n digits. The first digit is the most significant (power n-1) and the last is 10^0.\n\n        The (h+1)-th digit (if we are counting from 0-indexed) is the (h+1)-th most significant. So its power is 10^(n - (h+1))? \n\n        Example: n=2, h=0: then the first digit is 10^(2-1) = 10^1, which is correct. Second digit for Homer: h=1, then 10^(2-2)=10^0, correct.\n\n        Similarly for Marge: the (m+1)-th digit (m = i-h) is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n        But wait: the state h is the count of digits assigned to Homer so far (including the current one if we assign now). Then the multiplier for the current digit (if assigned to Homer) is 10^(n - (h)) [if we are including the current one]? \n\n        Actually, if we are at state h (meaning we have assigned h digits to Homer so far) and we assign the current digit to Homer, then the new count becomes h+1. Then the current digit is the (h+1)-th digit for Homer, so its multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1)). \n\n        But note: in the recurrence above, we are using the state before the assignment. So if we are at state (i-1, h) and we assign the i-th digit to Homer, then the current digit's multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1)) (because after assignment, the count for Homer becomes h+1, and the current digit is the (h+1)-th).\n\n        However, we can also think: the entire number for Homer has n digits. The digits assigned so far (including the current one) are h+1. Then the current digit is the last one? No, we are building the number from left to right. The current digit is the next one. The remaining digits for Homer (to be assigned later) are n - (h+1). Therefore, the current digit's multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1))? \n\n        Actually, the entire number has n digits. The first digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), ... the (h+1)-th by 10^(n - (h+1))? \n\n        Example: n=2, h=0 (current state) and we assign the first digit to Homer: then the current digit's multiplier is 10^(2-1)=10, which is correct. Then if we assign the second digit to Homer, then the current digit's multiplier is 10^(2-2)=1, correct.\n\n        Now, what if we assign the first digit to Marge? Then we are at state (i=0, h=0) and we assign to Marge. Then the current digit's multiplier is 10^(n - (m+1)) where m is the current count for Marge. Initially, m=0 (because we haven't assigned any to Marge) and then we assign one, so m=1. Then multiplier is 10^(2-1)=10.\n\n        But wait, in the example above, if we assign the first digit to Marge, then the first digit (which is the most significant) should be 10^(n-1)=10, which is correct.\n\n        Now, if we assign the second digit to Marge (so we have two for Marge), then the second digit (at index1) is the second digit for Marge, so multiplier 10^(2-2)=1.\n\n        However, the state for Marge: we don't store m (count for Marge) separately, but we can compute m = i - h.\n\n        Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][h] = max( \n                (if h < n) dp[i-1][h-1] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - h - 1)),   # because after assignment, Homer has h digits, so current is the (h)-th? Wait, no: we are at state (i-1, h-1) and then we assign the i-th digit to Homer, so after assignment, Homer has h digits (which is h-1+1). Then the current digit is the h-th (if we count from 0-indexed, the first is h=0). So the multiplier is 10^(n - h - 1) ??? \n\n            Let me check: \n                After assignment, Homer has h digits (so the current assignment is the h-th digit for Homer, meaning the last one so far). Then the power is 10^(n - h - 1) ?\n\n            Example: n=2, h=1 (so the second digit for Homer) -> multiplier 10^(2-1-1)=10^0=1. Correct.\n\n            But wait, when we are at state (i-1, h-1): we have already assigned h-1 digits to Homer. Then we assign the current digit to Homer, making it h. Then the current digit is the h-th digit (0-indexed) for Homer, so its multiplier is 10^(n - h - 1) ?\n\n            However, the entire number has n digits. The first digit (h=0) is the most significant, so it should be 10^(n-1). The second (h=1) is 10^(n-2). \n\n            So the formula: the h-th digit (0-indexed) is multiplied by 10^(n - h - 1) is correct.\n\n        Similarly, for Marge: \n            The current state is (i-1, h). Then we assign the i-th digit to Marge. Then the count for Marge becomes (i-1 - h) + 1 = i - h (since i-1 digits have been processed, and h went to Homer, so Marge had (i-1 - h) digits). Then the current digit is the (i-h)-th digit for Marge (0-indexed). Then the multiplier is 10^(n - (i-h) - 1).\n\n        However, note: we are storing state by i (the number of digits processed) and h (the number of digits assigned to Homer). Then the count for Marge is i - h.\n\n        Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 0\n\n            For i from 0 to 2n-1:\n                for h from 0 to n:\n                    option1: assign to Homer (if h < n)\n                        dp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1))))\n\n                    option2: assign to Marge (if (i - h) < n)   [because Marge has so far i-h digits, and we need to assign n to Marge, so we require i-h < n]\n                        dp[i+1][h] = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h) - 1))\n\n        But wait, the exponent for Marge: the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th for Marge? Actually, no: the count for Marge after assignment is (i-h)+1 (because we are assigning the i-th digit, and the previous Marge count is i-h from the state (i-1, h) but wait: our state (i, h) means we have processed i digits and assigned h to Homer, so Marge has i-h. Then we assign the current digit (the i-th digit) to Marge, so Marge becomes i-h+1. Then the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th digit for Marge, so the multiplier is 10^(n - (i-h+1) - 1)? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          The entire Marge's number has n digits. The (k)-th digit (0-indexed) is multiplied by 10^(n - k - 1). \n          Now, the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th digit (if we count from 0, then the first digit is 0-indexed 0, the second is 1, etc.). So k = i-h (if we are going to assign this as the (i-h+1)-th, then the index is i-h). \n\n        Correction: the count for Marge so far (before the current digit) is i-h (from the state (i, h): we have processed i digits, so the current digit is the (i+1)-th digit. But wait, we are processing the i-th digit (0-indexed). \n\n        Actually, the state (i, h) means we have processed i digits (from 0 to i-1). Then we are processing the i-th digit (the next one). \n\n        Alternatively, let me redefine: let i be the number of digits processed (so we are at the i-th digit, and we have processed i digits). Then the state is (i, h). Then we process the i-th digit (the next one, the i-th digit in the string, 0-indexed i).\n\n        Then, if we assign the i-th digit to Homer, then the new state is (i+1, h+1). The current digit is the (h+1)-th digit for Homer (because we had h already, then we add one). Then the multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1) - 1)? \n\n        Wait, no: the entire number for Homer has n digits. The (h+1)-th digit (so the last digit so far) is the one that will be placed at the (n - (h+1))-th power from the most significant? \n\n        Actually, the entire number has n digits. The first digit (the one that appears first) is the most significant (power n-1). The second is power n-2, ... the (h+1)-th is power n - h - 1.\n\n        So the multiplier is 10^(n - h - 1).\n\n        Similarly, for Marge: the entire number has n digits. The current digit is the (i - h + 1)-th digit for Marge? \n\n        How many digits has Marge got so far? In state (i, h): we have processed i digits, and h have been assigned to Homer, so Marge has i-h digits. Then we assign the current digit (the i-th) to Marge, so Marge gets i-h+1 digits. Then the current digit is the (i-h+1)-th digit for Marge, so its multiplier is 10^(n - (i-h+1) - 1)? \n\n        Actually, the (k)-th digit (0-indexed) is multiplied by 10^(n - k - 1). The current digit is the (i-h)-th in Marge's sequence (if we count from 0) because we have already i-h digits and this is the next one. Then k = i-h, so multiplier is 10^(n - (i-h) - 1).\n\n        But wait: the entire number has n digits. The first digit (k=0) is 10^(n-1). The second (k=1) is 10^(n-2). The third (k=2) is 10^(n-3). So the k-th digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1-k). \n\n        Therefore, the current digit for Marge (the (i-h)-th digit, i.e., k = i-h) is multiplied by 10^(n-1 - (i-h)).\n\n        Similarly, for Homer: the current digit is the (h)-th digit (if we are at state (i, h) and we assign to Homer, then we are adding the (h+1)-th digit? Actually, the state (i, h) has h digits for Homer. Then the next one (if we assign now) is the (h+1)-th digit, so k = h, then multiplier is 10^(n-1 - h).\n\n        So the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the first i digits (0-indexed, i digits processed) and h digits assigned to Homer.\n\n            Then:\n\n            if h < n:\n                dp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)))\n\n            if (i - h) < n:   # because Marge has i-h digits so far (from the first i digits) and we can assign up to n\n                dp[i+1][h] = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-(i-h))))\n\n        However, note: the exponent for Marge is computed using the current count of Marge (i-h) which is the number of digits already assigned to Marge (before the current one). But the current digit is the next one for Marge, so it is the (i-h+1)-th digit. But the exponent is based on the position in the final number. The (i-h+1)-th digit is the (i-h)-th in 0-indexed (because we start counting from 0). So the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) is correct.\n\n        But wait: the entire Marge's number has n digits. The first digit (the earliest) is the most significant. The (i-h+1)-th digit is the (i-h)-th in 0-indexed, so the exponent is n-1 - (i-h). \n\n        Example: n=2, i=0, h=0 -> Marge count = 0, then the first digit (if assigned to Marge) is the 0-th digit for Marge, so exponent is 2-1-0 = 1, which is 10^1=10, correct.\n\n        Example: n=2, i=1, h=0 -> Marge count = 1, then the second digit (if assigned to Marge) is the 1st digit for Marge, so exponent is 2-1-1=0, which is 10^0=1, correct.\n\n        Now, the base case: \n            dp[0][0] = 0\n\n        Then we iterate for i from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n        But note: the state i goes from 0 to 2n, and h from 0 to n.\n\n        Then the answer is the maximum over h from 0 to n of dp[2n][h] (but we must have exactly n for each, so h must be n, and then Marge has 2n-n = n, which is valid). So we are interested in dp[2n][n].\n\n        However, the problem says: output any sequence of moves (string of 2n characters, n H's and n M's) that gives the maximum total prize.\n\n        We can reconstruct the path by storing the decisions.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            1. Read n and A (as string of digits)\n            2. Use DP table of size [2n+1][n+1] (each element is a float or integer, but the numbers can be very large, so we use integers)\n            3. Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, and the rest to -infinity or a very small number (but we are maximizing, so we can use -1 for impossible states, but we know we can only go from 0 to 2n and h from 0 to n).\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a DP array for the current and next state.\n\n            But note: n is at most 18, so 2n=36, and h from 0 to 18, so we can use a 2D array of size 37x19.\n\n            4. Then, we also need to record the choice (whether we assigned to Homer or Marge) and the digit index.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the first i digits (0-indexed, so i from 0 to 2n) with h digits assigned to Homer.\n\n                Then, we also keep a parent table: \n                    parent[i][h] = (prev_i, prev_h, choice) but we can just store the previous state and the choice.\n\n                Alternatively, we can store two arrays: \n                    choice[i][h] = either 'H' or 'M' (or None) that led to dp[i][h]\n\n                But note: we have two transitions.\n\n            5. Then, after computing dp[2n][n] (which is the maximum total prize), we backtrack to find a sequence.\n\n        However, note: the above recurrence does not account for the entire future. The multiplier for a digit is fixed by the current count, but the rest of the digits are assigned arbitrarily. But the DP is built by considering the entire assignment.\n\n        But wait: is the multiplier for a digit independent of the assignment of the remaining digits? \n\n        Actually, no: the assignment of the remaining digits affects the counts for the players, but the multiplier for a digit is determined solely by the count of the player at the moment of assignment (and the total n). \n\n        Why? Because the entire number for a player has fixed length (n). The digit's position in the final number is fixed by the order of assignment (the earlier the better). \n\n        Example: if we assign two digits to a player, then the first one is always the most significant (10^(n-1)) and the second is 10^(n-2)), regardless of what happens later.\n\n        Therefore, the above recurrence is correct.\n\n        But note: the exponents are very large (n up to 18, so 10^17 is a very big number). However, the problem says the number A has 2n digits, so we are dealing with numbers up to 10^(2n)-1, which is acceptable in Python with integers.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Let dp = [[-1]*(n+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number A. The goal is to assign exactly n digits to each player such that the sum of their respective numbers (formed by the digits they select) is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves selecting digits from the left end of a 2n-digit number A, assigning each digit to either Homer or Marge, with each player selecting exactly n digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of selections (a string of 'H' and 'M' characters) that maximizes the sum of the two numbers formed by the selected digits.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The value of a digit in a player's number depends on its position (most significant digit contributes more). The first digit selected by a player will always be the most significant (highest power of 10), the next will be the next most significant, and so on.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][h]` where `i` is the number of digits processed so far, and `h` is the number of digits assigned to Homer. The value `dp[i][h]` represents the maximum total prize achievable after processing `i` digits with `h` digits assigned to Homer.\n\n4. **Transitions**:\n   - **Assign to Homer**: If Homer has fewer than `n` digits, the current digit's value is added to Homer's number with a multiplier based on its position (10^(n - h - 1)).\n   - **Assign to Marge**: If Marge has fewer than `n` digits, the current digit's value is added to Marge's number with a multiplier based on its position (10^(n - (i - h) - 1)).\n\n5. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[2n][n]` to construct the sequence of moves ('H' or 'M') that achieves the maximum prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    dp = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    parent = [[''] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    \n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for h in range(n + 1):\n            if dp[i][h] == -1:\n                continue\n            digit_val = int(A[i])\n            if h < n:\n                new_h = h + 1\n                exponent = n - new_h\n                new_value = dp[i][h] + digit_val * (10 ** exponent)\n                if new_value > dp[i + 1][new_h]:\n                    dp[i + 1][new_h] = new_value\n                    parent[i + 1][new_h] = 'H'\n            if (i - h) < n:\n                new_h = h\n                m_count = i - h\n                exponent = n - m_count - 1\n                new_value = dp[i][h] + digit_val * (10 ** exponent)\n                if new_value > dp[i + 1][new_h]:\n                    dp[i + 1][new_h] = new_value\n                    parent[i + 1][new_h] = 'M'\n    \n    seq = []\n    i, h = total_digits, n\n    while i > 0:\n        move = parent[i][h]\n        seq.append(move)\n        if move == 'H':\n            i -= 1\n            h -= 1\n        else:\n            i -= 1\n            h = h\n    \n    seq.reverse()\n    print(''.join(seq))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of 2n digits. The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum prize achievable after processing each digit, and `parent` keeps track of the last move made (either 'H' or 'M').\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: For each digit in `A`, the algorithm checks all possible states (number of digits assigned to Homer so far). It updates the DP table by considering both assignments (to Homer or Marge) and calculates the new prize value based on the digit's position in the respective player's number.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: After processing all digits, the algorithm backtracks from the state `dp[2n][n]` (all digits processed, exactly n digits to each player) to reconstruct the sequence of moves. The sequence is built by following the parent pointers from the end to the start.\n\n4. **Output**: The reconstructed sequence of moves ('H' for Homer and 'M' for Marge) is printed, ensuring both players have exactly n digits and the total prize is maximized. \n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible digit assignments using dynamic programming and backtracking to find the optimal solution.",
