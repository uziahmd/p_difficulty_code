    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n We are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. But note: it doesn't increase by one every time. \n For example, when n goes from 24 to 25, f(24)=4, f(25)=6. So there might be gaps.\n\n Observation:\n 1. There will be a range of consecutive n's that have the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: \n    f(n) stays constant for a while and then jumps at multiples of 5. But note: after a jump, the next value is higher and then remains until the next multiple of 5 (or higher power).\n\n However, the problem says: find all n such that the factorial ends with exactly m zeroes.\n\n We cannot iterate n from 1 upwards because m can be up to 100000 and n can be very large (because the number of zeros increases logarithmically).\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then we can look for the exact m.\n\n But note: the problem asks for all n such that f(n)=m.\n\n Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of n satisfying f(n)=m must form a contiguous interval? \n\n Actually, consider: \n   f(n) = m, then for n+1, if n+1 is not divisible by 5, then f(n+1)=f(n). \n   But when n+1 is divisible by 5, then we add one or more zeros.\n\n So the numbers n for which f(n)=m form an interval [L, R] (if any exists) such that:\n   L = smallest n with f(n)=m\n   R = largest n with f(n)=m\n\n How to find L and R?\n\n We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but we want the first n such that f(n)==m.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Let L be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but then we must check if f(L) == m.\n\n However, note that f(n) is computed by the formula. We can also compute the lower bound for n to get m zeros.\n\n Actually, we can use the standard method to compute the minimal n for m zeros:\n\n   n_min = 0\n   while f(n_min) < m:\n        n_min += 1\n\n But m can be up to 100000, and n_min can be very large (like around 4*m, but actually more because of powers). \n This loop would be too slow.\n\n Instead, we can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n But then we need to know the exact n where f(n) becomes m. Actually, we can do:\n\n   low = 0, high = 5*m (a safe upper bound? because the number of zeros is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... <= n/4, so n_min is at most about 5*m)\n\n However, let's define:\n\n   Let g(m) be the minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n   Then we know that f(g(m)-1) < m <= f(g(m)).\n\n   Now, we want to know if there is an n such that f(n)=m. Note that the minimal n for m zeros is g(m). \n   But it is possible that f(g(m)) > m. Then we might have skipped m.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let this be L0.\n   Then, we need to check if f(L0) == m. If yes, then the smallest n is L0.\n\n   But what if f(L0) > m? Then we must find the smallest n such that f(n) == m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can find two values:\n\n   Let L = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Let R = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n in [L, R-1] will have f(n) = m? \n\n   Why? Because f(n) is non-decreasing, and at n=R, we have f(R) >= m+1, and at n=L, we have f(L) >= m, and for n in [L, R-1] we have m <= f(n) < m+1.\n\n   But note: f(n) is increasing only by steps. It jumps by the multiplicity of 5s. So if we have a jump from m to m+k (k>=1) at some point, then the numbers with f(n)=m are from L to the n just before the jump that would cause the next m+1.\n\n   Actually, the set of n with f(n)=m is [L, R-1] if f(L) == m and f(R-1) == m and f(R) >= m+1.\n\n   However, note: it is possible that between L and R there are jumps that skip m? No, because we defined R as the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Then the condition for having exactly m is that n is in [L, R-1].\n\n   But wait: what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then our binary search for m+1 might return a value that is less than the current L? Actually, we must ensure that m is achievable.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. And we know that for sufficiently large n, the trailing zeros become arbitrarily large, so m is always achievable? \n\n   Actually, no. Consider: m=1. We know that n=5 gives 1 zero. But what if m is 0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   But note: the example input ['1', '5'] outputs ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\n   Wait, the example input is two separate examples? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Input: The only line of input contains an integer m.\n\n   Then output: First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: 1 -> Output: 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9\n        Input: 5 -> Output: 0 (meaning no n such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros)\n\n   Why? Let's check:\n\n        n=5: 1 zero\n        n=6: 1 zero\n        n=7: 1 zero\n        n=8: 1 zero\n        n=9: 1 zero\n        n=10: 2 zeros\n\n        Then, does 5! to 9! have exactly 1 trailing zero? Yes, so m=1 -> 5 numbers.\n\n        Now, m=5: \n            We need to find n such that f(n)=5.\n\n        We know:\n          n=20: \n            f(20) = 20//5 + 20//25 = 4+0 = 4\n          n=21: 4\n          n=22: 4\n          n=23: 4\n          n=24: 4\n          n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5+1+0 = 6\n\n        So from 20 to 24: 4 zeros, then at 25 it jumps to 6. Therefore, there is no n with 5 zeros.\n\n        So the answer for m=5 is 0.\n\n   Therefore, we must account for gaps.\n\n   Revised plan:\n\n   We want to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (call this L).\n   Then we want to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call this R).\n\n   Then, the numbers n with f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1, provided that f(L) == m and f(R-1)==m.\n\n   But note: if f(L) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m? Actually, by definition, L is the smallest n with f(n)>=m, so if f(L) != m, then f(L) must be > m (since it's non-decreasing and integer valued). Then the set is empty.\n\n   However, wait: what if m is 0? But m>=1. \n\n   But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   However, the gaps might occur. So we can say:\n\n      Let L = minimal n with f(n) >= m.\n      Let R = minimal n with f(n) >= m+1.\n\n      Then, if f(L) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m (because f(L) is already greater than m, and we skipped m).\n\n      But wait, how can we skip m? Because the function f(n) increases by more than one sometimes (like from 4 to 6 at n=25). So if m is 5, then L (minimal n with f(n)>=5) is 25, and f(25)=6, so indeed skipped.\n\n   Therefore, the condition for having at least one n with f(n)=m is that the minimal n with f(n)>=m must have f(n)==m.\n\n   Then, the set of n is [L, R-1] (all integers from L to R-1) because:\n\n        For any n in [L, R-1]: \n            f(n) >= m (by definition of L) and f(n) < m+1 (because R is the first n that reaches m+1, so for n < R, f(n) < m+1).\n\n        And since f is non-decreasing, the values in [L, R-1] must be exactly m.\n\n   But wait, what if the minimal n for m+1 is actually less than L? That cannot happen because we defined R as the minimal n for m+1, and we know that m+1>m, so R should be >= L.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Write a helper function f(n) that computes the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   2. Use binary search to find L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n   3. Use binary search to find R = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   4. Check if f(L) == m. If not, then there are 0 numbers.\n\n   5. Otherwise, the numbers are from L to R-1, inclusive. The count is (R - L).\n\n   However, note: the problem requires to output first the count, then the list of numbers (if any) in increasing order.\n\n   But note: the list of numbers from L to R-1 can be very long if the gap between L and R is large. However, the gap is at most 4 (because the trailing zeros only jump by the exponent of 5, and the maximum jump is when n is a multiple of a high power of 5, but the gap between two consecutive jumps is at most 4, and the entire set of n with the same trailing zeros is at most 5 consecutive numbers? Actually, no: the gap can be longer? \n\n   Let me check: \n        n! gets a jump at every multiple of 5. But the jump size is the exponent of 5 in n. \n\n        Example: n=24 -> 4 zeros, n=25 -> 6 zeros, so gap from 5 to 24? Actually, the zeros are 4 for n=20 to 24, then 6 for n=25. So the set for m=4 would be [20,24] (5 numbers). \n\n        Now, consider m=6: \n            n=25: 6 zeros, then n=26: 6 zeros (until 29), then n=30: 7 zeros (because 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1=7). \n            So set for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers).\n\n        But wait, what about m=2? \n            n=10: 2 zeros, n=11:2, n=12:2, n=13:2, n=14:2, n=15: 15//5+15//25=3+0=3 -> so set for m=2 is [10,14] (5 numbers).\n\n        Pattern: the set for a given m (if exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n        Actually, no. Consider m=3: \n            n=15: 3 zeros, n=16:3, n=17:3, n=18:3, n=19:3, n=20:4 -> so [15,19] (5 numbers).\n\n        But wait, what about m=0? (though m>=1) \n            n=0:0, n=1:0, n=2:0, n=3:0, n=4:0, n=5:1 -> [0,4] (5 numbers).\n\n        However, the problem says positive integers n, so n>=1. But m>=1, so we don't care about 0.\n\n        But wait, what about m=4? We saw [20,24] (5 numbers). \n\n        So it seems that if m is present, then there are exactly 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n        Why 5? Because the trailing zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5, which is 5 numbers away? \n\n        Actually, the trailing zeros increase when n is a multiple of 5. And the number of trailing zeros increases by the exponent of 5 in n (which is at least 1). \n\n        However, note: the set of n for which f(n)=m is the set of n from the first n that gives m zeros to the n just before the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase (and the increase might be more than one, so the set might be shorter). \n\n        But wait, the set is defined by two consecutive multiples of 5? Not necessarily. The next jump happens at the next n that is a multiple of 5, but the jump might be more than one. \n\n        Actually, the set is from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, unless the next jump is more than one and then we break earlier? \n\n        However, note: the function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5. And at a multiple of 5, it increases. The amount of increase is the exponent of 5 in n. \n\n        Example: n=25: exponent of 5 is 2 (since 25=5^2), so it adds 2 zeros. \n\n        Therefore, if we are at m and then we hit a multiple of 5 that adds k zeros (k>=1), then the set for m is [L, L0] where L0 is the next multiple of 5 minus one, but only if the next jump doesn't overshoot m? \n\n        Actually, no: the set for m is from the first n that achieves m zeros until the n just before the next jump that would take us to at least m+1.\n\n        But note: the next jump (at the next multiple of 5) adds k zeros, so the zeros become m + k. Therefore, the set for m is [L, R-1] where R is the next multiple of 5 that causes the zeros to become at least m+1. However, if k>m, then m is skipped.\n\n        But wait, our binary search for R (minimal n for m+1) already accounts for that. \n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n        We can compute:\n            L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m\n            R = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, if f(L) != m, then output 0.\n\n        Else, output the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints: m up to 100000.\n\n        We must compute f(n) for n that can be up to 5*m (which is 500000). But note: the minimal n for m zeros is approximately 5*m (actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the solution to the equation f(n)=m, which is roughly 5*m, but sometimes a bit more). \n\n        But wait, the minimal n for m zeros is the smallest n such that the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k) >= m.\n\n        We can use binary search for n in the range [0, 5*m] (or maybe 5*m is not enough, but note that the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m + something? Actually, we can set high = 5*m (but sometimes we need more because of the higher powers). \n\n        Alternatively, we can set high = 5*m * 5? But to be safe, we can set high = 5*m * 5, or even 5*m + 100 (but we don't know). \n\n        However, note: the minimal n for m zeros is the smallest n such that the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k) >= m.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m * 5   # a safe bound: because the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m + 4 (but actually, the minimal n is known to be about 5*m, but sometimes more, but not by much? Actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the solution to the equation: n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... >= m, which is less than n/4. So n_min <= 4*m. But wait, no: the series is geometric. \n\n        Actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the minimal n such that n/5 + n/25 + ... >= m, and the sum is bounded by n/4 (since 1/5+1/25+...=1/4). So n_min >= 4*m. But we are doing integer floors, so we can set high = 5*m (which is a multiple of 5) and then adjust.\n\n        However, to be safe, we can set:\n\n            high = 5*m * 5   # because the minimal n for m zeros might be as large as 5*m (if m is large) but actually, the minimal n for m zeros is less than 5*m (because at n=5*m, the zeros are at least m). \n\n        But wait, at n=5*m, the zeros are: floor(5*m/5) + floor(5*m/25) + ... = m + floor(4*m/5) + ... which is >= m. So we can set high = 5*m.\n\n        However, we are doing two binary searches: one for m and one for m+1. We need to compute f(n) for n up to 5*(m+1) (so about 500000). This is acceptable because we do two binary searches (each about 20 iterations) and each iteration computes f(n) in O(log_5(n)) steps (which is about 7 for n=500000).\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Function f(n): \n            count = 0\n            base = 5\n            while base <= n:\n                count += n // base\n                base *= 5\n\n        Then, define:\n\n            def find_minimal_n(target):\n                lo = 0\n                hi = 5 * target * 5   # safe bound: 25*target. But target can be up to 100001, so hi=250002500, which is too big? \n                # Alternatively, we can set hi to something smaller. We know that n_min is at most 5*target (because at n=5*target, the zeros are at least target). \n                # But wait, at n=5*target, the zeros are: \n                #   floor(5*target/5) + floor(5*target/25) + ... = target + floor(4*target/5) + ... >= target.\n                # So we can set hi = 5*target.\n\n                # However, we want to be efficient. Let's set hi = 5*target (if target>0) or 0 if target==0.\n\n                if target == 0:\n                    return 0\n\n                lo = 0\n                hi = 5 * target   # because we know that n=5*target gives at least target zeros.\n\n                while lo < hi:\n                    mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                    if f(mid) < target:\n                        lo = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        hi = mid\n\n                return lo\n\n        Then:\n\n            m_val = int(input().strip())\n            if m_val == 0:\n                # According to the problem, m>=1, so this might not be needed.\n                # But let's assume m>=1.\n                pass\n\n            L = find_minimal_n(m_val)\n            R = find_minimal_n(m_val+1)   # if m_val is the last, then R is the minimal n for m_val+1.\n\n            # Now, check if f(L) == m_val\n            if f(L) != m_val:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                count = R - L\n                # Then the numbers are from L to R-1 (inclusive)\n                # But note: R is the minimal n with f(n)>=m_val+1, so the numbers with exactly m_val are from L to R-1.\n\n                # However, the problem requires to output the numbers in increasing order, but if the count is large (like 5) then we output the entire list? \n                # But wait, the example m=1: output is 5, then the numbers 5 to 9.\n\n                # But if m_val is 5, then we output 0.\n\n                # However, the problem says: \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

The length of the interval is (R - L). \n                #   But note: the function f(n) increases by the exponent of 5 at n. The exponent can be 1,2,3,... so the jump at R is by at least 1. Therefore, the set [L, R-1] has exactly (jump_size) numbers? \n\n                # Actually, the set is contiguous and the length is (R - L). \n\n                # But note: the example m=1: \n                #   L = 5, R = 10 (because f(10)=2, so R is the minimal n for m=2, which is 10). Then the set is [5,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # Example m=2:\n                #   L = 10, R = 15 (because f(15)=3, so R=15).

Actually, no: we skip m if the jump is more than one.\n\n                # But note: the set for m is 5 consecutive numbers if the next jump (at n=5*k) does not skip m. However, if the jump is more than one, then m is skipped.\n\n                # Therefore, the set [L, R-1] has (R-L) numbers. But note: R is the minimal n such that f(n)>=m+1, and the set for m is [L, R-1] only if f(L)==m. \n\n                # However, the length (R-L) is fixed to 5? \n\n                # Actually, no: the length is determined by the next jump. The zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5. The next multiple of 5 is at n = L + (5 - (L % 5)) if L%5 !=0, but if L is a multiple of 5 then the next multiple is L+5. \n\n                # But note: the set for m is from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, unless the next multiple of 5 causes a jump that exceeds m (then the set is broken earlier). \n\n                # However, our method using R (the minimal n for m+1) already accounts for the jump. \n\n                # But wait, why is the set for m=1 5 numbers? Because the next jump (at 10) is by 1 (from 1 to 2). Similarly, for m=2, the next jump at 15 is by 1 (from 2 to 3). \n\n                # But for m=4, the next jump at 25 is by 2 (from 4 to 6), so m=5 is skipped.\n\n                # Therefore, the set for m has 5 numbers if the next jump is 1. But if the next jump is more than 1, then we break the set earlier? Actually, no: the set is broken at the next jump, but the set for m is still the same as long as the jump is at least 1? \n\n                # Actually, the set is [L, R-1] and the length is R-L. \n\n                # In the case of m=1: \n                #   L=5, R=10 -> length=5\n                #   m=2: L=10, R=15 -> length=5\n                #   m=3: L=15, R=20 -> length=5\n                #   m=4: L=20, R=25 -> length=5\n                #   m=5: skipped, so no set.\n\n                # But wait, what about m=0?

Because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, and between two consecutive multiples of 5 there are 5 numbers. The jump at a multiple of 5 adds at least 1, so the zeros remain the same for the previous 4 numbers (if the jump is 1) and then the next jump (if any) would be at the next multiple of 5, which is 5 numbers later.\n\n                # Therefore, the set for m is either 5 consecutive numbers or empty (if skipped). \n\n                # But wait, what if the jump is 2? Then we skip one m. For example, m=5 is skipped because the jump from 24 to 25 is from 4 to 6 (skipping 5). Similarly, if we have a jump of 3, we skip two m's.\n\n                # However, our method using binary search for R (minimal n for m+1) is correct.\n\n                # But note: the problem does not require to output the entire list if the set is large? Actually, the set is at most 5 numbers (if present). \n\n                # Why at most 5? Because the next jump occurs at the next multiple of 5, and the set is from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one (if the jump is 1). But if the jump is more than one, then the set is still from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, but then the next jump (if any) is accounted for by R being set to the next jump that reaches m+1 (which might be the same jump that gives more than one). \n\n                # Actually, the set [L, R-1] is defined by the next jump that causes the zeros to become at least m+1. The next jump (if it is at n=L+delta) might be the same jump that adds k zeros (k>=1). Then the set is [L, L+k-1]? \n\n                # Let me test with m=4: \n                #   L=20, then the next jump is at 25 (which is 5 away) and adds 2 zeros. Then the set is [20,24] (5 numbers). \n                #   But wait, 20,21,22,23,24: that's 5 numbers.\n\n                # The jump at 25 adds 2 zeros, so from 20 to 24 we have 5 numbers.\n\n                # Now, consider a jump of 3: \n                #   Suppose we have a number n0 that is a multiple of 125 (5^3). Then the jump at n0 adds 3 zeros.\n                #   Example: n0=125: \n                #       f(124) = 124//5 + 124//25 + 124//125 = 24+4+0=28\n                #       f(125) = 125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 = 25+5+1=31\n                #       So from 124 we get 28, then at 125 we get 31. \n                #       Then, the set for m=29 and m=30 and m=31? \n                #       Actually, we are looking for m=29,30: \n                #           Minimal n for 29: \n                #               We know f(124)=28, so we need to go higher. \n                #           Let's compute f(125)=31, so the minimal n for 29 must be between 125 and ...? Actually, the zeros increase by 3 at 125, so we skip 29 and 30.\n\n                #       Then, the set for m=29: \n                #           L = minimal n with f(n)>=29 -> n=125, but f(125)=31 !=29 -> so output 0.\n                #       Similarly for m=30: output 0.\n\n                # Therefore, the set for m is either 5 numbers or 0, but never 1,2,3, or 4 numbers? \n\n                # Actually, from the examples, the set is always 5 numbers if present, or 0.\n\n                # Why 5?

Because the trailing zeros are increased by multiples of 5. So the minimal n that achieves m zeros must be a multiple of 5.\n\n                # Therefore, the set of n with f(n)=m is [L, L+4] (if L is the minimal n and the jump at L is 1, then we have 5 numbers). \n\n                # However, if the jump at L is more than 1, then we skip m and the set is empty.\n\n                # But wait, how do we know the jump at L? \n\n                # The jump at L is the exponent of 5 in L. \n\n                # We can compute the jump at L by: \n                #   jump = 0\n                #   temp = L\n                #   while temp % 5 == 0:\n                #       jump += 1\n                #       temp //= 5\n\n                # Then, if jump > 1, then the zeros at L are increased by jump, so the zeros at L-1 must have been m - jump (if m-jump is nonnegative) and then we skip m. \n\n                # But note: we defined L as the minimal n such that f(n)>=m. \n\n                # Actually, we can use:\n\n                #   Let L0 = L, then the zeros at L0 is f(L0).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimal \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( m \\), we use binary search to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( f(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( f(R) \\geq m+1 \\). The numbers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( f(n) = m \\) lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( f(L) = m \\). If \\( f(L) \\neq m \\), it means no such \\( n \\) exists because the function \\( f(n) \\) jumps over \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Output the Result**: If \\( f(L) = m \\), the valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\), inclusive. The count of these numbers is \\( R - L \\). The result is then printed as the count followed by the list of these numbers in increasing order. If no such \\( n \\) exists, only the count (0) is printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef f(n):\n    count = 0\n    base = 5\n    while base <= n:\n        count += n // base\n        base *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_minimal_n(target):\n    if target == 0:\n        return 0\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * target\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if f(mid) < target:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    m_val = int(input().strip())\n    L = find_minimal_n(m_val)\n    if f(L) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        R = find_minimal_n(m_val + 1)\n        count = R - L\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n            print(' '.join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `f(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Function `find_minimal_n(target)`**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times \\text{target} \\), ensuring efficiency.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the minimal \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) where \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( f(L) \\) equals \\( m \\), it then finds the minimal \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) where \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid numbers are those from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\). The count and list of these numbers are printed. If no such numbers exist, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
