    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph.\n   and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with n nodes.\n\n Conditions for p-reachable:\n   The graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and there is a path from u to v and from v to u.\n\n Note: In a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k, the condition (u < v and mutual reachability) is satisfied for every pair (u, v) with u < v in that SCC. However, note that the problem says \"exactly p\", so we are counting unordered pairs (with u < v) that are mutually reachable. But note: the problem states \"ordered pair (u,v)\" but then specifies u < v. So we are counting unordered pairs (but ordered by node labels) that form a strongly connected component? Actually, the condition is that the entire graph has exactly p pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n However, note: the graph may have multiple strongly connected components (SCCs). But the condition is about mutual reachability. In fact, the set of nodes that form a strongly connected component (SCC) will have all pairs (u, v) (with u < v) being mutually reachable. And if two nodes are in different SCCs, then they are not mutually reachable (unless the graph is strongly connected, but then we have one big SCC).\n\n But note: the definition of p-reachable is that the graph contains exactly p such pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that are mutually reachable. This p is the total number of mutually reachable unordered pairs (with u < v) in the entire graph.\n\n How do we break down?\n   Let the graph have several SCCs. Then the mutually reachable pairs are only within each SCC. For an SCC of size k, the number of mutually reachable pairs (with u < v) is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n However, note: the entire graph must be such that the set of mutually reachable pairs (within SCCs) is exactly p.\n\n Also, note: the graph must be built with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Suppose we have a graph with n nodes. Then we can partition the n nodes into several SCCs. But note: the graph is directed and we are allowed to choose any structure.\n\n However, to minimize the number of nodes, we want to maximize the use of the SCCs: because having a larger SCC gives more pairs (C(k,2)) per node, but we are constrained by the total p.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the minimum n such that there exists a way to partition n into positive integers (the sizes of SCCs) so that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components is exactly p.\n\n    But note: the graph must be p-reachable, meaning the total number of pairs (u < v) with mutual reachability is p. Therefore, the entire graph must have p such pairs. \n\n    However, we are allowed to have multiple SCCs. The condition for p-reachable is that the graph has exactly p pairs (u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n    Also, note: the graph must not have any extra mutual reachability. So if we break the graph into SCCs, then the pairs that are mutually reachable are exactly the pairs within each SCC.\n\n    Therefore, we require: \n        p = sum_{each SCC i} [ C(k_i, 2) ]\n\n    But note: we are allowed to choose the graph arbitrarily as long as the condition holds. We can have isolated nodes (which form an SCC of size 1, contributing 0) and also chains or cycles.\n\n    However, the problem does not specify that the graph must be strongly connected, just that it has exactly p pairs (with u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n    We want the minimum n (the total number of nodes) such that we can represent p as the sum of triangular numbers (i.e., T_k = k*(k-1)//2) for some positive integers (the sizes of the SCCs) and the sum of these k_i is n.\n\n    But note: we can use multiple SCCs. However, we are not forced to use all the nodes in one SCC. We can split the graph arbitrarily.\n\n    So the problem reduces to: Represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (allowing repetition) and minimize the total number of nodes (which is the sum of the k_i's). But note: we can use any number of SCCs.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the graph must be built with n nodes and the entire graph must have no more than n nodes.\n\n    But note: the triangular numbers are fixed. We need to represent p as a sum of some triangular numbers (each being T_k = k*(k-1)//2) and minimize the total nodes (which is the sum of the k's).\n\n    Example: p=3.\n\n        We can use one SCC of size 3: T_3 = 3, then total nodes = 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we could use three SCCs of size 2: T_2 = 1, then three of them would give 3, and total nodes = 6 -> which is worse.\n\n        Or one SCC of size 3 and the rest isolated? Actually, we don't need to use all nodes in one SCC. But we are minimizing the total nodes.\n\n        So we want to minimize n = sum_i (k_i) subject to sum_i (T_{k_i}) >= p? Actually, we need exactly p.\n\n        However, note: the condition is exactly p. But we can also use multiple SCCs and the triangular numbers must add up to exactly p.\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to have multiple SCCs. The graph is p-reachable if the total number of mutually reachable pairs is p. So we must have the sum of the triangular numbers of the SCCs equal to p.\n\n        Now, we are free to choose the SCCs (any sizes) as long as their triangular numbers sum to p, and we want to minimize the total nodes (the sum of the sizes).\n\n        Observation: Using an SCC of size k gives T_k = k*(k-1)//2 pairs, and uses k nodes.\n\n        How to minimize the total nodes? We should use as large SCCs as possible because T_k grows quadratically and the node count linearly, so we get more pairs per node.\n\n        Actually, we want to maximize the ratio (pairs per node) = (k*(k-1)//2) / k = (k-1)/2. So the larger the k, the more pairs per node.\n\n        Therefore, to minimize the total nodes, we should use as few SCCs as possible and with the largest possible k.\n\n        But note: we must form the sum p exactly.\n\n        Let's consider: we can break p into a sum of triangular numbers (each being T_k for k>=1). Then the total nodes is the sum of the k's.\n\n        However, note: the triangular numbers are: T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3, T_4=6, T_5=10, etc.\n\n        We are to find the minimum total nodes (n) such that we can write p as a sum of triangular numbers (with repetition allowed) and n is the sum of the corresponding k's.\n\n        Example: p=0 -> n=0? But note: the graph must have nodes. Actually, the problem says \"minimum number of nodes\". For p=0, we can have 0 nodes? But the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v)\" and u != v. With 0 nodes, there are no pairs. So n=0 is acceptable.\n\n        Example: p=1 -> we can use one SCC of size 2 (T_2=1) and then n=2.\n\n        Example: p=2 -> cannot use two T_2 (since 1+1=2) and n=4 (two SCCs of size 2). Alternatively, we can use one SCC of size 3 (T_3=3) which is too big. So we use two SCCs of size 2: n=4.\n\n        Example: p=3 -> one SCC of size 3: T_3=3, so n=3.\n\n        Example: p=4 -> we can use one SCC of size 3 (T_3=3) and one SCC of size 2 (T_2=1) -> total pairs 4, and n=3+2=5.\n\n        But wait, is there a better way? Alternatively, four SCCs of size 2: 4*1=4, then n=8. So 5 is better.\n\n        Example: p=5 -> we can use one SCC of size 3 (3) and two SCCs of size 2 (1+1=2) -> total 5, and n=3+2+2=7.\n\n        Alternatively, one SCC of size 4: T_4=6 -> too big. So 7 is the minimum.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use more than one SCC, and we can mix. But we cannot use fractional SCCs.\n\n        So the problem becomes: Represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each at least 0, but note: T_1=0, so we can use as many 0's as we want, but that doesn't help because we want to minimize the total nodes) and minimize the sum of the corresponding k's.\n\n        Since T_k = k*(k-1)//2, then the k for a triangular number t is the solution to k(k-1)/2 = t -> k ~ sqrt(2*t). But we are allowed to use multiple k's.\n\n        How to solve this?\n\n        Notice: the minimal representation is to use as many large triangular numbers as possible.\n\n        However, we are constrained by the fact that we must use exactly p.\n\n        We can use dynamic programming? But p can be up to 200000.\n\n        Alternatively, note that the triangular numbers are non-negative and increasing. We can try to use the greedy algorithm: use the largest triangular number that is <= p, subtract, and then continue.\n\n        But is the greedy algorithm optimal for minimizing the total nodes?\n\n        Consider: We want to minimize the total nodes (the sum of the k_i) given that the sum of the triangular numbers is p.\n\n        Since T_k is convex and the ratio (pairs per node) is (k-1)/2 (increasing with k), we want to use as many large k as possible.\n\n        However, sometimes breaking a large triangular number into smaller ones might yield fewer total nodes? \n\n        Example: Let p=10. \n          Option1: use one SCC of size 5: T_5=10, then n=5.\n          Option2: use two SCCs: one of size 4 (T_4=6) and one of size 3 (T_3=3): total 9, not enough. Then we need to break 10-9=1, so we use one SCC of size 2 for the remaining 1: then n=4+3+2=9 -> worse.\n\n        Actually, we are constrained by the exact sum.\n\n        Another example: p=11.\n          Option1: one SCC of size 5 (10) and one SCC of size 2 (1): total nodes=5+2=7.\n          Option2: one SCC of size 4 (6) and one SCC of size 3 (3) and one SCC of size 2 (1): 6+3+1=10, total nodes=4+3+2=9 -> worse.\n\n        But what about p=2? \n          Triangular numbers: T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3 (too big). So we use two T_2: 1+1=2, then n=2+2=4.\n\n        However, note: we can use an SCC of size 3 and then subtract 3, then we have -1 which is not allowed. So we must use two T_2.\n\n        But wait, is there a representation for p=2 without using two T_2? No, because we cannot use negative or zero (except zeros don't help). So we must use two T_2.\n\n        Now, the key: we are allowed to use SCCs of any size (so any triangular number) and we can use as many as we want.\n\n        We need to compute the minimum total nodes (n) such that there exists a set of k_i (each >=1) with sum_i T_{k_i} = p and n = sum_i k_i.\n\n        This is similar to the coin change problem where coins are the triangular numbers (for k>=2, since T_1=0 doesn't help) and we want to minimize the total value of the coins (which is the sum of k_i) for the given amount p.\n\n        However, note: we are not limited by the number of coins (SCCs) and we can use any triangular number (from T_2, T_3, ...) repeatedly.\n\n        But note: the triangular numbers are not bounded, but p is up to 200000. The maximum k we might need: \n            T_k = k*(k-1)//2 <= p (max 200000) -> k*(k-1) <= 400000 -> k ~ sqrt(400000) ~ 632.\n\n        So we have about 632 distinct triangular numbers (from k=2 to k=632). Then we have to solve a coin change problem with up to 200000 and 632 coins. But note: 632 coins is too many for a typical DP (state space 200001 * 632 is about 126e6 states, which might be borderline in C++ but in Python we need to be careful). However, note that the triangular numbers are increasing and we are allowed to use unlimited supply.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy method? But the coin change problem for minimization of the total value (here the coin value is k_i, but the amount we are representing is the triangular number T_k) is not the standard one.\n\n        Let me reframe: We have coins of denominations d_i = k_i (but actually the denomination is the value T_k, and the cost of using a coin is k_i). We wish to represent the amount p (as the sum of the T_k's) and minimize the total cost (sum of k_i).\n\n        This is a linear programming type problem, but we can use the following:\n\n        Let f(p) = minimum total nodes (i.e., sum of k_i) to achieve exactly p.\n\n        Then we have:\n          f(0) = 0\n          For p>0, f(p) = min_{for each triangular number t_i <= p} { f(p - t_i) + k_i }\n\n        But note: the triangular numbers are defined for k>=2: \n            t_2 = 1, k=2\n            t_3 = 3, k=3\n            t_4 = 6, k=4\n            ...\n\n        However, the state space is 0 to 200000, and there are about 632 triangular numbers (for k from 2 to about 632). So we would have to iterate for each state and for each triangular number, which is O(p * number_of_triangular_numbers) ~ 200000 * 632 ~ 126400000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be slow.\n\n        But note: the constraints say p up to 200000, and we have about 632 triangular numbers, so 200000*632 is 126400000, which is acceptable in PyPy or in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize with a list and precomputation.\n\n        However, the problem says p can be 0 to 200000, and we are only required to compute for one p. So we can run a DP for the given p.\n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n          Let dp[i] = minimum total nodes (i.e., sum of k_i) to achieve exactly i (the total triangular number sum).\n\n          We initialize dp[0] = 0, and dp[i] = infinity for i>0.\n\n          For each triangular number t (which corresponds to a k) from k=2 to k_max (until t<=p), we do:\n\n            for j from t to p:\n                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n          Then answer n = dp[p]\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use multiple SCCs, and we can use the same triangular number multiple times.\n\n        But wait: the above DP is the standard unbounded knapsack (each triangular number can be used multiple times). \n\n        But the problem: the triangular numbers are distinct for distinct k, and we can use any k multiple times.\n\n        Example: p=1: we use one k=2 -> dp[1] = 2.\n                 p=2: we use two k=2 -> dp[2] = 2+2 = 4, or we can use one k=3? but T_3=3 which is >2, so we cannot. So dp[2]=4.\n\n        However, wait: is there a representation for p=2? Yes, two SCCs of size 2.\n\n        But note: the above DP considers each triangular number as a coin. We are iterating over k from 2 to k_max (until t<=p). Then we update dp[j] for each j from t to p.\n\n        But the problem: we are asked for the minimum number of nodes (n) for the graph, which is dp[p]. Then the second part: among all graphs with n nodes (the minimal n) that are p-reachable, what is the maximum number of unidirectional pairs?\n\n        What is a unidirectional pair? \n          (u, v) is unidirectional if: \n            u != v, there is a path from u to v, and there are no paths from v to u.\n\n        How to count unidirectional pairs?\n\n        In our graph, we break the nodes into SCCs. Let the SCCs be C1, C2, ..., Cm (each Ci is a set of nodes). Then we can arrange the SCCs in a topological order (since the graph is directed and acyclic on the SCCs). Then the entire graph is a DAG of SCCs.\n\n        Now, what are the pairs (u, v) (ordered) that are unidirectional?\n\n        Conditions for an ordered pair (u, v):\n          - There is a path from u to v, but no path from v to u.\n\n        This can happen in two scenarios:\n\n          Case 1: u and v are in the same SCC. Then they are mutually reachable, so this is not unidirectional.\n\n          Case 2: u and v are in different SCCs. Then the existence of a path from u to v means that in the topological order, the SCC containing u must come before the SCC containing v. Similarly, for the reverse. But note: if we have a path from u to v, then there is no path from v to u because the topological order is strict (if u's SCC is before v's, then no edge from v's SCC to u's). So in this case, the pair (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\n          However, wait: if the graph is built by connecting the SCCs in a chain (like a total order) then every pair (u, v) with u in an earlier SCC and v in a later SCC is unidirectional. But note: we can also have multiple edges between SCCs? Actually, in the standard condensation of a directed graph, we collapse each SCC into a node and the edges go from one SCC to another. But note: the original graph must be built arbitrarily. However, to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we would want as many pairs (u, v) as possible that have a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n          But note: the graph must be built with the minimal n (the set of SCCs and their sizes). However, we are free to arrange the edges arbitrarily as long as the mutual reachability condition is met (exactly p pairs). \n\n          How do we maximize the unidirectional pairs?\n\n          Let the graph have m SCCs (with sizes k1, k2, ..., km). Then the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v) is n*(n-1). The pairs that are either mutual (mutually reachable) or unidirectional are disjoint.\n\n          The mutually reachable pairs are the ones within the same SCC. The total mutual pairs (for u<v) is p. But note: the problem counts (u, v) with u < v. However, the unidirectional pairs are defined for any u != v. So we have to consider both (u, v) and (v, u) separately.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: an ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, there is a path from u to v, and no path from v to u.\n\n          So the entire set of ordered pairs (u, v) (with u != v) is partitioned into:\n            - Mutual: both (u, v) and (v, u) are present (then they are counted in the p-reachability only once for the unordered pair (u, v) with u<v, but note: the condition for p-reachability is defined by the unordered pairs (u<v) that are mutually reachable. However, the mutual condition requires both (u->v) and (v->u) to exist.\n\n          But note: the problem counts the unidirectional pairs separately. And the graph must have exactly p mutually reachable unordered pairs (with u<v). \n\n          The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) (with u != v) is n*(n-1). \n\n          Now, how many of these are mutual? For an unordered pair {u, v} (with u<v) that is mutually reachable, it contributes two ordered pairs (u, v) and (v, u) that are mutual. But wait, the definition of mutual reachability for an unordered pair {u, v} (with u<v) requires both (u->v) and (v->u) to exist. Then the two ordered pairs (u, v) and (v, u) are not unidirectional. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v) is n*(n-1). \n\n          The mutual ordered pairs are: for each SCC of size k, the number of mutual ordered pairs is k*(k-1) (because for each ordered pair (u, v) with u != v in the SCC, both directions are present). But wait, no: the definition of mutual reachability for an unordered pair (u, v) (with u<v) is that there is a path from u to v and from v to u. In an SCC, every ordered pair (u, v) (with u != v) is unidirectional? No, in an SCC, for any two distinct nodes u and v, both (u->v) and (v->u) are present. So the ordered pairs (u, v) and (v, u) are both mutual? Actually, no: the definition of unidirectional requires the opposite direction to be absent. So in an SCC, a pair (u, v) is not unidirectional.\n\n          Now, consider pairs (u, v) that are not in the same SCC. Then, as explained, the graph being a DAG of SCCs (in topological order) implies that if we have a path from u to v, then there is no path from v to u (unless u and v are in the same SCC, which they aren't). Therefore, the ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if and only if u is in an earlier SCC and v in a later one.\n\n          However, we can arrange the edges arbitrarily between the SCCs? Actually, we must have a DAG of the SCCs. But to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we want as many ordered pairs (u, v) as possible that are in different SCCs and with u in an earlier SCC than v. \n\n          How many such pairs? \n\n            Total ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v: n*(n-1)\n\n            Minus the mutual pairs: which are the ordered pairs (u, v) with u and v in the same SCC. For an SCC of size k, there are k*(k-1) ordered pairs (both directions) that are mutual? Actually, no: the mutual condition is symmetric. For an SCC, every ordered pair (u, v) (with u != v) is mutual? \n\n            Actually, the definition of mutual reachability is that there is a path from u to v and from v to u. In an SCC, yes. So for an SCC of size k, the number of ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v) is k*(k-1) and all of them are mutual (so they are not unidirectional). \n\n            Additionally, we must account for the fact that the graph must be built so that there are no other mutual pairs. But note: the condition for p-reachability is that the total number of unordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that are mutually reachable is p. This is equivalent to: the total number of mutual ordered pairs (for u != v) is 2*p (because each unordered pair {u, v} (with u<v) that is mutually reachable gives two ordered pairs: (u, v) and (v, u)).\n\n            However, wait: the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" -> so they are counting the unordered pairs (with u<v) that are mutually reachable. Therefore, the total mutual ordered pairs (considering both directions) is 2*p.\n\n            Then the unidirectional pairs are the remaining ordered pairs (u != v) that are not mutual. \n\n            So the total number of unidirectional pairs = n*(n-1) - 2*p.\n\n            But wait: is that always true? \n\n            Let me check with an example: p=0, n=0 -> then n*(n-1)=0, 2*p=0 -> unidirectional=0. Correct.\n\n            Example: n=2, p=1 (one SCC of size 2). Then total ordered pairs = 2*1=2. Then unidirectional pairs = 2 - 2*1 = 0. Correct, because the two ordered pairs (u1->u2) and (u2->u1) are mutual.\n\n            Example: n=3, p=1 (one SCC of size 2 and one isolated node). Then the mutual pairs: only the one SCC of size 2: which has 2 mutual ordered pairs (the two directions). Then the total ordered pairs is 3*2=6. Then unidirectional pairs = 6 - 2*1 = 4.\n\n            Now, let's list the graph: \n                SCC1: {node0, node1} (size2) and node2 (isolated).\n                The mutual pairs: (0,1) and (1,0) -> two.\n                The other pairs: \n                  (0,2): if we connect from node0 to node2, then we have a path from node0 to node2, but no path from node2 to node0 (since node2 is isolated). Similarly, (1,2) and (2,0), (2,1). \n\n                But note: we must arrange the graph so that the entire graph is p-reachable (which is p=1). The condition for p-reachability is that the total number of unordered pairs (u<v) that are mutually reachable is 1. Here, we have one unordered pair (0,1) (since 0<1) that is mutually reachable. \n\n                Now, we can choose the edges arbitrarily as long as we don't create additional mutual pairs. We cannot create a mutual pair between node0 and node2 because they are not in the same SCC. Similarly, we cannot create a mutual pair between node1 and node2.\n\n                But note: we can have edges from node0 to node2 and from node1 to node2. Then the pairs (0,2) and (1,2) are unidirectional (from node0 to node2 and node1 to node2). Similarly, we can have edges from node2 to node0 and node2 to node1? But then we would create mutual pairs? \n\n                However, the condition for p-reachability is only about the unordered pairs (u<v) that are mutually reachable. We must not have any other unordered pair (u<v) that is mutually reachable.\n\n                So we must avoid having a path from node2 to node0 and node2 to node1? Actually, if we have an edge from node2 to node0, then the unordered pair (node2, node0) (which is (2,0) and since node2>node0, we consider the unordered pair (min(node2,node0), max(node2,node0)) = (0,2) and check if they are mutually reachable. But note: the condition is for u < v. So we consider (0,2): we have a path from 0 to 2 (if we built it) and from 2 to 0? Then (0,2) would become mutually reachable, which is not allowed.\n\n                Therefore, we cannot have a path from node2 to node0. Similarly, we cannot have a path from node2 to node1. \n\n                So the graph must have edges from node0 to node2 and node1 to node2 (and not vice versa). Then the unidirectional pairs are:\n                  (0,2): yes\n                  (1,2): yes\n                  (2,0): no (because no path from 2 to 0)\n                  (2,1): no\n                  (0,1): mutual (already counted in p)\n                  (1,0): mutual\n\n                So the unidirectional pairs are (0,2) and (1,2) -> 2.\n\n                But according to the formula: n=3, p=1 -> 3*2 - 2*1 = 6-2=4. We only got 2.\n\n            Why the discrepancy? \n\n            The formula: total ordered pairs (u != v) is 6. The mutual pairs (ordered) are 2 (the two directions of (0,1)). Then the remaining 4 ordered pairs are unidirectional? But we only found 2.\n\n            The issue: the definition of unidirectional requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. In our graph, we have edges from node0 to node2 and node1 to node2. Then the pairs (0,2) and (1,2) are unidirectional. But what about (2,0) and (2,1)? They are absent (no edge) so they are not unidirectional because the condition requires a path from u to v. \n\n            However, the condition for unidirectional is: there exists a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. \n\n            We did not consider pairs (0,2) and (1,2) as unidirectional? Actually, we did: they are. \n\n            But wait: what about (0,1) and (1,0)? They are mutual. \n\n            And (0,2) and (2,0): (0,2) is unidirectional, (2,0) is not because there is no path from 2 to 0.\n\n            Similarly, (1,2) is unidirectional, (2,1) is not.\n\n            Then why is the total unidirectional pairs 2, but the formula gave 4?\n\n            The formula: n*(n-1) - 2*p = 3*2 - 2*1 = 6-2 = 4.\n\n            But the actual unidirectional pairs are 2.\n\n            What is the flaw?\n\n            The flaw: the mutual pairs are only the pairs within the same SCC. The pairs between different SCCs are not necessarily unidirectional. In fact, we can control the edges between SCCs arbitrarily (as long as we don't create mutual pairs). \n\n            However, note: the definition of mutual reachability requires a path in both directions. Between two different SCCs, if we have a path from u to v and from v to u, then they should be in the same SCC (by definition). So we must avoid having both directions.\n\n            But in our example, we did not put any edge from node2 to node0 or node2 to node1, so we avoided that.\n\n            Then why does the formula use 2*p for the mutual pairs? That counts the ordered pairs that are mutual. In the example, the mutual pairs (ordered) are (0,1) and (1,0) -> 2, so 2*p=2, which is correct.\n\n            Then the total ordered pairs is 6. The unidirectional pairs should be 6 - 2 = 4? But we only have 2.\n\n            Now, let's list all 6 ordered pairs:\n\n                (0,1): mutual\n                (0,2): unidirectional (path from 0 to 2, no path from 2 to 0)\n                (1,0): mutual\n                (1,2): unidirectional\n                (2,0): no path from 2 to 0 -> not unidirectional (requires a path from 2 to 0 to be considered, but we don't have that, and also the condition requires the existence of a path from u to v; here u=2, v=0: no path, so not unidirectional)\n                (2,1): no path from 2 to 1 -> not unidirectional\n\n            So we have two unidirectional pairs: (0,2) and (1,2). \n\n            But wait: the formula subtracts the mutual pairs (which are 2) from the total 6, leaving 4. But the unidirectional pairs are only 2.\n\n            The mistake: the formula is not accounting for the fact that the mutual pairs are only the ones within the same SCC, but the rest (the pairs between different SCCs) can be either unidirectional or not (if there is no path in one direction). \n\n            Actually, the entire set of ordered pairs (u != v) is partitioned into:\n              - Mutual: pairs (u, v) for which there is a path from u to v and from v to u. These are exactly the pairs within the same SCC (both directions) and nothing else.\n\n            Then the remaining ordered pairs are those that are not mutual. However, the definition of unidirectional requires:\n              - There is a path from u to v, and no path from v to u.\n\n            The remaining pairs (non-mutual) also include pairs that have no path in either direction. \n\n            Therefore, we cannot simply subtract 2*p from the total to get the unidirectional pairs.\n\n        Let's reexamine:\n\n          Total ordered pairs (u != v): n*(n-1)\n\n          Among these, the mutual pairs are 2*p (because for each unordered pair (u<v) that is mutually reachable, we have two ordered pairs: (u, v) and (v, u)).\n\n          The remaining pairs (n*(n-1) - 2*p) are either unidirectional or not connected (no path in either direction). \n\n          To maximize the unidirectional pairs, we want to arrange the graph so that as many as possible of the remaining pairs are unidirectional.\n\n          How to arrange the edges between the SCCs?\n\n          We have a DAG of SCCs. The entire graph is built by connecting the SCCs in a topological order. We can choose the edges arbitrarily as long as the topological order is preserved (to avoid creating mutual paths between different SCCs). \n\n          Then, for two nodes u in SCC i and v in SCC j:\n\n            If i < j (in topological order), then we can have an edge from u to v (thus making the pair (u, v) unidirectional) but we cannot have an edge from v to u (because that would create a cycle, and then the SCCs would merge). \n\n          However, we are allowed to put as many edges as we want as long as we don't violate the SCC structure (we already fixed the SCCs). \n\n          But note: the problem doesn't fix the internal edges of the SCCs. We only fixed the sizes of the SCCs (the minimal n). Now, to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we can choose the edges between the SCCs arbitrarily (subject to the DAG condition). \n\n          The DAG condition: if we have a topological order of the SCCs, then we can put edges from every node in an earlier SCC to every node in a later SCC, and no edges the other way. Then, for any two nodes u in SCC i and v in SCC j:\n\n            If i < j, then there is a path from u to v (if we put all the edges from i to j) and no path from v to u (because the topological order is preserved). Similarly, if i > j, then there is no",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and there exists a path from u to v and from v to u.\n   - The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes (n) such that the sum of the triangular numbers (k*(k-1)/2 for each strongly connected component (SCC) of size k) equals p.\n   - For the second part, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (ordered pairs (u, v) where u ≠ v, there is a path from u to v but no path from v to u) in the graph with n nodes.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triangular Numbers**: The number of mutual reachability pairs within an SCC of size k is given by the triangular number T_k = k*(k-1)/2. The problem reduces to representing p as a sum of such triangular numbers while minimizing the total number of nodes (sum of k's).\n   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of nodes needed to achieve exactly i mutual reachability pairs. The solution involves iterating over possible triangular numbers and updating the DP array accordingly.\n   - **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal n is found, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by considering all ordered pairs (u, v) where u ≠ v and subtracting the mutual pairs (2*p). However, not all non-mutual pairs are unidirectional; only those with a directed path from u to v but not vice versa. To maximize these, we arrange the graph in a DAG structure where edges flow strictly from earlier to later topological components.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **DP for Minimal Nodes**: The DP approach efficiently computes the minimal nodes by leveraging the properties of triangular numbers and their sums.\n   - **Topological Arrangement**: After determining the minimal n, the graph is structured as a DAG of SCCs in topological order to maximize unidirectional pairs.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The DP approach runs in O(p * k_max), where k_max is the largest integer such that T_k ≤ p. Given p can be up to 200,000, this is feasible with optimizations.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The DP array requires O(p) space, which is acceptable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    p = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    dp = [10**9] * (p+1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    k = 2\n    while True:\n        t_val = k*(k-1)//2\n        if t_val > p:\n            break\n        for j in range(t_val, p+1):\n            if dp[j-t_val] != 10**9:\n                if dp[j] > dp[j-t_val] + k:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j-t_val] + k\n        k += 1\n        \n    n_nodes = dp[p]\n    \n    total_ordered_pairs = n_nodes * (n_nodes - 1)\n    mutual_ordered_pairs = 2 * p\n    \n    # But note: not every non-mutual pair is unidirectional. \n    # In fact, the maximum unidirectional pairs we can have is achieved when we arrange the graph as a DAG of SCCs in topological order, \n    # and we put all possible edges from earlier components to later ones.\n    # Then, the number of unidirectional pairs is the total number of ordered pairs between different components (which is total_ordered_pairs - mutual_ordered_pairs) \n    # but wait: actually, the mutual pairs are only within the same component, and the remaining pairs (between different components) are all unidirectional if we ensure no reverse edges.\n    # However, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) is n_nodes*(n_nodes-1). \n    # The mutual pairs are 2*p (each unordered pair {u, v} with u < v and mutual reachability contributes two ordered pairs).\n    # The rest of the pairs (n_nodes*(n_nodes-1) - 2*p) are either unidirectional or disconnected.

The array is initialized with a large value except for `dp[0]` which is 0.\n4. **Triangular Number Calculation**: For each possible SCC size k, compute the corresponding triangular number T_k.
