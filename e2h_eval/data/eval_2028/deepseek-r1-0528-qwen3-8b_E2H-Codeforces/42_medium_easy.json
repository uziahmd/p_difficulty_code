Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of files and then a list of file sizes.\n We have two progress bars:\n   - First (current file): floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file i and having copied x bytes of it (from 0 to a_i)\n   - Second (total): floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_sum)\n\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that there exists a moment (i.e., at some byte x in some file i) \n where both progress bars show the same integer.\n\n Note: The moment is after copying a whole number of bytes (from 0 to a_i for the current file, and we consider all files).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so we consider every integer step from 0 up to the size of the current file.\n\n But note: n <= 100, and each a_i <= 1000, so total steps is at most 100*1000 = 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over every single byte for each file if we do naive simulation because 100*1000 = 100000 is acceptable for a modern computer.\n\n But note: the example input may be small. Let's try to think of an efficient way.\n\n However, we can simulate by iterating over each file and within each file, iterate over the bytes (or use math to jump to the next change?).\n\n But note: the second progress bar depends on the total sum so far. So we must consider the entire history.\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n We are only interested in the set S of numbers from 0 to 100 that occur simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment.\n\n We can simulate the entire process by going file by file and then for each file, for each possible percentage p that might appear in the first progress bar (which must be from 0 to 100) and check if at the same time the second progress bar also equals p.\n\n However, note: the first progress bar in file i at x bytes: p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i) must be an integer between 0 and 100. But note that x goes from 0 to a_i (inclusive). \n\n Similarly, the second progress bar: total_bytes_so_far = (sum of previous files) + x, and total_bytes = total_sum. Then p2 = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum) = floor(100 * (prefix_sum[i-1] + x) / total_sum)\n\n Conditions for a fixed file i and a fixed x (0 <= x <= a_i) and fixed p:\n   Condition1: floor(100*x/a_i) = p\n   Condition2: floor(100*(prefix_sum[i-1]+x)/total_sum) = p\n\n However, note that we are required to output all p in [0,100] that appear at least once.\n\n But note: the same p might appear multiple times, but we only need to know if it appears at least once.\n\n How to avoid iterating over every x (which would be 1000 per file, and 100 files -> 100000 iterations) is acceptable since 100000 is not too many.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and the list of file sizes.\n 2. Calculate the total_sum = sum(a_i)\n 3. Precompute prefix sums: prefix[i] = a0+a1+...+a_{i-1} (for the i-th file, the previous files' total is prefix[i])\n    Actually, for the i-th file (0-indexed), the previous files' total is prefix[i] = sum(a_0 to a_{i-1})\n\n 4. We'll create a set `results` to collect all p (from 0 to 100) that satisfy the condition at some point.\n\n 5. For each file index i (from 0 to n-1):\n      Let current_file_size = a[i]\n      Let prev_total = prefix[i]   (if i==0 then 0)\n      Then for x from 0 to current_file_size (inclusive):\n\n          p1 = (100 * x) // current_file_size   (since floor division by current_file_size, but note: 100*x might be fractional, but we use integer floor)\n\n          total_so_far = prev_total + x\n          p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total_sum   # This is integer floor division.\n\n          If p1 == p2, then add p1 to the results set.\n\n 6. Also note: we must consider that the same p might be added multiple times, so using a set is good.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the progress bars update after each byte, so x=0 (start) is included.\n\n However, note: when x=0, then p1 = 0, and p2 = (100 * prev_total) // total_sum. \n   But at the very beginning, before any file, we have x=0 and prev_total=0, so p2=0. So 0 will always be included.\n\n 8. After processing all files, we have a set of p's. Then we convert this set to a sorted list and output each number on a new line.\n\n BUT WAIT: Is this correct?\n\n Example: Input ['1\\n6'] -> one file of size 6, total_sum=6.\n\n   i=0, prev_total=0, current_file_size=6.\n   x from 0 to 6:\n\n   x=0: p1 = (0//6)=0, p2 = (0//6)=0 -> record 0.\n   x=1: p1 = (100*1)//6 = 100//6 = 16, p2 = (100*(0+1))//6 = 100//6 = 16 -> record 16.\n   x=2: p1 = (200//6)=33, p2=(200//6)=33 -> record 33.\n   x=3: p1= (300//6)=50, p2=50 -> record 50.\n   x=4: p1= (400//6)=66, p2= (400//6)=66 -> record 66.\n   x=5: p1= (500//6)=83, p2= (500//6)=83 -> record 83.\n   x=6: p1= (600//6)=100, p2= (600//6)=100 -> record 100.\n\n So the output would be: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100. Which matches the example.\n\n However, wait: the example output is: \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\"\n\n But note: the example input was given as a string array. The example input is provided as:\n\n   ['1\\n6', ...]\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   Input format: \n        first line: n\n        second line: n integers\n\n So we should read from stdin.\n\n But wait, the example has multiple test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Input\n     In the first line, one integer n.\n\n   Then the next line: n integers.\n\n And the example input is given as:\n\n     ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...]\n\n However, the problem is asking for a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n So let's read the input properly.\n\n However, note: the example output is provided as a list of strings, each string being a line.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n from stdin.\n   Step 2: Read the next line and split to get the list of integers.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: \"1\\n6\"\n\n   So:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   However, the example input is given as a string representation of a list. But the problem says the input is provided as described.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \n        The first line: n\n        The second line: n integers\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   But note: the example input is provided in the example as a string. But in the real competition, the input comes from standard input.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", meaning we should read from stdin.\n\n   Let me write code accordingly.\n\n But wait, what if the second line has more than n integers? According to the problem, there are exactly n integers.\n\n   We assume the input is well-formed.\n\n   Now, let's test with the second example: n=2, a_list=[100,500]\n\n   total_sum = 600\n   prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = 100.\n\n   File0: size=100, prev_total=0.\n        x from 0 to 100:\n            p1 = (100*x)//100 -> x (because 100*x//100 = x, but wait: actually, (100*x)//100 is floor(100*x/100)=floor(x)=x (since x is integer). \n            But note: the problem uses floor, and x is integer so it's exact.\n\n            p2 = (100*(0+x))//600 = (100*x)//600.\n\n            So for x from 0 to 100, we have:\n                p1 = x (which is from 0 to 100)\n                p2 = (100*x)//600\n\n            We need to check for which x: x == (100*x)//600 ?\n\n            Actually, no: the condition is that the two percentages must be equal.\n\n            Condition: x == (100*x)//600   ?\n\n            But note: (100*x)//600 is floor(100*x/600) = floor(x/6) (because 100/600 = 1/6). So we require x = floor(x/6) ?\n\n            That would only hold for x=0.\n\n            But wait, let me recalc:\n\n            Condition: p1 = x, p2 = floor(100*x/600) = floor(x/6) [but wait: 100*x/600 = x/6, and then floor(x/6) is the value].\n\n            So we need x = floor(x/6). \n\n            Since x is an integer, floor(x/6) is the greatest integer <= x/6.\n\n            This equation holds only for x=0, because for x>=1, floor(x/6) <= x/6 < x (unless x=0).\n\n            So during the first file, only 0 is recorded.\n\n        Now, file1: size=500, prev_total=100.\n\n            x from 0 to 500:\n\n            p1 = (100*x)//500\n            p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n            We need to check for which x: (100*x)//500 == (100*(100+x))//600\n\n            Let p = (100*x)//500. Then we require p = (100*(100+x))//600.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate.\n\n            But note: the example output is: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n            So we must have recorded 95,96,97,98,99,100 during the second file.\n\n            Let me compute for x from 0 to 500:\n\n            We are interested in the values of p that are in the range [0,100] and that satisfy the equation.\n\n            However, note: the example output includes 0 (which we got from the first file) and then these numbers.\n\n            Why 95,96,...100? Let's check for x near the end.\n\n            At the end of the second file, x=500: \n                p1 = (100*500)//500 = 100\n                p2 = (100*(100+500))//600 = (100*600)//600 = 100.\n\n            Now, how about x=465? (just an example)\n\n            p1 = (100*465)//500 = 93\n            p2 = (100*(100+465))//600 = (100*565)//600 = 56500//600 = 94.166... -> floor to 94 -> not 93.\n\n            Let me check x=480:\n                p1 = (100*480)//500 = 96\n                p2 = (100*(100+480))//600 = 58000//600 = 96.666... -> floor to 96 -> so 96 is recorded.\n\n            Similarly, x=470:\n                p1 = (100*470)//500 = 94\n                p2 = (100*(100+470))//600 = 57000//600 = 95 -> not 94.\n\n            x=475:\n                p1 = (100*475)//500 = 95\n                p2 = (100*(100+475))//600 = 57500//600 = 95.833... -> floor to 95 -> record 95.\n\n            x=479:\n                p1 = (100*479)//500 = 95.8 -> floor 95\n                p2 = (100*(100+479))//600 = 57900//600 = 96.5 -> floor 96 -> not 95.\n\n            So we see that the same p might appear multiple times and also we must check every x.\n\n            The problem says: \"exists a moment\" so even if we get the same p multiple times, we only record it once.\n\n            We must iterate over every x.\n\n            But note: the total steps is 100000 (100*1000) worst-case, which is acceptable.\n\n 9. Code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the third example: n=4, [1000,2,2,998] -> output: 0,50,99,100.\n\n  Let's do a quick check:\n\n    total_sum = 1000+2+2+998 = 2002.\n\n    We are going to simulate 1000+2+2+998 = 2002 steps. This is acceptable.\n\n  But wait: the example output says 0,50,99,100.\n\n  We must record 50 and 99.\n\n  Let me check:\n\n    During the first file (1000 bytes): \n        We need to see if at some x, (100*x)//1000 = (100*(x))//2002.\n\n        For x=500: \n            p1 = (100*500)//1000 = 50\n            p2 = (100*500)//2002 = 50000//2002 ≈ 24.97 -> 24, so not 50.\n\n        During the first file, we don't get 50.\n\n    Then the second file: size=2, prev_total=1000.\n        x=0: p1=0, p2= (100*1000)//2002 ≈ 49.9 -> 49 -> not 0? Wait, but 0 is already recorded from the beginning or the start of the first file? Actually, at the very beginning (x=0 of first file) we had 0, and then during the first file we had 0 at the beginning and then increased.\n\n        Now, we are at the second file, x=0: p1=0, p2= (100*(1000))//2002 = 100000//2002 ≈ 49.95 -> 49, so 0 != 49.\n\n        x=1: p1 = (100*1)//2 = 50, p2 = (100*(1000+1))//2002 = 100100//2002 ≈ 50.00 -> 50. So we record 50.\n\n        Then the third file: size=2, prev_total=1002.\n            x=0: p1=0, p2 = (100*1002)//2002 = 100200//2002 = 50.05 -> 50 -> not 0.\n            x=1: p1 = (100*1)//2 = 50, p2 = (100*(1002+1))//2002 = 100300//2002 ≈ 50.1 -> 50 -> record 50 again (but we already have 50).\n\n        Then the fourth file: size=998, prev_total=1004.\n            We are looking for 99 and 100.\n\n            At the end (x=998): p1 = (100*998)//998 = 100, p2 = (100*(1004+998))//2002 = (100*2002)//2002=100 -> record 100.\n\n            How about 99?\n            We need to find an x (from 0 to 998) such that:\n                p1 = (100*x)//998 = 99\n                p2 = (100*(1004+x))//2002 = 99\n\n            Condition for p1: (100*x)//998 = 99  => 99 <= (100*x)/998 < 100\n            => 99 * 998 / 100 <= x < 100 * 998 / 100\n            => 99 * 9.98 <= x < 998\n            => 988.02 <= x < 998 -> so x must be at least 989.\n\n            Now, for p2: (100*(1004+x))//2002 = 99\n            => 99 <= (100*(1004+x))/2002 < 100\n            => 99 * 2002 / 100 <= 1004+x < 100 * 2002 / 100\n            => 1981.98 <= 1004+x < 2002\n            => 1981.98 - 1004 <= x < 2002 - 1004\n            => 977.98 <= x < 998\n\n            So x must be in [978, 997] (integer).\n\n            But from p1 we require x>=989, so x in [989,997].\n\n            Now, let's check for x=989:\n                p1 = (100*989)//998 = 98900//998 = 99.098... -> floor is 99 -> ok.\n                p2 = (100*(1004+989))//2002 = (100*1993)//2002 = 199300//2002 = 99.55 -> floor 99 -> ok.\n\n            So 99 is recorded.\n\n 10. Therefore, the simulation works.\n\n However, note: we are iterating over every x from 0 to a_i (inclusive) for each file. The worst-case total operations is the sum of the a_i, which is at most 100*1000 = 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the problem says n<=100 and each a_i<=1000, so the maximum total bytes is 100*1000=100000, and we are iterating 100000 times. This is acceptable in Python.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided as a string array in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n Code:\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)   # prefix[0]=0, prefix[i] for i in [1..n] is the sum of first i-1 files.\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a_list[i-1]\n    # But wait, for the i-th file (0-indexed) we need the sum of all files before it, which is prefix[i] = sum(a_list[:i])\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute on the fly without storing the entire prefix array? But we can also precompute:\n\n    prefix = [0]*n\n    if n>0:\n        prefix[0] = 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a_list[i-1]\n    Then for the i-th file (index i), the previous total is prefix[i].\n\n    But note: for the last file, i=n-1, prefix[n-1] = sum(a_list[:n-1])\n\n    However, we can also compute the prefix for the i-th file as the cumulative sum of the first i files, but then for the i-th file we need the cumulative sum of the first i-1 files.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        prefix = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # process file i with previous total = prefix\n            # then update prefix += a_list[i]\n\n        This way we don't need to store the entire prefix array, just the running total.\n\n    But the above method is more efficient in terms of space.\n\n    Revised plan:\n\n        total_sum = sum(a_list)\n        prefix_sum = 0\n        results = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            current_file = a_list[i]\n            # Now, for x from 0 to current_file (inclusive)\n            for x in range(0, current_file+1):\n                # First progress bar: floor(100*x/current_file)\n                p1 = (100 * x) // current_file\n\n                # Second progress bar: floor(100*(prefix_sum + x) / total_sum)\n                total_so_far = prefix_sum + x\n                p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total_sum\n\n                if p1 == p2:\n                    results.add(p1)\n\n            # Update prefix_sum for the next file\n            prefix_sum += current_file\n\n        # Now, we have collected all p in the set `results`\n        # Convert to sorted list and output each on a new line.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the first file: prefix_sum starts at 0, then we update to current_file.\n\n    But wait: the example with one file: [6] -> \n        total_sum=6, prefix_sum starts at 0.\n        i=0: current_file=6, then x from 0 to 6.\n        Then update prefix_sum to 6.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    But note: the second example: n=2, [100,500] -> \n        total_sum=600\n        i=0: current_file=100, prefix_sum=0.\n            x from 0 to 100: only x=0 gives 0, then update prefix_sum to 100.\n        i=1: current_file=500, prefix_sum=100.\n            x from 0 to 500: we check and record 95,96,...,100.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the progress bars update after each byte, including the very beginning (0% for both). We are including x=0 for every file.\n\n    But note: the very beginning (before any file) is captured by the first file's x=0. Then the next file's x=0 is after the first file is done (so we have the progress from the first file and then the second file hasn't started). \n\n    But the problem says: after each byte. The initial state (0%) is at the very beginning (x=0 of the first file). Then after the first file is done, the second file starts and at x=0 of the second file, we are at the end of the first file. So the second file's x=0 is the same as the first file's x=100? Actually, no: the second file's x=0 means we have not copied any byte of the second file, but we have the entire first file.\n\n    The problem states: \n        After copying a byte x (from 0 to a_i) of file i, the first progress bar shows floor(100*x/a_i) and the second shows floor(100*(previous_files_total + x)/total_sum).\n\n    So the state at the end of the first file (x=100 for the first file) is captured, and then the second file's x=0 is a separate state (the first file is complete and the second file hasn't started). \n\n    But note: the problem says \"after each byte\", meaning that the update happens after each byte is copied. The initial state (0%) is included (at the very beginning, which is before the first byte of the first file). Then we update after each byte.\n\n    Our simulation for the first file includes the state at the beginning (x=0) and then after each byte until x=100 (for the first file). Then for the second file, we include x=0 (which is the state after the first file is completely copied and no byte of the second file) and then up to x=500.\n\n    This matches the problem.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not say that the progress bars are updated at the moment of finishing a file. But our simulation does capture the state at the end of a file (when x = a_i) and then the next file starts from x=0 (with the previous file's total).\n\n    This is consistent.\n\n    But wait: is the state at the end of a file (100% in the current file) the same as the state at the beginning of the next file? No, because the next file's first byte (x=0) has the same total_so_far as the previous file's end (because x=0 plus the previous total). \n\n    However, note: the condition for the first progress bar in the next file: at x=0, it's 0%. The second progress bar: floor(100*(prev_total)/total_sum) which is the same as the state at the end of the previous file (if we consider the previous file's last byte: x_prev = a_prev, then total_so_far_prev = prev_total + a_prev, but wait, no: the state at the end of the previous file (last byte) is the same as the state at the beginning of the next file (first byte)? \n\n    Actually, no: the state at the end of the previous file (last byte) is:\n        First progress bar: floor(100*a_prev / a_prev) = 100.\n        Second progress bar: floor(100*(prev_total + a_prev)/total_sum) = floor(100* (total of previous files including the last one) / total_sum) = floor(100*(total_so_far_prev) / total_sum)\n\n    The state at the beginning of the next file (first byte, x=0) is:\n        First progress bar: 0.\n        Second progress bar: floor(100*(prev_total + 0)/total_sum) = floor(100*(prev_total)/total_sum)\n\n    Here, note: the total_so_far at the end of the previous file is (prev_total + a_prev) and at the beginning of the next file is prev_total (the same as the previous file's total without the last file's bytes). \n\n    But wait, we defined prev_total for the next file as the total of the files before the next file, which is the same as the total_so_far at the end of the last file without the last file's bytes? \n\n    Actually, in our code:\n\n        We start with prefix_sum = 0.\n        For the first file: we use prefix_sum = 0, then update prefix_sum to 0 + a0.\n        For the second file: we use prefix_sum = a0, then update to a0+a1.\n\n    But the state at the end of the first file (last byte) is captured in the first file's loop (x from 0 to a0) and then we update prefix_sum to a0.\n\n    The state at the beginning of the second file (x=0) uses prefix_sum = a0 (which is the total of the first file). Then the second progress bar at the beginning of the second file is floor(100*(a0)/total_sum).\n\n    However, the problem says the second progress bar is updated after each byte. The state at the end of the first file (x=a0) is captured, and then the next update is at the second file's first byte (x=0) which is a different total_so_far (a0 instead of a0+a1).\n\n    But wait, the problem says: the second progress bar is floor(100*(a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}+x)/total_sum). For the second file (i=1, 0-indexed i=1) and x=0, then the total_so_far = a0 (from the first file) + 0 (from the second) = a0.\n\n    So the update at the beginning of the second file (x=0) is the same as the state at the end of the first file? \n\n    Actually, no: the state at the end of the first file (last byte) is captured in the first file's loop (x=a0) and then the second file's first byte (x=0) is a distinct update (because it's the next update). \n\n    The problem says: \"after each byte\". The last byte of the first file is one update, and then the first byte of the second file is the next update.\n\n    But note: the second file's first byte is the very next update. So the state at the end of the first file (x=a0) and the state at the beginning of the second file (x=0) are two consecutive updates.\n\n    However, the problem does not require the same p to appear at two different times. We are only concerned with whether a p appears at least once.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But note: the example with two files [100,500] did record 0 from the first file (x=0) and then from the second file (x=0) we did not record 0 again (because at the second file's x=0, the second progress bar was floor(100*100/600)=49, so 0!=49). \n\n    However, we did record 0 from the first file's x=0.\n\n    So we are good.\n\n    One more note: the problem says \"Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания\", meaning we must output the numbers in increasing order.\n\n    We are storing them in a set and then sorting.\n\n    Let's run the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: [6] -> outputs [0,16,33,50,66,83,100] -> sorted is the same.\n\n    Example 2: [100,500] -> outputs [0,95,96,97,98,99,100] -> sorted is the same.\n\n    Example 3: [1000,2,2,998] -> outputs [0,50,99,100] -> sorted is the same.\n\n    Example 4: [170,130,400,256,30,100] -> outputs [0,17,43,44,84,90,99,100]\n\n    Now, let's check example 4: \n\n        total_sum = 170+130+400+256+30+100 = 1286.\n\n        We are to record 0,17,43,44,84,90,99,100.\n\n        We'll simulate the first file (170):\n            x=0: 0 -> record 0.\n            Then update prefix_sum=170.\n\n        Second file (130): \n            We are looking for 17,43,44, etc.\n\n            We need to check: \n                p1 = (100*x)//130\n                p2 = (100*(170+x))//1286\n\n            Let's check x=22: \n                p1 = (100*22)//130 = 2200//130 = 16.92 -> 16\n                p2 = (100*(170+22))//1286 = 19200//1286 ≈ 14.93 -> 14 -> not 16.\n\n            x=23: \n                p1 = (100*23)//130 = 2300//130 = 17.69 -> 17 -> record 17.\n                p2 = (100*(170+23))//1286 = 19300//1286 ≈ 14.99 -> 14 -> not 17.\n\n            Then we move to the third file, fourth file, etc.\n\n        It's going to be tedious. Instead, we trust the simulation.\n\n    However, note: the example output for the fourth example is provided.\n\n    But wait: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n    And the example output is:\n\n        ['0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n    We'll run the code on this input and see if we get these numbers.\n\n    We must ensure that we don't miss any p.\n\n    However, note: the set may contain duplicates, but we are using a set so duplicates are ignored.\n\n    The code is straightforward.\n\n    Let me run the fourth example manually for the first two files:\n\n        total_sum = 1286.\n\n        File0: 170 -> records 0.\n\n        File1: 130, with prefix_sum=170.\n\n            We need to check x from 0 to 130.\n\n            We are particularly interested in x=23 (recorded 17) and then maybe others.\n\n            But wait, the example output includes 17, so we must have recorded 17 at some x in the second file.\n\n            We did: x=23 gives p1=17, but p2=14, so not recorded.\n\n            Then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that there exists a moment during the copying of files where both progress bars (current file progress and total progress) display the same percentage. The solution involves simulating the copying process byte by byte for each file and checking if the percentages match at any point.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires tracking two progress bars for each file being copied. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n2. **Intuition**: For each file, we simulate copying each byte (from 0 to the file size) and compute both progress values. If they match at any point, we record the percentage.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over each file and each possible byte count (from 0 to the file size). For each byte count, we calculate the current file's progress and the total progress. If they are equal, we add the percentage to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each byte of each file once. Given that there are up to 100 files, each with a maximum size of 1000 bytes, the total operations are 100 * 1000 = 100,000, which is efficient for modern computing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    results = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file = a_list[i]\n        for x in range(0, current_file + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // current_file\n            total_so_far = prefix_sum + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total_sum\n            if p1 == p2:\n                results.add(p1)\n        prefix_sum += current_file\n\n    sorted_results = sorted(results)\n    for num in sorted_results:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes. The first line is read as the number of files, and the second line is split into a list of integers representing file sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: The total sum of all file sizes is computed. A variable `prefix_sum` keeps track of the cumulative size of files processed before the current one. A set `results` stores unique percentages where both progress bars match.\n3. **Simulating File Copying**: For each file, the code iterates over each possible byte count (from 0 to the file size). For each byte count, it calculates the current file's progress (`p1`) and the total progress (`p2`). If they match, the percentage is added to the results set.\n4. **Output**: After processing all files, the results are sorted and printed in ascending order, ensuring each percentage is listed only once.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible moments during the copying process to identify matching progress percentages, leveraging straightforward arithmetic and iteration to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
