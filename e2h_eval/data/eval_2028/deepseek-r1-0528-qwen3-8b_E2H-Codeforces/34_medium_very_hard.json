And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let's recalc: the problem says \"average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\"\n\n But note: the example input has two weeks, so we are to compute the average of the two week averages?\n Actually, no: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n What is 9? It's the total sleep hours over the entire period divided by the total days? Or what?\n\n Let me read the example again: \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n The example doesn't show the calculation. But let's see:\n\n There are two weeks: \n   Week1: [3,4] -> sum=7, days=2\n   Week2: [4,7] -> sum=11, days=2\n\n Now, if we are to compute the average sleep time per week (considering each week individually and then averaging the weeks), \n then we would do: (7/2 + 11/2) / 2 = (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? That does not give 9.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the problem means: total sleep hours over the entire period divided by the total number of days in the entire period? \n But wait, there are 3 days and the total sleep is 3+4+7 = 14, then 14/3 is about 4.666..., not 9.\n\n Another possibility: the problem wants the average of the weekly averages? But then that would be (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n But the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me check the problem statement: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\"\n\n And they say: \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n Actually, the example output is provided as 9.0000000000.\n\n Wait, let me look at the sample outputs:\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output \"9.0000000000\"\n Example 2: Input \"1 1\\n10\" -> Output \"10.0000000000\"\n Example 3: Input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> Output \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n In the second example: n=1, k=1 -> one week of one day: average is 10.\n\n Now, how do we get 9 from the first example?\n\n Note: the problem says \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n But if we consider the entire period (all days) and then divide by the total days? Then for the first example: total days is 3, but we have two weeks (each week being 2 days). \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean: the average sleep time per day? Then total sleep is 14, and total days is 3, so 14/3 ≈ 4.666... which is not 9.\n\n Another interpretation: the average sleep time per week, but then the week is defined as k consecutive days. Then we have two weeks, and we want the average of the two week totals (without dividing by the number of days in the week)? Then:\n\n Week1: 7 (total hours for 2 days)\n Week2: 11 (total hours for 2 days)\n\n Then the average per week (as a total) is (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n So the problem is: we are to compute the average of the weekly sums (each week is the sum of k consecutive days) over all the weeks.\n\n Then, the answer is: (sum of all weekly sums) / (number of weeks)\n\n But note: the number of weeks is (n - k + 1).\n\n However, we can also compute the total sleep by considering that each day is counted in multiple weeks.\n\n Specifically, day i (0-indexed) is included in (k - i) weeks? Actually, the first day is included in (n - k + 1) weeks? No, more precisely:\n\n Each day i (from 0 to n-1) is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window:\n\n Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n We can compute the sum of all weekly sums by:\n\n   Let S = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}]\n   Let window_sum = sum(S[0:k])\n   Then for each subsequent window, subtract S[i] and add S[i+k] (if exists)\n\n Then the total sum of all weekly sums is the sum of the window_sums for all windows.\n\n Then the average is (total_sum_of_weekly_sums) / total_weeks.\n\n But note: the example [3,4,7] with k=2:\n   window1: 3+4 = 7\n   window2: 4+7 = 11\n   total_sum_of_weekly_sums = 7+11 = 18\n   total_weeks = 2\n   average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n Example 2: [10] with k=1: \n   window1: 10\n   total_sum_of_weekly_sums = 10\n   total_weeks = 1\n   average = 10.0\n\n Example 3: n=8, k=2, array = [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n   We need to compute 7 windows (since 8-2+1=7) and then the sum of these 7 window sums.\n\n   Let's compute the window sums:\n     [1,2] -> 3\n     [2,4] -> 6\n     [4,100000] -> 100004\n     [100000,123] -> 100123\n     [123,456] -> 579\n     [456,789] -> 1245\n     [789,1] -> 790\n\n   Sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n        3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n   Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n So the method is:\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n   We can use a sliding window to compute the sum of all window sums without having to store each window.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k and the list a.\n\n   Step 2: If k == 0: but note k>=1 so skip.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the initial window [0:k] and then slide.\n\n   However, note: we don't actually need to know each individual window's sum, we only need the total of all window sums.\n\n   How to compute the total of all window sums?\n\n   Notice: Each element a[i] appears in exactly (i+1) to (n-i-1) ? Actually, the number of windows that include a[i] is:\n\n      left_bound: from max(0, i-k+1) to i, but actually the window starts from 0 to n-k (inclusive) and must include i.\n\n      The condition for a window starting at j (0<=j<=n-k) to include a[i] is: j <= i <= j+k-1.\n\n      => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j>=0, j<=n-k.\n\n      So the number of windows that include a[i] is: \n          j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n          j_max = min(i, n-k)\n          count_i = j_max - j_min + 1\n\n   But wait, we don't need the count for the average per week, we need the total sum of the window sums.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n      total_window_sum = sum_{window} (sum of elements in window)\n\n      This is the same as: for each element a[i], it is added in every window that covers it.\n\n      So total_window_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of windows that include i)\n\n   And the number of windows that include i is: \n        left_count = i + 1   [because the window can start at any index from 0 to i] \n        right_count = n - i   [because the window must end by i+k-1 <= n-1 -> j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-k, and the window must start at most n-k, but also we require that the window ends at least at i, so the window must start at least i-k+1, but we cannot go beyond 0]\n\n   Actually, the correct way:\n\n        The window starts at j, and we require j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, and j>=0, j<=n-k.\n\n        => j <= i and j >= max(0, i-k+1) and j <= min(i, n-k)\n\n        So the number of j is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n   However, note: we can also think of the windows that include a[i] as:\n\n        The left boundary for j: j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        The right boundary for j: j_max = min(i, n - k)   [because the window must end at j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-k]\n\n        Then the count is: j_max - j_min + 1, provided that j_min <= j_max, otherwise 0.\n\n   But let's test with the example [3,4,7] (n=3, k=2):\n\n        For i=0: \n            j_min = max(0, 0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n            j_max = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n            count0 = 1 -> 3*1 = 3\n\n        For i=1:\n            j_min = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            j_max = min(1,1)=1\n            count1 = 1-0+1 = 2 -> 4*2 = 8\n\n        For i=2:\n            j_min = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            j_max = min(2,1)=1\n            count2 = 1-1+1 = 1 -> 7*1 = 7\n\n        Total = 3+8+7 = 18.\n\n   Then average = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        total_window_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n - k)   # because j must be <= n-k (since j+k-1 <= n-1 => j <= n-k) and j<=i, so high = min(i, n-k)\n            if low <= high:\n                count = high - low + 1\n                total_window_sum += a[i] * count\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_window_sum / total_weeks\n\n   But note: the above formula for the count is valid only if the window starting at j must be within [0, n-k] and j must be at most i and at least i-k+1.\n\n   However, we can also use the sliding window to compute the total_window_sum in O(n). \n\n   But note: n and k can be up to 200,000, so a loop of 200,000 is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the above method is O(n) and efficient.\n\n   However, let me test with the third example:\n\n        n=8, k=2, a = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n        We expect total_window_sum = 202750.\n\n        Let's compute for each i (0-indexed):\n\n        i=0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high = min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1 -> 1*1=1\n        i=1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high = min(1,6)=1 -> count=2 -> 2*2=4\n        i=2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high = min(2,6)=2 -> count=2 -> 4*2=8\n        i=3: low = max(0,3-2+1)=2, high = min(3,6)=3 -> count=2 -> 100000*2=200000\n        i=4: low = max(0,4-2+1)=3, high = min(4,6)=4 -> count=2 -> 123*2=246\n        i=5: low = max(0,5-2+1)=4, high = min(5,6)=5 -> count=2 -> 456*2=912\n        i=6: low = max(0,6-2+1)=5, high = min(6,6)=6 -> count=2 -> 789*2=1578\n        i=7: low = max(0,7-2+1)=6, high = min(7,6)=6 -> count=1 -> 1*1=1\n\n        Now, sum = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n\n        Let's add step by step:\n          1+4=5\n          5+8=13\n          13+200000=200013\n          200013+246=200259\n          200259+912=201171\n          201171+1578=202749\n          202749+1=202750.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the high is min(i, n-k) but wait: the window must start at j such that j <= i and j <= n-k (so j_max is the minimum of i and n-k). \n\n   But note: the window j must satisfy j <= n-k (because j+k-1 <= n-1 => j <= n-k). So the condition is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if k is 1? Then the number of windows is n, and each element a[i] should appear in (n - i + ...) ?\n\n   Let me test with n=3, k=1: \n        total_weeks = 3\n        For i=0: low = max(0,0)=0, high = min(0,3-1)=min(0,2)=0 -> count=1\n        For i=1: low = max(0,1-1+1)=max(0,1)=1, high = min(1,2)=1 -> count=1\n        For i=2: low = max(0,2-1+1)=2, high = min(2,2)=2 -> count=1\n        total_window_sum = a0+a1+a2, then average = (a0+a1+a2)/3, which is the average per day? But wait, the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and a week is 1 day. So the average per week is the average per day.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and a week is k consecutive days. When k=1, then each week is one day, so the average per week is the average of the daily values.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, in the example with k=1, the average is (a0+a1+a2)/3, which is the same as the average of the entire array.\n\n   However, note: the problem considers each contiguous k-day period as a week. So for k=1, there are n weeks (each day is a week). Then the average is the average of the n days.\n\n   But the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and each week is just one day. So yes, we are averaging the daily values.\n\n   So the above method is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem states that the average is the average of the weekly sleep times. And the weekly sleep time is the sum of the k consecutive days.\n\n   We are calculating: (sum_{week} (sum of k days)) / (n-k+1)\n\n   And we can break the numerator by linearity: for each day, the value a[i] is multiplied by the number of weeks that contain that day.\n\n   Therefore, the program:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0.0   # we'll use float for division\n\n        # Precompute the count for each index i: number of windows that include i.\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate and compute the count for each i.\n\n        # We'll do:\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        #       high_bound = min(i, n - k)\n        #       if low_bound <= high_bound:\n        #           count = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n        #       else:\n        #           count = 0\n        #       total_sum += a[i] * count\n\n        # But note: the condition for the window is that the window must start at j such that j<=i and j>=i-k+1 and j<=n-k (so j<=min(i, n-k)).\n        # The above condition for high_bound uses min(i, n-k). However, note that if i < n-k, then high_bound=i, else n-k.\n\n        # But wait, what if i > n-k? Then the window must start at j from i-k+1 to n-k (which is fixed). So the condition is still: j_min = max(0, i-k+1), j_max = min(i, n-k) -> but if i > n-k, then j_max = n-k (because n-k < i). So the condition is correct.\n\n        # However, note: the window must start at j<=n-k, and j<=i, so j_max is the minimum of i and n-k.\n\n        # But wait, is that always true? Yes.\n\n        # But we must ensure that j_min <= j_max. Otherwise, we set count=0.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can write without if:\n\n        #   j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        #   j_max = min(i, n - k)\n        #   count = max(0, j_max - j_min + 1)\n\n        # However, note: the condition for the window to exist is that j_min <= j_max, so we can compute count = max(0, j_max - j_min + 1)\n\n        # Let's code accordingly.\n\n        # But note: the above condition for j_min and j_max is standard.\n\n        total_sum = 0.0\n        for i in range(n):\n            j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            j_max = min(i, n - k)\n            if j_min > j_max:\n                count = 0\n            else:\n                count = j_max - j_min + 1\n            total_sum += a[i] * count\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the output to have at least 6 decimal places, but the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n        # We can use formatting to output with 10 decimal places.\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, note: the example with n=1, k=1: \n        total_weeks = 1\n        i=0: j_min = max(0,0-1+1)=0, j_max = min(0,0)=0 -> count=1\n        total_sum = a[0]*1\n        average = a[0]/1 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what if k is greater than n? According to the input constraint, k<=n, so no.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> average=9.0 -> output \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> 10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n   Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> 202750/7 ≈ 28964.2857142857 -> \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   However, note: the example output is given as '28964.2857142857', which has 10 decimal places.\n\n   But wait, 202750/7 is 28964.2857142857142857... so we can format to 10 decimal places.\n\n   But note: we are using floating point. The numbers are integers and the division is exact for base 10 representation? Not necessarily, but the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   Since n and k are up to 200000, and a[i] up to 100000, the maximum total_sum is about 200000 * 100000 * (at most k) but wait: the count for an element is at most k (actually, the count for an element is at most k, because the window length is k, so an element can be in at most k consecutive windows). \n\n   Actually, the maximum count for an element is k (for the middle elements). So total_sum <= 200000 * 100000 * k, which is 200000 * 100000 * 200000 -> too big for integer? But we are using integers and then converting to float? \n\n   However, the problem constraints: n,k up to 200000, and a[i] up to 100000.\n\n   The maximum total_sum is the sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (count_i) and each a[i] <= 100000, and each count_i <= k (<=200000). So maximum total_sum <= 100000 * 200000 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision, but we are doing integer arithmetic until we divide by total_weeks which is integer).\n\n   However, we are using integer arithmetic and then converting to float for division? But 4e15 is a large integer, but when we divide by total_weeks (which is at most 200000) we get a float.\n\n   But note: we are allowed an absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Using floating point might lose precision for very large numbers, but note: the numbers are integers and the total_sum is an integer, and total_weeks is an integer. The division is exact in decimal if the total_weeks divides total_sum, but in general we are using floating point.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   But if we use integer division and then convert to float, we might lose precision. However, the problem says the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   But note: the total_sum is an integer and total_weeks is an integer, so we can do:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks   # in Python, this will be a float even if we use integers.\n\n   However, the numbers are big, but the floating point has enough precision for numbers up to around 1e15? Let me check: double precision floating point can represent integers exactly up to 2^53 ~ 9e15. Our total_sum is up to 4e15, so it's below 9e15, so the integer part is exact.\n\n   But then the fractional part? We are only required to 1e-6, so 10 decimal places is safe.\n\n   However, we can also use decimal or fractions, but the problem doesn't require that. The above method is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: is the above method efficient? We are iterating once over n (which is 200000) and each iteration is O(1). So overall O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, there is an alternative method: using a sliding window to compute the total_window_sum.\n\n   We can compute the total_window_sum by:\n\n        total_window_sum = 0\n        window_sum = 0\n        # First, build the initial window [0:k]\n        for i in range(k):\n            window_sum += a[i]\n\n        # Then, we can compute the contribution of the next windows by shifting the window one by one.\n\n        # But note: we want the sum of all window sums.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the same idea as the sliding window but to accumulate the total.\n\n        # However, we already have the direct method.\n\n   Let's stick to the direct method.\n\n   But wait: the direct method uses two min and max operations per element, and then a multiplication and addition. This is O(n) and efficient.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints are up to 200000, so we can do 200000 iterations.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   But wait, there's a catch: the condition for j_max = min(i, n-k) and j_min = max(0, i-k+1) is correct? \n\n   Let me re-derive the count for an element a[i]:\n\n        The window must start at j, and the window covers from j to j+k-1 (inclusive).\n\n        Conditions for a[i] to be included:\n            j <= i <= j+k-1\n        => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1\n\n        Also, j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive).\n\n        So j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n        j_max = min(i, n-k)   [because j cannot exceed i (since the window must cover i and the window starts at j and goes to j+k-1, and i>=j) and j cannot exceed n-k (so that the window fits)]\n\n        Then the count is the number of integers j from j_min to j_max inclusive, which is j_max - j_min + 1, provided that j_min <= j_max.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, we can also use:\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # The leftmost window that includes a[i] starts at j0 = max(0, i-k+1)\n            # The rightmost window that includes a[i] starts at j1 = min(i, n-k) [but wait, the window must end at j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-k, and j<=i (because the window must cover i and the window starts at j and goes to j+k-1, and i>=j)].\n\n            # But note: the condition j<=i is automatically satisfied because we are taking j_max = min(i, n-k). \n\n            # However, wait: is it necessary that j<=i? Yes, because the window starts at j and must include i, so j<=i.\n\n            # So the above is correct.\n\n   But note: the above condition for j_max: we are limiting by i and n-k. \n\n   Another way to think: the window must start at j such that j<=i and j>=i-k+1 and j<=n-k. So the upper bound is the minimum of i and n-k, and the lower bound is the maximum of 0 and i-k+1.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, let me test with a different example: n=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n\n        total_weeks = 3\n\n        Windows: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]\n\n        total_window_sum = (1+2+3) + (2+3+4) + (3+4+5) = 6 + 9 + 12 = 27\n\n        Now, by our method:\n\n        i=0: j_min = max(0,0-3+1)=0, j_max = min(0,5-3)=min(0,2)=0 -> count=1 -> 1\n        i=1: j_min = max(0,1-3+1)=0, j_max = min(1,2)=1 -> count=2 -> 2*2=4\n        i=2: j_min = max(0,2-3+1)=0, j_max = min(2,2)=2 -> count=3 -> 3*3=9\n        i=3: j_min = max(0,3-3+1)=1, j_max = min(3,2)=2 -> count=2 -> 4*2=8\n        i=4: j_min = max(0,4-3+1)=2, j_max = min(4,2)=2 -> count=1 -> 5*1=5\n\n        total_sum = 1+4+9+8+5 = 27 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            j_max = min(i, n - k)   # because j must be <= n-k (so the window ends at j+k-1 <= n-1) and j<=i (so the window includes i)\n            if j_min <= j_max:\n                count = j_max - j_min + 1\n                total_sum += a[i] * count\n            else:\n                # This element is not included in any window? But according to the problem, we have windows from 0 to n-k, and the condition for an element to be included is j_min <= j_max.\n                # Actually, if j_min > j_max, then no window includes this element.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given period. Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all these weeks and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time per week, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to compute this efficiently without recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each week individually, we recognize that each day's sleep time contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position `i` in the array will be included in all windows (weeks) that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The number of such windows is `count = max(0, min(i, n - k) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each day, compute its contribution to the total sleep time by multiplying its sleep duration by the number of weeks it appears in. Summing these contributions gives the total sleep time across all weeks. The average is then this total divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        j_max = min(i, n - k)\n        count = j_max - j_min + 1\n        total_sum += a[i] * count\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week). The subsequent values are the sleep durations for each day.\n2. **Total Weeks Calculation**: The total number of weeks is `n - k + 1`, derived from the fact that each week starts at any day from 1 to `n - k + 1`.\n3. **Summing Contributions**: For each day `i`, the number of weeks it appears in is determined by the overlapping windows. This is calculated as `j_max - j_min + 1`, where `j_min` is the earliest starting day of a window that includes day `i`, and `j_max` is the latest such starting day.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sleep time across all weeks is summed up, and the average is computed by dividing this sum by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
