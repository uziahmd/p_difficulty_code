Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. We need to check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight line segments connecting each spaceship to its base do not intersect.\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can use a brute-force approach. However, note that we must assign each spaceship to exactly one base and vice versa, so we are looking for a perfect matching (if R != B, then it's impossible). But wait: the problem states \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" with every base having one guardian and each spaceship having one base. So we require R == B? Actually, the input says \"For 1 ≤ i ≤ R\" for spaceships and then B lines for bases. The problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning that the total number of spaceships must equal the total number of bases. So first, we can check if R != B -> then output 'No'.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n   First line: \"3 3\"\n   Then 3 lines for spaceships, then 3 lines for bases.\n\n However, the second example input: \n   \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n Here R=2, B=1, so we cannot have a perfect matching. So we output 'No'.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n 3. Read the next R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n Now, we have two sets of points: S (spaceships) and Bases (B bases).\n\n We are to assign each spaceship to a base (a bijection) such that the line segments (from each spaceship to its assigned base) do not intersect.\n\n Note: The problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\". \n\n Important: The condition is about non-intersecting in the plane. However, note that the entire set of points (spaceships and bases) are distinct and no three are colinear.\n\n How to check for non-intersecting segments?\n  In general, two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if the endpoints of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment. However, here we have multiple segments and we require that no two segments (from different pairs) intersect.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire drawing is planar, but that the assignment has the property that the set of segments drawn (which form a matching) do not cross.\n\n However, note that the matching is a set of edges between two sets (bipartite graph) and we require that the edges do not cross.\n\n How to check for a given matching? We can check all pairs of edges: for each pair of edges (i, j) and (k, l) (with i,k being from the spaceship side and j,l from the base side) the segments (ship_i, base_j) and (ship_k, base_l) should not intersect.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which base is assigned to which ship. We have to consider all permutations (if R=B=10, then 10! is about 3.6 million, and then checking each permutation by comparing every pair of edges (which would be O(R^2) per permutation) would lead to 3.6e6 * 100 = 360e6 comparisons, which is acceptable in Pyton? But worst-case 10! is 3628800, and for each we check C(10,2)*C(2,2) but actually we are checking for crossing between any two edges. Actually, we have to check for every pair of edges in the matching. The matching has R edges (and R<=10). The number of pairs of edges is C(R,2) = 45. For each edge pair, we check if they intersect.\n\n However, note: the matching is a set of edges, and we have to check that no two edges cross. But note: the entire set of edges might also include the possibility of two edges sharing an endpoint (they meet at an endpoint) which is allowed (the problem says \"paths\" and typically we consider that endpoints are distinct and the intersection at endpoints is allowed). So we only care about intersections that are not at the endpoints.\n\n How to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect (properly, i.e., not at endpoints)? We can use the following:\n\n  Two segments (A,B) and (C,D) intersect if and only if the following conditions hold:\n    - The orientations of the triplet (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and\n    - The orientations of the triplet (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different.\n\n But note: the segments are from a set of points. Alternatively, we can use the standard method: check if point C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of the line CD.\n\n However, we must be cautious because the endpoints are shared. We don't want to consider an intersection at an endpoint.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. It doesn't explicitly say excluding endpoints, but in typical geometric matching problems, endpoints are considered as meeting points and not as intersections. Therefore, we only care about proper crossings (in the interior of the edges).\n\n So we can define a function `segments_intersect(a, b, c, d)` that returns True if the segments ab and cd intersect at a point that is not an endpoint of either segment.\n\n Steps for the function:\n  Let the four points be A, B, C, D.\n\n  We can use the cross product method:\n\n  Define a function for orientation of three points p, q, r:\n      val = (qy - py) * (rx - qx) - (qx - px) * (ry - qy)\n      If val > 0: counterclockwise\n      If val < 0: clockwise\n      If val == 0: collinear\n\n  Then, two segments AB and CD intersect (properly) if:\n      (A->C and A->D have opposite orientations) and (B->C and B->D have opposite orientations)\n\n  However, we must exclude the case where the intersection is at an endpoint. But note: if the segments share an endpoint, then we don't want to consider that as an intersection. So we must check that the endpoints are not the same as the endpoints of the other segment.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check for proper intersection without endpoints by ensuring that the endpoints of one segment are strictly on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\n  Standard method (from computational geometry):\n\n  To check if segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect (without endpoints):\n\n  def ccw(A, B, C):\n      return (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\n  Then, segments (A,B) and (C,D) intersect if:\n      ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0 and ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0\n\n  However, note: this condition does not account for collinear points, but the problem states \"no three points are on the same line\", so we don't have to worry about collinearity.\n\n  But wait: what if the segments are adjacent (share an endpoint)? Then one of the endpoints will be used in both segments. However, note that our matching uses distinct points (each base and each spaceship is used once). So the two segments we are checking are between two different pairs. Therefore, the four endpoints are distinct? Actually, no: the two segments we are checking are from the matching, and the matching is a set of edges. The edges are disjoint (each vertex is in one edge). Therefore, the two segments we are checking do not share any endpoints. Because the matching is a set of edges that cover all vertices without repetition.\n\n  Wait, is that true? Actually, no: the matching is a set of edges that form a matching (each vertex appears in exactly one edge). Therefore, the two edges we are checking (from the matching) are disjoint: they don't share any vertex. Therefore, the four endpoints are distinct.\n\n  So we can safely use the condition:\n\n      ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0 and ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0\n\n  But note: the above condition is necessary and sufficient for two segments to properly cross (without sharing endpoints) when the four points are distinct and no three are collinear.\n\n However, let me test with a simple example: two segments that cross at their midpoints.\n\n Example: \n   Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n   Segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n   ccw((0,0), (2,2), (0,2)) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*2 - 2*2 = 0? Wait, no: wait the ccw formula is:\n\n      ccw(A, B, C) = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\n   Let A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(0,2):\n      = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4.\n\n   Then ccw(A, B, D) for D=(2,0):\n      = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 0 - 2*2 = -4.\n\n   Then the product: 4 * (-4) = -16 < 0.\n\n   Now, the other part: ccw(C, D, A) and ccw(C, D, B):\n      C=(0,2), D=(2,0), A=(0,0):\n          = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) = 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4.\n      C=(0,2), D=(2,0), B=(2,2):\n          = (2-0)*(2-2) - (0-2)*(2-0) = 0 - (-2)*2 = 4.\n\n      Product: (-4)*4 = -16 < 0.\n\n   So the condition holds.\n\n  Another example: two segments that do not cross.\n\n   Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n   Segment2: (0,1) to (1,0)\n\n   This is the same as above, but with the same shape? Actually, it's the same example.\n\n  Wait, let me take two segments that are disjoint and not crossing.\n\n   Segment1: (0,0) to (0,1) [vertical]\n   Segment2: (1,0) to (1,1) [another vertical]\n\n   Then, check with A=(0,0), B=(0,1), C=(1,0), D=(1,1)\n\n   ccw(A, B, C) = (0-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 1*1 = -1\n   ccw(A, B, D) = (0-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 1*1 = -1\n   Product: (-1)*(-1)=1 >=0 -> condition fails.\n\n  So that works.\n\n  Therefore, we can write a helper function for checking two segments (given by two pairs of points) for proper intersection.\n\n  However, note: we are going to check every pair of edges in a matching. And the matching is a set of edges (each edge is from a spaceship to a base). We have to check that for the entire matching, no two edges cross.\n\n  Steps for the overall solution:\n\n  1. Check if R != B: then output 'No'\n  2. If R == B, then generate all permutations of the bases (or equivalently, we can consider the assignment as a bijection from spaceships to bases). But note: we have two sets, so we can assign the i-th spaceship to the j-th base. We can represent the matching as a permutation: for example, assign spaceship i to base[perm[i]].\n\n  3. For each permutation (which represents an assignment from the list of spaceships to the list of bases), check that for every pair of edges (i, base_perm[i]) and (j, base_perm[j]) (with i < j) the two segments do not intersect (using the ccw method above).\n\n  4. If we find at least one permutation for which no two edges cross, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, after checking all, output 'No'.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning that we require the entire set of segments to be non-intersecting. So we must check that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require that the entire set of edges forms a planar graph? Actually, the condition is that the two paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship and from another base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. So we require that the entire set of edges (the matching) has no crossing edges.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  Let:\n      spaceships = list of R points (each point is (x, y))\n      bases = list of B points (each point is (x, y))\n\n  We'll write:\n\n      def ccw(A, B, C):\n          return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n      def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n          # a, b, c, d are tuples (x,y)\n          o1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n          o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n          o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n          o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n          # Check if the orientations are different for both\n          if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:\n              return True\n          else:\n              return False\n\n  But wait: the above function returns True if they intersect (properly). However, note that the two segments might not intersect even if the orientations are mixed? Actually, the condition is necessary and sufficient for two segments to intersect (when the four points are distinct and no three collinear). \n\n  Then, for a given matching (a list of edges: each edge is (ship_i, base_perm[i])), we check every pair of edges (i, j) (with i < j) and see if the two segments (edge_i and edge_j) intersect.\n\n  However, note: the matching is a set of edges that are disjoint (each vertex is used once). Therefore, the four points (ship_i, base_perm[i], ship_j, base_perm[j]) are distinct.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      from itertools import permutations\n\n      if R != B:\n          print(\"No\")\n      else:\n          ships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n          bases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\n          # Generate all bijections (permutations of bases for the ships)\n          found = False\n          for perm in permutations(range(B)):\n              # Create the matching: for ship index i, assign base index perm[i]\n              # The matching edges: [(ships[0], bases[perm[0]]), (ships[1], bases[perm[1]]), ...]\n              edges = []\n              for i in range(R):\n                  edges.append( (ships[i], bases[perm[i]]) )\n\n              # Check that no two edges in the matching cross\n              valid = True\n              n_edges = len(edges)\n              # We'll check every pair of edges\n              for i in range(n_edges):\n                  for j in range(i+1, n_edges):\n                      seg1 = (edges[i][0], edges[i][1])\n                      seg2 = (edges[j][0], edges[j][1])\n                      # But note: our segments_intersect expects four points: a, b, c, d.\n                      # Let the first segment be from edges[i][0] to edges[i][1], and the second from edges[j][0] to edges[j][1].\n                      a, b = edges[i]\n                      c, d = edges[j]\n                      if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  if not valid:\n                      break\n\n              if valid:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n          if found:\n              print(\"Yes\")\n          else:\n              print(\"No\")\n\n  However, note: the order of the points in the segment_intersect function: the function expects four points: the first two define the first segment, the last two the second.\n\n  But wait: our segments_intersect function uses:\n\n      o1 = ccw(a, b, c)   # a, b, c: points a, b, c\n      o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n      o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n      o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, note: the matching edges are defined from a spaceship to a base. The order (a to b) is fixed: the first element is the spaceship and the second is the base. But the function does not depend on the direction of the segment (because the ccw function is antisymmetric and the product condition remains the same).\n\n  But wait: what if we reverse the order of one segment? Let's test:\n\n      Original: (A, B) and (C, D): \n          Condition: ccw(A,B,C)*ccw(A,B,D) < 0 and ccw(C,D,A)*ccw(C,D,B) < 0.\n\n      If we reverse the second segment to (D, C): \n          Condition becomes: ccw(A,B,D)*ccw(A,B,C) < 0 and ccw(D,C,A)*ccw(D,C,B) < 0.\n\n      But note: ccw(C,D,A) = -ccw(D,C,A) and similarly for the others. However, the product condition: \n          The first part: ccw(A,B,C)*ccw(A,B,D) < 0 is the same as ccw(A,B,D)*ccw(A,B,C) < 0 (since multiplication is commutative).\n          The second part: ccw(C,D,A)*ccw(C,D,B) < 0 is the same as (-ccw(D,C,A)) * (-ccw(D,C,B)) = ccw(D,C,A)*ccw(D,C,B) < 0? Actually, no: \n          Let me compute: \n            ccw(C,D,A) = (D.x-C.x)*(A.y-C.y) - (D.y-C.y)*(A.x-C.x)\n            ccw(D,C,A) = (C.x-D.x)*(A.y-D.y) - (C.y-D.y)*(A.x-D.x)\n          These are not negatives of each other. Actually, note that the cross product for (C,D,A) is the negative of (D,C,A) multiplied by the determinant of the transformation? \n\n      Actually, the cross product for (C,D,A) is:\n          (D.x-C.x)*(A.y-C.y) - (D.y-C.y)*(A.x-C.x)\n\n      and for (D,C,A) is:\n          (C.x-D.x)*(A.y-D.y) - (C.y-D.y)*(A.x-D.x)\n\n      They are not negatives. However, we can note that the condition for the second segment is independent of the order? Actually, the condition for the second segment requires that the two endpoints (A and B) are on opposite sides of the line CD. But if we reverse the segment, the line is the same. The function ccw(C,D,A) and ccw(D,C,A) are related, but note the condition is:\n\n          ccw(C,D,A)*ccw(C,D,B) < 0\n\n      If we reverse the segment to (D,C) then the condition becomes:\n\n          ccw(D,C,A)*ccw(D,C,B) < 0\n\n      But note: \n          ccw(D,C,A) = (C.x-D.x)*(A.y-D.y) - (C.y-D.y)*(A.x-D.x)\n          = (-(D.x-C.x))*(A.y-D.y) - (-(D.y-C.y))*(A.x-D.x)\n          = -[(D.x-C.x)*(A.y-D.y) - (D.y-C.y)*(A.x-D.x)]\n\n      And note: the line CD is the same as DC. The condition for the two points A and B being on opposite sides of the line CD is equivalent to the condition for the two points A and B being on opposite sides of the line DC? Yes, because the line is the same. However, the sign of the cross product depends on the direction.\n\n      Actually, the condition for the two points A and B to be on opposite sides of the line CD is:\n\n          ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0\n\n      Similarly, for the line DC (which is the same line) the condition is:\n\n          ccw(D, C, A) * ccw(D, C, B) < 0\n\n      But note: the cross product for the line CD is defined with the direction from C to D, and for DC from D to C. The condition for opposite sides is the same: the product must be negative.\n\n      However, observe:\n\n          ccw(C, D, A) = (dx1 = D.x-C.x, dy1 = D.y-C.y; then (dx1)*(Ay-Cy) - (dy1)*(Ax-Cx)\n          ccw(D, C, A) = (dx2 = C.x-D.x, dy2 = C.y-D.y; then (dx2)*(Ay-Dy) - (dy2)*(Ax-Dx)\n\n      But note: dx2 = -dx1, dy2 = -dy1, and Ay-Dy = -(Dy-Ay) and Ax-Dx = -(Dx-Ax) -> wait, no:\n\n          Actually, the points are fixed. Let me write:\n\n          ccw(C, D, A) = (D.x-C.x)*(A.y-C.y) - (D.y-C.y)*(A.x-C.x)\n\n          ccw(D, C, A) = (C.x-D.x)*(A.y-D.y) - (C.y-D.y)*(A.x-D.x)\n\n          = (- (D.x-C.x)) * (A.y-D.y) - (- (D.y-C.y)) * (A.x-D.x)\n\n          = - (D.x-C.x)*(A.y-D.y) + (D.y-C.y)*(A.x-D.x)\n\n          Now, note: A.y-D.y = (A.y-C.y) - (D.y-C.y) and similarly for x. But this is messy.\n\n      Alternatively, note that the condition for two points A and B to be separated by the line CD is independent of the direction of the line. However, the product condition is the same because:\n\n          Let f(line, P) = sign of the cross product of (line direction) and (P - one endpoint).\n\n          The condition is that the two points A and B yield opposite signs.\n\n      But observe: if we reverse the line, the entire cross product (for the same vector from the line's starting point to P) is negated? Actually, the cross product for the reversed line would be:\n\n          For the line from D to C: the direction vector is (C-D). Then the cross product for A is (C-D) x (A-D) [if we use D as the base] or (C-D) x (A-C)? \n\n      Actually, the standard way to check for two points A and B being on opposite sides of the line CD is:\n\n          ( (B - C) x (D - C) ) * ( (A - C) x (D - C) ) < 0   [using the vector form]\n\n      But wait, the standard method I used earlier (with four ccw) is the same as:\n\n          ( (B-C)x(D-C) and (A-C)x(D-C) ) have opposite signs.\n\n      And if we use the line from D to C, then we can write:\n\n          ( (B-D)x(C-D) ) * ( (A-D)x(C-D) ) < 0\n\n      But note: (B-D)x(C-D) = (B-C + (C-D)) x (C-D) = ... and it's messy.\n\n  Let me stick to the original condition: we use the four-point method and the segments_intersect function as defined.\n\n  However, note: in our matching, the edges are defined from a spaceship to a base. The order is fixed: the first point is the spaceship and the second is the base. But the function segments_intersect does not depend on the order of the segment? Actually, the condition is symmetric for the two segments, but the order of the points in a segment matters for the ccw calculation.\n\n  But note: the condition for the first segment (A,B) requires that C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB. The condition for the second segment (C,D) requires that A and B are on opposite sides of the line CD.\n\n  Therefore, the order of the two segments is arbitrary. But we must pass the four points in the correct order: the first two for the first segment, the last two for the second.\n\n  However, note: the function segments_intersect(a, b, c, d) uses:\n\n      o1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n      o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n      o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n      o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  One more thing: the problem says the points are integers. We are using integer arithmetic, so no floating point issues.\n\n  But note: the problem says |xi|, |yi| <= 10000, and R, B <= 10. So the numbers are small.\n\n  Let me test with the example: \n      Input: \n          3 3\n          0 0\n          2 0\n          3 1\n          -2 1\n          0 3\n          2 2\n\n      We need to check if there exists a matching.\n\n      One matching: assign the first spaceship (0,0) to the first base (-2,1), the second spaceship (2,0) to the second base (0,3), and the third spaceship (3,1) to the third base (2,2).\n\n      Check the three segments: \n        s1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n        s2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n        s3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n      Check s1 and s2: \n        (0,0) to (-2,1) and (2,0) to (0,3)\n\n        Plotting: \n          s1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): goes left and up.\n          s2: from (2,0) to (0,3): goes left and up.\n\n        Do they intersect?\n\n        We can compute:\n\n          s1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n          s2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\n        Using the condition:\n\n          ccw((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) = ( (-2-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) ) = (-2*0 - 1*2) = -2\n          ccw((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)) = ( (-2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) ) = (-2*3 - 1*0) = -6\n          Product: (-2)*(-6) = 12 > 0 -> so the first condition fails (we require <0).\n\n        Then the segments do not intersect by the first condition? But wait, the condition requires both products to be negative. The first product is positive, so they don't intersect.\n\n        Now, check the other way: ccw for the second segment with the first segment's endpoints:\n\n          ccw((2,0), (0,3), (0,0)) = ( (0-2)*(0-0) - (3-0)*(0-2) ) = ( -2*0 - 3*(-2) ) = 0 + 6 = 6\n          ccw((2,0), (0,3), (-2,1)) = ( (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) ) = (-2*1 - 3*(-4)) = -2 + 12 = 10\n          Product: 6*10 = 60 > 0 -> condition fails.\n\n        So the two segments do not intersect.\n\n        Now, check s1 and s3: (0,0)->(-2,1) and (3,1)->(2,2)\n\n        Condition for s1 and s3:\n\n          ccw((0,0), (-2,1), (3,1)) = (-2-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) = (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2-3 = -5\n          ccw((0,0), (-2,1), (2,2)) = (-2-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4-2 = -6\n          Product: (-5)*(-6)=30 > 0 -> condition fails.\n\n        Condition for s3 and s1 (the other way):\n\n          ccw((3,1), (2,2), (0,0)) = (2-3)*(0-1) - (2-1)*(0-3) = (-1)*(-1) - (1)*(-3) = 1 + 3 = 4\n          ccw((3,1), (2,2), (-2,1)) = (2-3)*(1-1) - (2-1)*(-2-3) = (-1)*0 - (1)*(-5) = 5\n          Product: 4*5=20>0 -> condition fails.\n\n        Now, check s2 and s3: (2,0)->(0,3) and (3,1)->(2,2)\n\n        Condition for s2 and s3:\n\n          ccw((2,0), (0,3), (3,1)) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) = (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2-3=-5\n          ccw((2,0), (0,3), (2,2)) = (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) = (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4\n          Product: (-5)*(-4)=20>0 -> condition fails.\n\n        So the entire matching is valid.\n\n        However, note: we must check all pairs, and we did.\n\n        But wait: the example output is 'Yes'. So this matching is one of the ones that works.\n\n        But how do we know that there is at least one matching? We are iterating over all permutations until we find one.\n\n        There are 3! = 6 permutations. We found one that works.\n\n        Therefore, we output 'Yes'.\n\n  However, note: the example input was given as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n  The second example: \n        Input: 2 1\n               1 0\n               2 2\n               3 1\n\n        Here R=2, B=1 -> so we output 'No'\n\n  But wait, the example output is ['Yes', 'No'].\n\n  So the code must output 'No' for the second example.\n\n  However, note: the second example input has two spaceships and one base. Therefore, R != B -> we output 'No'. Correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code below implements the above.\n\n  But note: efficiency. The worst-case R=B=10, then we have 10! = 3628800 permutations. For each permutation, we check C(10,2)=45 pairs of edges. Each pair requires 4 ccw calculations (each ccw does 2 multiplications and 2 subtractions, then one multiplication). So total operations per permutation: 45 * 4 * (some constant) ~ 180 operations (each operation is cheap). Then total operations: 3628800 * 180 ~ 653 million operations. In Python, this might be borderline, but note that 653 million operations is acceptable in many cases (especially in competitive programming with fast machines and compiled code, but in pure Python it might take a few minutes).\n\n  However, 10! is 3.6e6, and 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6 checks (each check is 4 ccw). Each ccw is a few arithmetic operations. On a typical machine, 162e6 * (say 10 operations) is 1.62e9 operations, which in Python might take several seconds (maybe 10-20 seconds) but still acceptable for the constraints (R, B up to 10).\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"easy\", and the constraints are small (R, B from 1 to 10). However, worst-case 10 is the maximum and 10! is 3.6e6, so we must hope that the actual matching is found early. But worst-case we have to check all.\n\n  Alternatively, we could try to use a smarter method (like using a planarity testing for bipartite graphs with straight-line embedding) but that is more complex.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"no three points are colinear\", and the graph is a matching (so the edges are disjoint). So the entire set of edges is a set of non-overlapping edges.\n\n  Another idea: we can try to use a recursive backtracking and prune when a partial matching already has crossing edges. But the problem is small enough (10) and 10! is acceptable.\n\n  However, let me check: 10! is 3628800, which is acceptable in C++/Java but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n  But note: the constraints say that R and B are at most 10. The worst-case is 10, and 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we code efficiently.\n\n  Let me run a quick test: generating 3.6e6 permutations and for each doing 45 * 4 = 180 ccw calculations (each ccw is 4 arithmetic operations: two subtractions and two multiplications, then one subtraction). So 3.6e6 * 180 * (about 4 operations) is about 2.592e9 operations. On a modern CPU, 1e9 operations might take about 1 second in C, but in Python, each operation is interpreted and more expensive. However, we are using integers and the operations are relatively simple.\n\n  But note: the input size is small (only 10 points) so the coordinates are fixed. The main loop is the permutation and the double loop for the edges.\n\n  We can try to optimize by breaking early when an intersection is found.\n\n  Also, we can precompute the list of edges for a given permutation? Actually, we are building the edges list for each permutation. We can avoid building the entire list and break early.\n\n  Revised for efficiency:\n\n      We can represent the matching as a tuple of base indices (the permutation). Then, for the current matching (a tuple `perm` of length R), we can iterate over the edges (i from 0 to R-1) and for each edge i, we compare with all edges j>i.\n\n      We can precompute the list of edges as a list of (ship, base) but we don't need to store them all if we break early.\n\n      However, we are already breaking early when we find an intersection.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  Code structure:\n\n      import itertools\n\n      def main():\n          data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n          if not data:\n              print(\"No\")\n              return\n\n          # Parse the first two integers: R and B\n          it = iter(data)\n          R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n          if R != B:\n              print(\"No\")\n              return\n\n          ships = []\n          for i in range(R):\n              x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n             ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between spaceships and bases to find a valid matching where no two segments cross.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (bijection) between two sets of points (spaceships and bases) such that the line segments connecting each point from the first set to its corresponding point in the second set do not intersect. The key observation is that the segments must not cross, which can be verified using computational geometry principles.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For small input sizes (up to 10 points each), a brute-force approach is feasible. We generate all possible permutations of base assignments to spaceships and check each permutation to see if the corresponding segments intersect. If any permutation satisfies the non-intersection condition, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses:\n   - **Permutations**: To explore all possible assignments of bases to spaceships.\n   - **Cross Product Calculation**: To determine if two line segments intersect by checking the orientations of their endpoints relative to each other.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(R! * R^2), where R is the number of spaceships (and bases). For R=10, this results in approximately 3.6 million permutations, each requiring up to 45 segment intersection checks (for pairs of edges). Given the constraints, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it))\n    B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    ships = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n        \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n        o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n        o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n        o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n        if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                seg1 = (ships[i], bases[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (ships[j], bases[perm[j]])\n                a, b = seg1\n                c, d = seg2\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R and B are not equal, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Coordinate Reading**: The coordinates of spaceships and bases are stored in lists.\n3. **Cross Product Function (ccw)**: This helper function calculates the cross product of vectors formed by three points, used to determine the orientation (clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear).\n4. **Segment Intersection Check (segments_intersect)**: This function checks if two line segments intersect by verifying if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other.\n5. **Permutation Check**: All possible permutations of base assignments to spaceships are generated. For each permutation, the solution checks if any pair of segments intersects. If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, it outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, after checking all permutations, it outputs \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings using combinatorial permutations and geometric properties to ensure correctness.",
