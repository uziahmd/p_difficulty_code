    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element might change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` (after sorting). Then the overall instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n However, by removing one element, we can consider two cases:\n  1. Removing the current minimum: then the new min becomes the next smallest (if there are duplicates, we have to account for that).\n  2. Removing the current maximum: then the new max becomes the next largest.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can also consider removing an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum? \n However, note that if we remove an element that is not the global min or max, then the min and max remain the same (because the smallest and largest are still present). \n Therefore, the instability would remain the same (max-min) unless the removal of such an element changes the min or max? Actually, no: the min and max are the same set as before because the extreme values are still there.\n\n Therefore, the only candidates for removal that can change the instability are the removals of the minimum or the maximum (or possibly multiple minima/maxima but we only remove one).\n\n However, consider: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min? Then the new min becomes the next value. Similarly for max.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n  Option 1: Remove the global minimum -> then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the first occurrence of the next distinct value, but note: there might be multiple minima)\n  Option 2: Remove the global maximum -> then the new max is the next largest value.\n\n But note: the array may have duplicates. However, we don't necessarily need to remove the very first occurrence of the min or max. We can consider:\n\n  Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n  Then, if we remove an element at index i, the new array's min is:\n      If we remove an element that is the smallest, then the next smallest is sorted_a[1] (unless all elements are the same, then after removal we have n-1 copies of the same value -> instability 0).\n  Similarly, the new array's max is sorted_a[-2] (if we remove the last element) unless the last element was the only maximum.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. Therefore, the candidate removals are the ones that will change the min or the max. But actually, the problem is symmetric: we can consider the effect of removing each occurrence of the min and max.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  The overall instability without removal is M = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0].\n\n  After removal, the instability is max(remaining) - min(remaining).\n\n  Since we are only removing one element, the remaining array has all but one element.\n\n  The remaining array's min is:\n      either the original min (if we didn't remove the original min) OR the next smallest number (if we removed the original min and there is no duplicate min, then the next smallest is the next distinct number, but if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one min, the min remains the same until we remove all min occurrences? Actually, no: we only remove one element.\n\n  However, note: the min of the remaining array is the minimum between the original min (if we didn't remove the smallest) and the next smallest if we removed the smallest? Actually, the min of the remaining array is the smallest element in the array excluding the one we removed.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Let b_i be the array with the i-th element removed.\n\n  Then the instability of b_i is: max(b_i) - min(b_i)\n\n  But enumerating all i (n up to 10^5) is too expensive.\n\n  Instead, we can consider:\n\n  The answer is the minimum over i of (max(b_i) - min(b_i))\n\n  But note: the max(b_i) is either the global max (if the removed element isn't the max) or the second largest (if we remove the global max and it was the only occurrence) but wait, there might be multiple maxes.\n\n  Actually, let:\n      Let L = sorted(a)\n\n  Then, for any removal, the min of the remaining array is:\n      If we remove an element that is L[0], then the new min is the next distinct value? Not exactly: if there are multiple L[0] then even if we remove one, the min is still L[0] (because there's another copy). But if we remove the last occurrence of L[0] then the min becomes the next distinct value.\n\n  Similarly, for the max.\n\n  So we can consider:\n\n      candidate1: remove the first occurrence of the min -> then the new min is the next distinct value? Actually, no. We need to know how many times the min appears.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to remove one element. We don't have to remove the first occurrence. We can remove any occurrence. Therefore, the effect on the min is: if the min appears more than once, then even if we remove one min, the min remains the same. If the min appears exactly once, then the min becomes the next value (which is L[1]).\n\n  Similarly for the max.\n\n  Therefore, the instability after removal can be:\n\n      Option A: Remove an element that is not the min and not the max -> then the min and max remain the same, so instability is M.\n      Option B: Remove an element that is the min (but there are multiple min) -> then min remains the same, so instability is M (same as original) unless we remove the only min? Actually, if there are multiple min, then removing one min doesn't change the min. Similarly for max.\n\n  Therefore, the only removals that can improve the instability are those that remove the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max.\n\n  But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? Then we remove one element that is both the min and the max. Then the new min and max become the next distinct values (if they exist). However, note that the array must have at least two distinct numbers? Actually, no: if the array has all the same numbers, then removing one leaves n-1 copies, so min and max are the same -> instability 0.\n\n  So the idea:\n\n  Let M = L[-1] - L[0]\n\n  Now, consider:\n\n      Case 1: There exists an element that is the only min and we remove it -> then the new min is L[1] (if there are duplicates, we don't get improvement by removing one min). So we must check the frequency of the min and max.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider all possibilities:\n\n      Possibility 1: Remove an element that is not the min and not the max -> instability = M.\n\n      Possibility 2: Remove an element that is the min (and there is only one min) -> then the new min is L[1] and the max is L[-1] (unless the removed element was the only min and also the max? Then we have to consider that the max might change if we remove the last occurrence of the max? Actually, if the array has only two distinct values and we remove the min which is also the max (when all are same) then we already handled that. \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let L = sorted(a)\n\n      We consider two types of removals:\n\n        Type 1: Removal of the smallest element (if the smallest element is the only one, then the new min is L[1]; if there are multiple smallest, then the min remains L[0] and the instability is unchanged from M? Actually, no: the instability is max(L') - min(L') = L[-1] - L[0] (if we remove one min and there are duplicates, the min remains L[0] and the max remains L[-1]). So the instability remains M.\n\n        Similarly, removal of the largest element: if there is more than one max, then the max remains the same, so instability is M.\n\n      Therefore, the only removals that can improve the instability are:\n\n        - Removing the only occurrence of the min (so that the min increases to the next value) and then the instability becomes L[-1] - L[1] (if the min was unique).\n        - Removing the only occurrence of the max (so that the max decreases to the previous value) and then the instability becomes L[-2] - L[0] (if the max was unique).\n\n      Additionally, what if the array has only two distinct numbers? For example, [1,2,2,3]: \n          Original instability: 3-1=2.\n          Removing the 1: then array becomes [2,2,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n          Removing the 3: then array becomes [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n          Removing a 2: then array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n      But note: in this example, the min (1) is unique, so removal of 1 gives instability 3-2=1. The max (3) is unique, so removal of 3 gives instability 2-1=1.\n\n      Another example: [1,2,3,4] \n          Original instability: 4-1=3.\n          Removing 1: instability 4-2=2.\n          Removing 4: instability 3-1=2.\n          Removing 2: instability 4-1=3 (worse) -> but wait, why is that? Because the min and max are unchanged.\n\n      However, consider: [1,1,2,100] \n          Original instability: 100-1=99.\n          Removing one of the 1's: \n            If we remove the first 1: [1,2,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> instability 99.\n            If we remove the 2: [1,1,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> instability 99.\n            If we remove the 100: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n\n      So in this case, removing the 100 (the only max) reduces the instability to 1.\n\n      But note: the min (1) is not unique, so removing one 1 does not change the min (min remains 1) and the max remains 100. So the instability remains 99.\n\n  Therefore, the strategy:\n\n      We want to consider removals that change the min or the max.\n\n      Let:\n        candidate1 = L[-1] - L[1]   # This is the instability if we remove the only min (if the min is unique) OR if we remove a min that is duplicated, then the min remains the same and this candidate doesn't apply. But wait, we cannot use candidate1 if the min is duplicated? Actually, if the min is duplicated, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so we don't get this candidate.\n\n      Similarly, candidate2 = L[-2] - L[0]   # This is the instability if we remove the only max (if the max is unique) OR if the max is duplicated, then removing one max doesn't change the max.\n\n      However, note: what if we remove an element that is both the min and the max (like in [1,1,1,1,1])? Then the min and max are the same. Then the instability after removal is 0 (if we remove one and the rest are the same). But in that case, candidate1 and candidate2 would be:\n\n          candidate1: L[-1] - L[1] = 1 - 1 = 0\n          candidate2: L[-2] - L[0] = 1 - 1 = 0\n\n      But note: in [1,1,1,1,1], the min is not unique and the max is not unique. However, we can also consider:\n\n          candidate3: What if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the instability remains 0 (since all are same). But actually, the entire array is same, so removing one element leaves same values.\n\n      However, we are trying to minimize the instability. The best we can do is 0.\n\n      But wait, the above candidates (candidate1 and candidate2) are computed as if we are removing the min or the max. In the case of [1,1,1,1,1], the min is 1 and the max is 1. Then candidate1: 1-1=0, candidate2: 1-1=0.\n\n      Also, we must consider: sometimes the array has more than two distinct numbers, but the removal of a non-extreme element doesn't help.\n\n      Therefore, the answer is the minimum among:\n\n        candidate1: if the min is unique (i.e., the first element is less than the second) then candidate1 = L[-1]-L[1] is a candidate. Otherwise, we skip candidate1 (or rather, we don't consider candidate1 because removing the min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains M, which is worse than or equal to candidate1? Actually, if the min is duplicated, then candidate1 is not achievable by removing one min? Actually, we can remove one min and the min remains the same, so the instability is still M. But candidate1 is computed as if we removed the min and the min increased, which is only valid when the min is unique.\n\n      Similarly, candidate2: if the max is unique (i.e., the last element is greater than the second last) then candidate2 = L[-2]-L[0] is a candidate. Otherwise, we skip candidate2.\n\n      But wait: what if the array has multiple min and max? Then we have to consider that we might remove an element that is the min and the max (if the array has all the same)? Actually, the above condition for candidate1 and candidate2 naturally works because:\n\n        candidate1 = L[-1] - L[1] is valid only if the min is unique? Actually, no: if the min is duplicated, then the second element is also the min. So L[1] is the min. Then candidate1 = L[-1] - L[1] = M (the original instability) because L[0] == L[1]. Similarly, candidate2 = L[-2] - L[0] = M (if the max is duplicated, then L[-2] is the max, so L[-2]-L[0] = M).\n\n      Then, we must consider: what if we remove an element that is the min and the max (which happens when the entire array is the same)? Then the instability becomes 0. But note: in the case of all same, the above candidate1 and candidate2 are both M (because L[-1]-L[1] = same - same = 0? Wait, no: if the array is [1,1,1,1,1] then:\n          L = [1,1,1,1,1]\n          candidate1 = L[-1] - L[1] = 1-1 = 0.\n          candidate2 = L[-2] - L[0] = 1-1 = 0.\n\n      So we are getting 0 from both.\n\n      But also, we have the possibility that the removal of a non-min non-max element doesn't help. And the possibility that the removal of the min (even if duplicated) doesn't change the min, so the instability remains M, but we are also considering candidate1 and candidate2 which are computed from the sorted array.\n\n      However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. The best instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n          candidate1 (if the min is unique) OR candidate2 (if the max is unique) OR the original M (if we remove an element that is not the min or max, or if removing the min or max doesn't change the min or max respectively).\n\n      But wait, we can also consider: what if we remove an element that is the min (non-unique) then the instability is M (same as original) and similarly for the max. But we are trying to minimize the instability, so we don't want M if we can get lower.\n\n      However, note: the original instability is M. When we remove an element, the instability can only decrease or stay the same? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is M. But if we remove the min (if it is unique) then the min increases and the instability becomes M' = L[-1]-L[1] (which is <= M). Similarly, if we remove the max (if it is unique) then the instability becomes L[-2]-L[0] (<= M).\n\n      But note: what if we remove an element that is the min and also the max (in an array of same elements)? Then the instability becomes 0, which is less than M (unless M was 0).\n\n      Actually, our candidate1 and candidate2 are computed from the sorted array. But if the array has duplicates, then:\n\n        candidate1 = L[-1] - L[1]   (if we remove the min, then the new min is L[1] if the min was unique, but if the min is duplicated, then the new min is still L[0] and the instability is L[-1]-L[0] = M). However, we don't have to use candidate1 in the duplicated min case because we are only interested in the minimal instability.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n        Step 2: Sort the list a.\n        Step 3: Let M = a[-1] - a[0] (original instability)\n\n        Step 4: Consider candidate answers from:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[1]   if a[0] < a[1] else float('inf')\n          candidate_remove_max = a[-2] - a[0]     if a[-1] > a[-2] else float('inf')\n\n          candidate_remove_other = M   # because if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability remains M.\n\n        But wait, what if the array has only two elements? Then after removing one, the array has one element -> instability 0. However, our candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max would be:\n\n          Example [1,2]:\n            candidate_remove_min = 2 - 1 = 1? But wait, if we remove the 1 (min), then the array is [2] -> instability 0. Similarly, removing the 2 (max) gives [1] -> instability 0.\n\n          However, in our computation for candidate_remove_min: \n            a = [1,2] -> sorted is [1,2]\n            candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[1] = 2 - 2 -> wait, a[1] is 2. But then candidate_remove_min = 0. Similarly, candidate_remove_max = a[-2]-a[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n          But wait, in [1,2]:\n            Removing the min: the new min is a[1] (which is 2) and the max is 2, so instability 0.\n            Removing the max: the new max is a[-2] (which is 1) and the min is 1, so instability 0.\n\n          But note: our condition for candidate_remove_min: we used \"if a[0] < a[1]\" -> yes, 1<2 -> then candidate_remove_min = 2-2=0? That's correct.\n\n          However, what if we have [1,1,2]? \n            Original: [1,1,2] -> M=1.\n            candidate_remove_min: condition: a[0] < a[1] -> 1==1 -> false, so candidate_remove_min = inf.\n            candidate_remove_max: condition: a[-1] > a[-2] -> 2>1 -> true, so candidate_remove_max = a[-2]-a[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n          But wait, if we remove the max (the 2) then the array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n          Now, what if we have [1,2,2]?\n            Original: [1,2,2] -> M=1.\n            candidate_remove_min: condition: 1<2 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 2-2=0.\n            candidate_remove_max: condition: 2==2 -> false, candidate_remove_max = inf.\n\n          Then we take the minimum of {0, inf, 1} -> 0.\n\n          Now, what if we have [1,2,3]?\n            candidate_remove_min: condition: 1<2 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 3-2=1.\n            candidate_remove_max: condition: 3>2 -> true, candidate_remove_max = 2-1=1.\n            candidate_remove_other: M=2 (if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then we leave [1,2] or [1,3] or [2,3] -> the instabilities are 1,2,1 respectively, so the minimum from these is 1? But wait, our candidate_remove_other is defined as M (the original) which is 2, but we are also considering candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max.\n\n          However, note: in [1,2,3], if we remove the middle element (2) then the array is [1,3] -> instability 2. But that is worse than the other removals (which yield 1). So we don't need to consider candidate_remove_other separately because:\n\n          The candidate_remove_other (removing an element that is not the min or max) leads to an array that has the same min and max as the original? Not necessarily: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max of the remaining array are the same as the original, so the instability is M=2. But wait, in [1,2,3] if we remove the middle element (2) then the min is 1 and the max is 3 -> so the instability is 2, which is the same as the original. \n\n          However, note: the original instability is 2. Removing the middle element doesn't change the min and max, so the instability remains 2.\n\n          But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max, but the min and max are still the same? Then the instability is the same.\n\n          Therefore, the best we can do is the minimum of candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, and ... we don't need candidate_remove_other because if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability is M (the original) which is likely larger than the other two candidates (if they are finite). But note: in some cases, the removal of an element that is not the min or max might lead to a lower instability? \n\n          Let me think: \n            Example: [1,2,4] \n            Original instability M=3.\n            candidate_remove_min: condition: 1<2 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 4-2=2.\n            candidate_remove_max: condition: 4>2 -> true, candidate_remove_max = 2-1=1.\n            candidate_remove_other: removing the middle element (2) -> the array becomes [1,4] -> instability 3.\n\n          Then the minimum is 1 (from candidate_remove_max). \n\n          But note: in this example, the candidate_remove_other is 3, which is worse than 1 and 2.\n\n          Another example: [1,3,4] \n            Original: M=3.\n            candidate_remove_min: 1<3 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 4-3=1.\n            candidate_remove_max: 4>3 -> true, candidate_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n            candidate_remove_other: remove 3 -> [1,4] -> instability 3.\n\n          Then the minimum is 1.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to consider candidate_remove_other separately because:\n\n            candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max already consider the scenarios where we remove the min or the max (if they are unique) and that gives the best improvement.\n\n          However, wait: what if the array has more than two distinct numbers and the best removal is not the min or the max? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,100] \n            Original: M = 99.\n            candidate_remove_min: 1<2 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 100-2=98.\n            candidate_remove_max: 100>3 -> true, candidate_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n\n            Now, what if we remove an element that is not the min or max, say 2 or 3? \n              Removing 2: [1,3,100] -> instability 99.\n              Removing 3: [1,2,100] -> instability 99.\n\n            The best is candidate_remove_max (2). \n\n          So the above two candidates (removing min and max) are sufficient.\n\n          But wait: what if the array is [1,2,100,101]?\n            Original: M=100.\n            candidate_remove_min: 1<2 -> true, candidate_remove_min = 101-2=99.\n            candidate_remove_max: 101>100 -> true, candidate_remove_max = 100-1=99.\n\n            Now, what if we remove 2? Then the array [1,100,101] -> instability 100.\n            What if we remove 100? Then the array [1,2,101] -> instability 100.\n\n            But note: we can also remove an element that is not the min or max and get 100, which is worse than 99.\n\n          Therefore, we have:\n\n            ans = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n\n          However, wait: what if the array has two elements? Then:\n\n            [1,2]: candidate_remove_min = 2-2=0, candidate_remove_max=1-1=0 -> ans=0, which is correct.\n\n          But wait: in [1,2], the original instability is 1, and after removal we get 0.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to remove one element, so the resulting array has one element -> instability 0.\n\n          Now, what if the array has three elements and two are the same? [1,1,2] -> we computed candidate_remove_min as inf (because min is not unique) and candidate_remove_max as 0. Then ans=0.\n\n          However, note: candidate_remove_min was not considered because the min was duplicated. But wait, in [1,1,2]:\n\n            Removing one of the 1's: \n                Array becomes [1,2] -> instability 1 (because 2-1=1).\n                But wait, we computed candidate_remove_min as inf because we only consider candidate_remove_min if the min is unique. \n\n          Correction: We should consider that even if the min is duplicated, removing one min might not change the min, but then the instability is the same as the original (M). However, we are trying to find the minimum instability. In [1,1,2] the original instability is 1. But we can also remove the max (which is unique) to get 0.\n\n          Therefore, the above two candidates (candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max) are only defined when the min/max is unique. But what if we remove a min that is duplicated? Then the instability remains M. Similarly, for max.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. We don't have to remove the min or the max. But the best improvement comes from removing the min (if unique) or the max (if unique). Removing a non-unique min or max doesn't improve the instability (it stays M) and M is not better than the candidate_remove_min (if candidate_remove_min is defined) because candidate_remove_min = L[-1]-L[1] which is <= M (since L[1] >= L[0]). Similarly, candidate_remove_max = L[-2]-L[0] <= M.\n\n          But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max in a way that the min or max changes? Actually, no: the min is the smallest and if we remove an element that is not the min, the min remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n          Therefore, the only chance to improve the instability is to remove the min (if unique) or the max (if unique). Otherwise, the best we can do is M (by removing any other element, or by removing the min or max if they are duplicated).\n\n          However, note: sometimes even if the min is duplicated, removing one min might not change the min, but we can also remove the max (if unique) and get an improvement. \n\n          So the algorithm:\n\n            candidate1 = None\n            candidate2 = None\n\n            If the min is unique (a[0] < a[1]): candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n            Else: candidate1 is not defined (meaning we cannot get an improvement by removing the min, so we have to consider that the removal of the min leaves the instability as M)\n\n            Similarly, if the max is unique (a[-1] > a[-2]): candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n            Else: candidate2 is not defined.\n\n            Then, the answer is the minimum between:\n                candidate1 (if defined) and candidate2 (if defined) and M (if no candidate is defined, meaning we have to leave the instability as M).\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. Even if the min is duplicated, we can remove the max (if unique) and get candidate2, or remove the min (if duplicated) and get M, or remove the max (if duplicated) and get M.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is:\n\n                ans = min(\n                    (a[-1] - a[1]) if a[0] < a[1] else float('inf'),\n                    (a[-2] - a[0]) if a[-1] > a[-2] else float('inf'),\n                    a[-1] - a[0]   # This is M, the original, which is the result of removing an element that is not the min or max (or if we remove the min or max and they are duplicated, then the instability is M)\n                )\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min (duplicated) and the max (duplicated)? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is M.\n\n            However, note: we are only removing one element. We cannot remove both the min and the max at the same time.\n\n            Therefore, the above formula:\n\n                ans = min( candidate1, candidate2, M )\n\n            But note: candidate1 and candidate2 are defined only when the min or max is unique. And M is the original.\n\n            Let me test with [1,1,2] (min duplicated, max unique):\n\n                candidate1: 1<1 -> False -> inf\n                candidate2: 2>1 -> True -> 1-1=0\n                M = 2-1=1\n\n                Then ans = min(inf,0,1) = 0 -> correct.\n\n            Test with [1,2,2] (min unique, max duplicated):\n\n                candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> 2-2=0\n                candidate2: 2==2 -> False -> inf\n                M = 2-1=1\n\n                Then ans = min(0, inf, 1) = 0 -> correct.\n\n            Test with [1,2,3] (both unique):\n\n                candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> 3-2=1\n                candidate2: 3>2 -> True -> 2-1=1\n                M = 3-1=2\n\n                Then ans = min(1,1,2)=1 -> correct.\n\n            Test with [1,1,1,1,1] (all same):\n\n                candidate1: 1<1 -> False -> inf\n                candidate2: 1==1 -> False -> inf\n                M = 1-1=0\n\n                Then ans=0 -> correct.\n\n            Test with [1,2] (two distinct):\n\n                candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> 2-2=0\n                candidate2: 2>1 -> True -> 1-1=0\n                M=2-1=1\n\n                Then ans=0 -> correct.\n\n            However, wait: in [1,2] the original instability is 1. After removing one element, the instability becomes 0. Our candidate1 and candidate2 give 0, so that's correct.\n\n          But wait: in [1,2] we have two elements. The removal of one element leaves one element, so the instability is 0. But our M is 1 (the original). We are including M as a candidate, which is 1. But the actual removal of the min or max gives 0, which is better.\n\n          So the above formula is:\n\n            ans = min( (a[-1]-a[1] if a[0]<a[1] else float('inf'), (a[-2]-a[0] if a[-1]>a[-2] else float('inf'), a[-1]-a[0] )\n\n          However, note: in [1,2] the candidate_remove_min is 0 and candidate_remove_max is 0, so the minimum is 0. We don't need the M (1) because 0 is smaller.\n\n          But what if the array has three elements and the best candidate is M? For example, [1,2,3] we got 1, which is better than M=2.\n\n          Therefore, the above formula works.\n\n          However, note: we must consider that the array might have more than one candidate for removal (like multiple min or max) but that doesn't matter because we are only removing one element.\n\n          But wait: what if the array has two min and two max? Example: [1,1,2,2] \n            Original: M=2-1=1.\n            candidate1: condition a[0] < a[1] -> 1<1 -> False -> inf.\n            candidate2: condition a[-1] > a[-2] -> 2>2 -> False -> inf.\n            Then ans = min(inf, inf, 1)=1.\n\n            But what if we remove one element from [1,1,2,2]? \n              Removing a 1: [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n              Removing a 2: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n\n            So the answer is 1, which matches.\n\n          However, what if the array is [1,1,2,3]? \n            Original: M=3-1=2.\n            candidate1: condition 1<1 -> False -> inf.\n            candidate2: condition 3>2 -> True -> 2-1=1.\n            Then ans = min(inf, 1, 2)=1.\n\n            Let's verify: \n              Removing the 3: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n              Removing a 1: [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability 2.\n              Removing the 2: [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability 2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n          One more: [1,2,2,3] \n            Original: M=3-1=2.\n            candidate1: 1<2 -> True -> 3-2=1.\n            candidate2: 3>2 -> True -> 2-1=1.\n            Then ans=min(1,1,2)=1.\n\n            Verify:\n              Removing the 1: [2,2,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> 1.\n              Removing the 3: [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> 1.\n              Removing a 2: [1,2,3] -> 2.\n\n          Therefore, the code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort()\n            candidate1 = float('inf')\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n            if n >= 2:\n                # Check for candidate_remove_min\n                if a[0] < a[1]:\n                    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                # Check for candidate_remove_max\n                if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n                    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n                ans = min(candidate1, candidate2, a[-1]-a[0])\n                print(ans)\n            else:\n                # According to the problem, n>=2, but just in case.\n                print(0)\n\n          But wait: the array size is at least 2, so we don't need the else.\n\n          However, note: the array has at least 2 elements.\n\n          But wait: what if the array has 100000 elements? Then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the instability of the array can only be reduced by removing either the unique minimum or the unique maximum element from the array. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum or maximum, removing one occurrence does not change the minimum or maximum values, respectively, thus leaving the instability unchanged.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the candidates for removal. The potential candidates are:\n   - The last element (maximum) if it is unique.\n   - The first element (minimum) if it is unique.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: After sorting the array, we check if the first element is unique (i.e., different from the second element). If so, removing it could potentially reduce the instability to the difference between the last element and the second element. Similarly, if the last element is unique (different from the second last), removing it could reduce the instability to the difference between the second last element and the first element. The minimal instability among these candidates and the original instability (if no unique min or max exists) is our answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\). The subsequent checks are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\ncandidate1 = float('inf')\ncandidate2 = float('inf')\n\nif a[0] < a[1]:\n    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\nif a[-1] > a[-2]:\n    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nans = min(candidate1, candidate2, a[-1] - a[0])\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - `candidate1` is set to the difference between the last element and the second element if the first element is unique (i.e., `a[0] < a[1]`).\n   - `candidate2` is set to the difference between the second last element and the first element if the last element is unique (i.e., `a[-1] > a[-2]`).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum value among `candidate1`, `candidate2`, and the original instability (`a[-1] - a[0]`). This ensures we consider all possible scenarios where removing an element could minimize the instability.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal instability achievable by removing exactly one element from the array.",
