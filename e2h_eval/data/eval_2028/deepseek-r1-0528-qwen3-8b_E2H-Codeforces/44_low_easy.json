He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n, k and a list of n integers.\n Conditions: \n   - We have to split the list of n problems into exactly k contiguous segments (each day solves a contiguous sequence from the start).\n   - The profit of a day is the maximum difficulty in that contiguous segment.\n   - We wish to maximize the total profit.\n\n Observation:\n   Since the days must be contiguous and cover the entire list, we are effectively making k-1 cuts between the n problems.\n\n However, note: the problem requires that each day's profit is the maximum of the contiguous segment. The total profit is the sum of these maxima.\n\n Important: Because the array is fixed and we are splitting contiguously, the profit for a segment [l, r] is simply the maximum value in that segment.\n\n We can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit we can get by splitting the first i problems into j days.\n\n But note: n, k up to 2000 -> O(n*k) states, but then each state might require O(n) to compute, leading to O(n^2*k) which is 8e9 for n=2000, which is too slow.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem has a structure similar to matrix chain or other optimization problems with monotonicity.\n\n Another idea: \n   We know that the entire array is fixed. We can precompute the maximums for segments? Actually, we can use the concept of \"next greater element\" to help.\n\n However, note that we are forced to take contiguous segments from the beginning. \n\n Observation: In any valid segmentation, the last day must end at the last problem. We can consider breaking the array from the right.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy or two-pointer approach. But note: the problem asks for maximum total profit.\n\n Another known fact: In a segmentation problem where the cost for a segment is the maximum, we can use the idea of \"breaking at peaks\".\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: \n   Let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n   Then, we have: \n        dp[i][j] = max_{1 <= t < i} { dp[t][j-1] + max(a[t+1:i+1]) }\n\n   But how to compute max(a[t+1:i+1]) quickly? We can precompute a 2D table for range maximum queries, but that would be O(n^2) which is acceptable for n=2000? 2000^2 = 4e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize.\n\n   However, the state is O(n*k) = 2000*2000 = 4e6, and for each state we do an inner loop over t from 1 to i-1, so worst-case i=2000, then we do 1999 operations for each state. So total operations would be about 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need to optimize the DP.\n\n Idea 2: \n   Instead, we can precompute the next greater element to the right (or left) to help. But note our condition: the segment [t+1, i] must be contiguous.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n      Let M(i) = the maximum value from 1 to i.\n\n   But wait, the maximum of [t+1, i] can be computed if we know the next greater element. However, note that the maximum of [t+1, i] is the same as the maximum from t+1 to i.\n\n   We can precompute a 2D array for all segments? That would be too heavy.\n\n Idea 3: \n   We can use the following: \n        Let f(i) be the maximum value in the prefix [0:i] (i.e., up to index i-1). But that doesn't help for arbitrary segments.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a sparse table for range maximum queries, but building it is O(n log n) and then each query O(1). But then the DP would still iterate over t for each i, so we cannot avoid the O(n) per state.\n\n   We need a smarter way to update the DP.\n\n Observation: \n   The profit of a segment is the maximum element in that segment. Therefore, the entire array's maximum must appear in one segment, and that segment will contribute its value. Moreover, the maximums are non-decreasing as we move the cut to the right (if we fix the last segment, then the maximum of the previous segments might be increasing).\n\n Another idea: \n   We can use a greedy segmentation from right to left. Notice that the last day must cover the entire suffix until the end.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving problems over exactly `k` days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The problems must be solved in contiguous segments from the start of the list, and all problems must be solved exactly once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the profit for each day is determined by the maximum difficulty in the segment of problems solved that day. The challenge is to split the list of problems into `k` contiguous segments such that the sum of these maxima is maximized.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit obtainable by splitting the first `i` problems into `j` days. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   dp[i][j] = \\max_{t < i} \\left( dp[t][j-1] + \\text{max}(a[t+1..i]) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Here, `max(a[t+1..i])` is the maximum difficulty in the segment from `t+1` to `i`.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly computing `max(a[t+1..i])` for all `t` and `i` would be too slow (O(n^3)). Instead, we precompute the maximum values for all segments ending at each position using a 2D array `max_val[i][j]`, which stores the maximum value from `i` to `j`. This allows us to compute the required maximums in constant time during the DP step.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the segments that form the optimal solution. We start from the end of the problem list and move backwards, using the DP table to find where the last segment begins.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        print(sum(a))\n        print(n)\n        return\n\n    max_val = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_val[i][i+1] = a[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j-1], a[j-1])\n            \n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1] = max_val[0][i]\n        \n    for j in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            best = 0\n            for t in range(j-1, i):\n                candidate = dp[t][j-1] + max_val[t][i]\n                if candidate > best:\n                    best = candidate\n            dp[i][j] = best\n\n    total_profit = dp[n][k]\n    print(total_profit)\n    \n    segments = []\n    start = n\n    for day in range(k, 0, -1):\n        pos = 0\n        for t in range(day-1, start):\n            if dp[t][day-1] + max_val[t][start] == dp[start][day]:\n                pos = t\n        segments.append(start - pos)\n        start = pos\n        \n    segments.reverse()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, segments)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If there's only one day (`k == 1`), the total profit is simply the sum of all problem difficulties, and the entire list is solved in one day.\n3. **Precomputing Maximum Values**: The `max_val` 2D array is constructed to store the maximum difficulty between any two indices, allowing O(1) access during the DP phase.\n4. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized for the base case where each day consists of the first `i` problems.\n5. **Filling DP Table**: For each day count from 2 to `k`, and for each possible number of problems `i`, the DP table is filled by considering all possible previous splits and adding the maximum difficulty of the current segment.\n6. **Backtracking for Solution**: After computing the maximum profit, the solution backtracks from the DP table to determine the lengths of the segments for each day, ensuring the total profit is maximized.\n7. **Output**: The maximum total profit and the segment lengths for each day are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal segmentation using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
