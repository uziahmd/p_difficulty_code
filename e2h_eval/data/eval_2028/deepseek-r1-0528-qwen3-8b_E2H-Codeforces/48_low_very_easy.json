            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one string which is either an integer or 'R' (for Roman). But note: the second part may be an integer OR the string 'R'. However, the input format says: the first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25) but then says \"Only b may be replaced by an R\". So actually, the first token is always an integer a (base), and the second token can be either an integer b (the base) or the letter 'R' (meaning Roman numerals).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split into two parts.\n 2. The first part is the base a (integer). The second part is either an integer (if not 'R') or the string 'R'.\n 3. Then read the next line which is the number c in base a.\n\n We have two cases:\n   Case 1: Second token is an integer (say base_b). Then we need to convert the number from base a to base b.\n   Case 2: Second token is 'R'. Then we need to convert the number from base a to a decimal (base 10) first, and then convert that decimal number to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note the problem says: \n   \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n But if b is 'R', then base b is the Roman numeral system.\n\n Important: The Roman numeral conversion is only used when the second token is 'R'. Also, the input number c is given in base a.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n Case 1: Convert base a to base b (both integers between 2 and 25, so we can do standard base conversion)\n\n   Step 1: Convert the string `c` (which is in base a) to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n        Since the number might have leading zeros and its length can be up to 1000, we have to handle that.\n\n        How to convert a string of digits in base a (with digits beyond 9 represented by letters? Note: the problem says \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\")?\n\n        Example: base 12, the digit 'A' represents 10.\n\n        But note: the input string `c` is given in base a. The digits can be from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to ... (if base > 10). However, the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^10^15\" — wait, that seems confusing. Actually, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10**15**10\" — but wait, that is a very big number. Actually, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be <= 300010 and not 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10**15**10.\" \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but that is a typo. Actually, the example inputs are small. But the problem says that the length is at most 1000, so we must handle up to 1000-digit numbers in base a (which can be up to base 25). This could be a very big number.\n\n        We cannot use standard int conversion for such big numbers because Python's int can handle arbitrary large numbers, but we have to be cautious with base conversion.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that in the case without Roman numerals, the number is at most 10^15^10? That is 10^(15*10) = 10^150, which is too big for standard integer conversion? Actually, no, because the base a is at most 25, and the number has at most 1000 digits. The maximum value is (25^1000 - 1) which is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^1000*1.39",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a decimal (base 10) and then converting this decimal number to the desired target base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and the target base (b), which could be either an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: Convert the input number from the source base to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value using the base.\n3. **Target Base Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Target Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the decimal number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n   - **Roman Numeral Target Base**: If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral. This involves mapping decimal values to corresponding Roman numeral symbols, considering subtractive notation for values like 4 (IV) and 9 (IX).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numerals(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for numeral, val in val:\n        while n >= numeral:\n            res += val\n            n -= numeral\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    second_part = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if second_part == 'R':\n        base_b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            base_b = int(second_part)\n        except:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n    def convert_base_to_decimal(s, base):\n        total = 0\n        length = len(s)\n        for i, char in enumerate(s):\n            digit_val = int(char) if char.isdigit() else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n            power = length - i - 1\n            total += digit_val * (base ** power)\n        return total\n\n    decimal_value = convert_base_to_decimal(num_str, base_a)\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        if decimal_value == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n        else:\n            print(roman_numerals(decimal_value))\n    else:\n        base_b_int = int(base_b)\n        if base_b_int == 1:\n            s = \"\"\n            for _ in range(decimal_value):\n                s += '1'\n            print(s)\n        else:\n            if decimal_value == 0:\n                print(\"0\")\n            else:\n                digits = []\n                num = decimal_value\n                while num > 0:\n                    remainder = num % base_b_int\n                    digits.append(remainder)\n                    num //= base_b_int\n                res = ''\n                for d in reversed(digits):\n                    if d < 10:\n                        res += str(d)\n                    else:\n                        res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n                print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input lines, parsing the source base (a) and target base (b). The input number is read as a string since it can be very large.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `convert_base_to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value based on its position and the source base, then sums these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `roman_numerals` converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral by iteratively subtracting the largest possible values from the decimal number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For integer target bases, the decimal number is converted by repeated division, with remainders collected to form digits in the target base. Digits greater than 9 are represented by letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness for all specified edge cases.",
