You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj.

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits, but each digit from s can be used only once.\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n We have two strings: \n   a: the original number (as string) of length n.\n   s: the sequence of digits (as string) of length m.\n\n Since we can use each digit in s at most once, we have a multiset of available replacement digits.\n\n We are allowed to choose any set of positions (at most one replacement per position) and assign to them some digits from s (each digit from s can be used only once).\n\n How to maximize the number?\n We want to make the leftmost digits as large as possible.\n\n Strategy:\n 1. We can sort the available digits in s in descending order (or ascending, but we'll use the largest first for replacements).\n 2. However, note: we cannot break the relative order of the original digits? Actually, we are allowed to choose any positions arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the problem says we can choose an arbitrary position i and replace it with sj, and each element in s can be used at most once.\n\n So we have a set of replacement digits (with multiplicities) and we can assign them to any positions we wish, but each replacement digit can be used only once.\n\n Since we are allowed to skip some, we want to use the best ones.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if we replace a digit in a more significant (left) position, that has a bigger impact.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea:\n  - We want to try to replace digits from left to right, but we might not have enough good digits to replace all the way.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  We can consider: we have a multiset of replacement digits. We want to assign the largest available replacement digits to the most significant positions (from left to right) where they can improve the digit.\n\n  However, note: sometimes we might not want to use a very large digit if we can only use it in a less significant position? But wait, we are allowed to choose which positions to replace. So we would always prefer to use a larger digit in a more significant position.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the string s (the available digits) in descending order. Then we have the best digits available.\n\n  Step 2: We traverse the original number from left to right. For each position, we consider: if we can replace the current digit with a larger digit from s, then we do so. But note: we are allowed to use the same digit multiple times? No, because each element in s is used at most once.\n\n  However, we don't want to use a digit just because it's large if we can use it even more in a more significant position? Actually, we are going from left to right, so we should use the largest available digits on the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to skip a digit in s. So we can use the largest digits first.\n\n  However, here's a catch: we might have a situation where a digit is already large, so we don't need to replace it. But we also have to consider that we might have multiple same digits and we can use them later.\n\n  Detailed plan:\n\n  We have two arrays: the original digits and the sorted available digits (from high to low).\n\n  We'll create a list (or string) for the result, initially the original number.\n\n  But note: we cannot change the length of the number? Actually, the problem doesn't say we can't, but note: if we replace a digit with a digit, the length remains the same. The original number doesn't have leading zeros, and we are not introducing leading zeros because we are replacing from left to right and if we replace the first digit, we must ensure we don't put a zero? Actually, the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeroes. But note: if the original number has a non-zero first digit, and we replace it with a non-zero, that's okay. However, what if we replace the first digit with zero? That would be a leading zero and is not allowed. Therefore, we must not replace a digit in the first position if the replacement digit is '0' and the original digit is non-zero? Actually, we can avoid that by not using a zero in the first position.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are allowed to use not all elements. So we can choose not to use a zero for the first replacement.\n\n  However, what if we have a zero in our available digits? We can use it for a replacement only if the current digit is not the first and the current digit is less than or equal to zero? Actually, if the current digit is less than or equal to zero, then replacing with zero might not be beneficial, unless we are forced to use the digit? But wait, we are trying to maximize the number.\n\n  Let me reframe:\n\n  We have a multiset of replacement digits. We want to assign them optimally to the positions. We are free to choose which positions to replace.\n\n  We can think greedily:\n\n  - We have a fixed set of replacement digits (sorted in descending order). We want to assign the largest digits to the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n  However, we cannot assign a digit that is smaller than the current digit to a position and expect improvement? Actually, we can only assign a digit to a position if we want to improve the overall number. But note: if we have a choice between two positions and two digits, we want the largest digit in the most significant position.\n\n  But wait: what if we have two positions: \n      Original: ['1', '2']\n      Available: ['3', '0']\n\n  We can replace the first digit with 3 -> becomes \"32\", which is better than replacing the second digit with 0 -> \"10\" (but wait, \"10\" is worse than \"32\"). However, if we replace the first digit with 3, we get 32, but if we replace the second digit with 0, we get 10. Clearly 32 is better.\n\n  However, what if we have:\n      Original: ['9','9'] and available: ['8','7'] -> then we don't want to replace any.\n\n  So the idea is: for each position, we want to know the maximum digit we can assign without violating the condition that we can only use each available digit once, and we want to assign the best available digits to the leftmost positions.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Sort the available digits (s) in descending order. Then, we will use the largest ones first.\n\n  2. We traverse the original number from left to right. For each position, we check: if there exists an available digit that is greater than the current digit, then we should use the smallest digit that is greater than the current one? Or the largest? \n\n  Actually, we want to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit? But no, we have a fixed set of digits. We want to reserve the larger digits for more significant positions. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n  We are going to try to replace a digit at a position only if we can get a digit that is strictly greater than the current one. But we don't necessarily have to use the largest available digit for this position. We can use a slightly larger one to save the larger ones for more significant positions? \n\n  However, note: we are processing from left to right. The more left a position, the more significant. So we want to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one? But wait, if we use a very large digit now, then we might not have a digit to use in a more significant position? Actually, we are processing from left to right, so the current position is more significant than the next. Therefore, we want to assign the largest available digit that is greater than the current one? \n\n  But consider: if we have two available digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"12\". \n      Position 0: current digit is '1'. We can use either '9' or '8'. We should use the largest one, '9', to get 92 (which is better than 82). \n\n  However, if we have two available digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"19\".\n      Position 0: current digit is '1'. We can use '9' to get 99 (which is better than 89). \n\n  But what if we have two available digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"89\"?\n      Position 0: current digit is '8'. We can use '9' to get 99, which is better than 89.\n\n  However, what if the number is \"98\"? \n      Position 0: current digit is '9'. We cannot use '9' because that doesn't improve, and we don't want to use a digit that is not improving? Actually, we are allowed to use a digit that is equal or greater? But note: if we use a digit that is equal, then the number doesn't change. But we are allowed to use it, but why would we? We can skip it. However, if we have a digit that is equal, we might as well skip because it doesn't help. But wait, what if we have two same digits and we have to decide which one to use? Actually, we don't have to use them if they don't improve.\n\n  But note: sometimes we might have a situation where we have a digit that is equal, and we are forced to use a digit that is not improving? Actually, no, we are allowed to skip.\n\n  However, let me clarify: we are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n  We have a multiset of available digits (we can use each at most once). We want to assign them to positions to maximize the number.\n\n  We can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n  Step 2: We'll traverse the original number from left to right. For each position, we consider: what is the best digit we can assign to this position from the remaining available digits? \n\n  But note: we are not forced to use a digit that is greater than the current one. However, using a digit that is less than or equal to the current one would not improve the number, so we only consider digits greater than the current one.\n\n  However, wait: what if we have a digit that is greater than the current one, but we have two such digits and we want to save the larger one for a later position? But we are processing from left to right, so the current position is the most significant. We want to assign the best digit (largest) that is greater than the current one to the current position.\n\n  But then, how do we manage the available digits? We need to take the largest digit that is greater than the current one, and then remove that digit from the available set.\n\n  However, we don't necessarily have to use the largest one. Consider: if we have two digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"12\", then we want to use '9' for the first position. But if we have two digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"18\", then we can use '9' for the first position (making it \"98\") which is better than using '8' (making it \"18\"->\"18\" becomes \"88\", but wait: actually, we are allowed to choose which positions to replace. \n\n  Correction: In the example \"18\" and available digits ['9','8']: \n      Option 1: Replace first digit: \n          With '9': becomes \"98\"\n          With '8': becomes \"88\"\n      Option 2: Replace second digit: \n          With '9': becomes \"19\"\n          With '8': becomes \"18\"\n\n  The best is \"98\".\n\n  Now, if we have two digits: ['9','8'] and the number is \"12\", we use the largest available digit for the first position.\n\n  But what if we have multiple digits that are greater than the current one? We want to use the largest one for the current position because we are at a more significant place.\n\n  However, what if we have a limited supply? We have a multiset. We can use each once.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  Let's maintain a list (or a sorted list) of available digits. We want to quickly find the largest digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n  But note: we are going from left to right, and we want to use the largest digit that is greater than the current one. However, we might have many digits and we want to avoid scanning the entire list for each position.\n\n  We can pre-sort the available digits in descending order, and then use a pointer or a heap?\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer or a greedy matching by sorting both the available digits and the original digits, but that doesn't account for positions.\n\n  Another idea: \n\n  We know we are going to use at most min(n, m) replacements.\n\n  We can try to simulate:\n\n  We have the original number as a list of characters.\n\n  We have a multiset (or a sorted list) of available digits.\n\n  We want to assign the best available digits (from high to low) to the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n  However, we cannot assign a digit that is not greater than the current digit (unless we want to? Actually, no: because if we assign a digit that is not greater, then the number doesn't improve. And since we can skip, we don't have to assign. But wait, if we have a digit that is equal, we can assign it and the number doesn't change, but we are using a digit. However, we are allowed to skip. So we don't have to use it.\n\n  Therefore, we only consider digits that are strictly greater.\n\n  But wait: what if we have a digit that is equal? Then we can skip. However, sometimes we might have to use a digit that is equal to avoid using a digit that is less? Actually, no. We are allowed to skip, so we don't have to use any digit.\n\n  However, there is a twist: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. We are not forced to use the best digit for the first position if we can use a slightly smaller one and then use the best one for a later position? \n\n  Example: \n      Original: \"1234\"\n      Available: ['3','4']\n\n      Option 1: Use '4' for the first position -> \"4234\" -> but wait, we can use the digit '4' for the first position? Yes, because 4>1. Then we have one digit left: '3'. Then we can use it for the second position? 3>2 -> so we get \"4334\". \n      Option 2: Use '3' for the first position -> \"3234\", then use '4' for the second position -> 4>2 -> \"3434\". Now compare \"4334\" and \"3434\": \n          4334 > 3434, so Option 1 is better.\n\n  So the rule: we want to assign the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit to the current position, then remove that digit and move on.\n\n  But wait, in the above example, when we use the largest available digit for the first position, we get a larger number. However, consider:\n\n      Original: \"1234\"\n      Available: ['3','2']\n\n      Here, we have two digits: '3' and '2'. \n        If we use '3' for the first position: \"3234\" -> then we have '2' for the second: 2==2 -> skip, so the number is \"3234\".\n        If we use '2' for the first position: \"2234\" -> then we have '3' for the second: 3>2 -> \"2334\", which is 2334 < 3234.\n\n      So using the larger digit for the first position is better.\n\n  However, consider:\n\n      Original: \"1324\"\n      Available: ['3','2']\n\n      First position: \n        Option: use '3'? -> then the number becomes \"3324\". Then we have the digit '2' for the second position: current digit is '3', and 2<3 -> skip. Result: \"3324\".\n        Option: use '2'? -> then the number becomes \"2324\". Then we have '3' for the second position: 3==3 -> skip. Result: \"2324\", which is worse.\n\n      Now, what if we use the digit '2' for the second position? But wait, we are processing from left to right. We are allowed to choose any positions arbitrarily, so we don't have to assign the digits in the order of the original number? \n\n  Wait, note: we are allowed to choose any positions arbitrarily. So we can choose to replace the second digit first? Actually, no: we are processing from left to right, but the replacement can be done in any order. However, the goal is to maximize the entire number. \n\n  But note: the leftmost digit has the highest weight. So we must prioritize the leftmost digit.\n\n  However, the catch: we are allowed to choose the positions arbitrarily. So we can replace any digit in the number arbitrarily (any subset of positions). We are not constrained to replace from left to right.\n\n  But then the problem becomes: we have a multiset of digits (from s) and we can assign them arbitrarily to any positions (each position at most once). We want to maximize the number.\n\n  This is similar to: we have an array (the digits of a) and we can change up to k digits (k <= min(n, m)) to any digits from s (each from s only once) and we want to maximize the number.\n\n  Standard solution for such problems:\n\n  We can consider: we want to assign the largest available digits to the leftmost positions that are necessary. \n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Sort the available digits (s) in descending order.\n\n  2. We want to form an array (or string) of the same length as a. We can think: we are going to replace some digits. We want to replace a digit at a position if and only if we can get a digit that is larger than the current one, and we want to use the largest available digits first.\n\n  However, we can use a greedy algorithm that goes from left to right and for each position, we try to replace the current digit with the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But wait, we are allowed to skip, so we only replace if we can get an improvement.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. We don't have to assign the largest digit to the first position if we can assign a slightly smaller one and then use the largest one for a more significant position? Actually, no: the first position is the most significant.\n\n  However, the above example: \n      Original: \"1324\"\n      Available: ['3','2']\n\n      We have two digits: [3,2] (sorted descending: [3,2])\n\n      We can assign the '3' to the first position: then we get \"3324\", which is better than assigning the '2' to the first position.\n\n  But what if we have:\n\n      Original: \"1999\"\n      Available: ['8','7','6','5','4','3','2','1']\n\n      We can only replace one digit. We would replace the first digit if we can get a digit greater than '1'. The largest available is '8', so we replace the first digit with '8', getting \"8999\".\n\n      But wait, we have many digits, but we can only use each once.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n  We have a multiset of available digits (we can use each once). We want to assign them to the positions to maximize the number.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n  Step 2: We'll create an array for the result, initially the original digits.\n\n  Step 3: We'll use a pointer j for the available digits (starting from the largest).\n\n  However, we can use a two-pass method:\n\n  Pass 1: We want to replace as many leftmost digits as possible with the largest available digits.\n\n  But note: we cannot assign a digit to two positions.\n\n  Alternative efficient method:\n\n  We can use a greedy algorithm that uses a priority queue (max-heap) for the available digits, but then we have to consider that we are going to use the largest ones first.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  - Sort the available digits (s) in descending order, and then we can use a pointer to traverse from the largest.\n\n  - Traverse the original number from left to right:\n\n      Let current_digit = int(original[i])\n      We look for the largest digit in the available set that is greater than current_digit. But we don't want to use a digit that is too large for a later position? Actually, we are going from left to right, so we use the largest available digit that is greater than current_digit for the current position.\n\n      However, we don't know which digit is the largest that is greater than current_digit. We can keep a sorted list of available digits, and then do a binary search for the smallest digit that is greater than current_digit, and then take the largest digit that is greater than current_digit? \n\n      But note: we want the largest digit that is greater than current_digit. Actually, we don't care about the rest, because we are going to use the best available digits for the leftmost positions.\n\n      However, we can simply take the largest available digit that is greater than current_digit. But we have to update the available set.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  We can use a list for available digits and then sort it each time? That would be O(m) per position, which is too slow (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n  Instead, we can use a balanced BST? But in Python we don't have one in the standard library.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a max-heap for the available digits, but then we cannot easily query the largest digit that is greater than current_digit.\n\n  Another idea: \n\n  We are going to use the largest available digits first. We can sort the available digits in descending order, and then use a pointer to the current candidate. But note: we want to assign the largest digit that is greater than current_digit, but the largest digit overall might be too large for a later position? Actually, no: we are processing from left to right, so we want to use the largest digit that is greater than the current_digit for the current position.\n\n  But wait: what if the largest digit is greater than the current_digit, but we have a digit that is only slightly larger than the current_digit and we want to save the largest digit for a later position? \n\n  Example:\n\n      Original: \"1234\"\n      Available: ['9','8','7','6','5','4','3','2']\n\n      We have many digits. We want to assign the best digits to the leftmost positions.\n\n      For the first digit '1': we can use '9'. Then for the second digit '2': we can use '8'. Then for the third digit '3': we can use '7'. Then for the fourth digit '4': we can use '6'. \n\n      The result: \"9876\", which is the best.\n\n  But what if we have:\n\n      Original: \"1234\"\n      Available: ['9','8','7','6','5','4','3','2','1'] (same as above but one extra)\n\n      Then we use the same: \"9876...\"\n\n  But consider:\n\n      Original: \"1234\"\n      Available: ['9','1','8','2','7','3','6','4','5'] -> wait, we have duplicates? Actually, we have one of each.\n\n      We want to use the largest digits for the leftmost positions.\n\n      Step-by-step:\n\n        Position0: current_digit='1'. The largest digit in available that is >'1' is '9'. Use '9'. Remove '9'. Now available: ['8','7','6','5','4','3','2','1'] (sorted descending: [8,7,...,1])\n        Position1: current_digit='2'. The largest digit in available that is >'2' is '8'. Use '8'. Remove '8'. Now available: [7,6,...,1]\n        Position2: current_digit='3'. The largest digit in available that is >'3' is '7'. Use '7'. Remove '7'. Now available: [6,5,...,1]\n        Position3: current_digit='4'. The largest digit in available that is >'4' is '6'. Use '6'. Remove '6'. Now available: [5,4,...,1]\n\n        Result: \"9876\"\n\n      But what if we did not use the largest available digit for the first position? What if we used '5' for the first position? Then we could use '9' for the second? But the second position is more significant than the first? Actually, no: the first position is more significant. We want the first digit to be as large as possible.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n      Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n      We'll maintain a list (or a sorted list) for available digits.\n\n      We traverse the original number from left to right.\n\n      For each digit d (converted to int) at position i:\n\n        We want to find the largest digit in the available set that is greater than d. But note: we are going to use the largest available digit that is greater than d for this position.\n\n        However, we can use a different approach: we are going to use the largest available digit for the entire set for the first position that it can improve. But we must assign the largest digit to the most significant position.\n\n        Actually, we can use a greedy: we are going to use the largest digit in the available set for the first position that we can improve. But wait, we are processing from left to right, so we must use the largest digit that is greater than the current digit for the current position.\n\n        However, we can precompute: we have a sorted list (descending) of available digits. Then we can do:\n\n          candidate = None\n          # We want the largest digit that is greater than d. Since the list is sorted descending, we can traverse until we find one that is greater than d.\n\n        But we can use a pointer that starts at the beginning (largest) and then moves until we find a digit greater than d.\n\n        However, we are going to use the first candidate that is greater than d? Actually, we want the largest digit that is greater than d. In a descending sorted list, the first digit that is greater than d is the largest one.\n\n        But wait, if we have [9,8,7,6] and d=5, then 9 is the largest and greater than 5. But if we have [9,8,7,6] and d=8, then the first digit that is greater than 8 is 9? Then we use 9. But if d=8, then 9 is greater, so we use 9. But what if we have d=8 and available=[9,7]? Then the largest digit greater than 8 is 9.\n\n        However, note: we are going to use the largest digit that is greater than d. But if we use 9 for a digit 8, then we are using a digit that is much larger, which is good.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            Original: \"18\"\n            Available: ['9','7']\n\n            We want to use 9 for the first digit: becomes \"98\", which is better than using 7 for the first digit (then we use 9 for the second: but the second digit is 8, and 9>8 -> \"19\" vs \"98\": \"98\" is better.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read the original number as a string, and the sequence s as a string.\n\n          Step 2: Create a list from s and sort it in descending order.\n\n          Step 3: Convert the original number to a list of characters (or just use string indexing).\n\n          Step 4: We'll also keep an index for the available digits (starting at 0 for the largest).\n\n          However, we cannot simply take the first available digit that is greater than d because the available list is sorted descending. We can do:\n\n            Let j = 0 (pointer for available digits)\n            But wait, we are going to use the largest available digit that is greater than d. Since the list is sorted descending, the first digit we meet that is greater than d is the largest.\n\n          But note: we are going to use the largest digit that is greater than d. So we can do:\n\n            candidate = None\n            # We are going to iterate the available list until we find a digit greater than d, but we want the largest, so we can just take the first one that is greater than d? \n\n          However, we don't want to remove an arbitrary digit. We have a sorted list, and we want to remove the digit we use.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We have a list `avail` (sorted descending). We want to find the first digit (from left) that is greater than d. Then we use that digit and remove it.\n\n          But note: what if there are multiple digits greater than d? We want the largest one, which is the first one we meet.\n\n          However, the list is sorted descending, so the first element is the largest. Then the next is the next largest, etc.\n\n          So:\n\n            For the current digit d (converted to int), we look at the beginning of the available list until we find a digit (as char) that is greater than the current char (we can compare by converting to int, but we can also compare lexicographically since they are digits).\n\n          But note: we have the available digits as a string of digits. We can compare by:\n\n            current_char = original[i]\n            We want to find the largest digit in avail that is > current_char.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            candidate_index = 0\n            candidate_digit = None\n            while candidate_index < len(avail) and avail[candidate_index] >= current_char:\n                candidate_index += 1\n\n            Then, if candidate_index < len(avail): \n                candidate_digit = avail[candidate_index]\n                Then we remove the element at candidate_index? But wait, we have a sorted list, and we want to remove one occurrence.\n\n          However, we don't know if there are duplicates. But we are removing one occurrence.\n\n          But wait: we are using the largest digit that is greater than the current_char. But if we have multiple digits that are greater, we want the largest. The first one we meet (at candidate_index) is the largest.\n\n          However, we are traversing from the beginning (largest) and we stop at the first one that is greater. Then we use that one.\n\n          But note: what if the available list is not sorted? We sorted it descending.\n\n          Example: \n              Original: \"1234\", Available: ['9','8','7','6'] -> sorted descending: ['9','8','7','6']\n              For '1': candidate_index: \n                  '9' >= '1' -> yes, so we move to next? Actually, we are checking for >= and then we break at the first that is greater. But note: we want strictly greater.\n\n          Correction: We want strictly greater. So we should break when we find a digit that is greater than the current.\n\n          But wait, we are comparing: if avail[candidate_index] >= current_char -> then we skip. Then we break when we find one that is greater. \n\n          However, we are checking for >= and then skip. Then we break at the first that is greater. But then we are skipping all the digits that are equal or less. Then we take the first that is greater.\n\n          But note: we want to use a digit that is strictly greater. So we should skip the ones that are <=.\n\n          However, we are allowed to use a digit that is equal? But if we use a digit that is equal, then the number doesn't change. And we are allowed to skip. So we don't have to use a digit that is equal. Therefore, we only consider digits that are strictly greater.\n\n          So the condition should be: while candidate_index < len(avail) and avail[candidate_index] == current_char or avail[candidate_index] < current_char? Actually, we want to skip digits that are <= current_char, and take the first that is >.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            while candidate_index < len(avail) and avail[candidate_index] <= current_char:\n                candidate_index += 1\n\n            Then, if candidate_index < len(avail):\n                candidate_digit = avail[candidate_index]\n\n          But wait, we want the largest digit that is greater than current_char. In a descending sorted list, the first digit that is greater than current_char is the largest.\n\n          However, we are skipping all digits that are <= current_char, so the next one is the first digit that is greater, which is the largest.\n\n          But note: we are removing the digit at candidate_index. Then we have to remove that element from the list.\n\n          However, we are using a list and we are going to remove an element by index. Then we have to shift the list, which is O(n). We cannot do that for each position (n up to 10^5) because worst-case we do 10^5 removals, each O(n) -> 10^10 operations.\n\n  We need a more efficient data structure.\n\n  We can use a balanced BST? Or we can use a Fenwick tree? Or we can use a different approach.\n\n  Alternatively, we can precompute the entire set of available digits and then use a heap? But we need to remove arbitrary elements.\n\n  We can use a max-heap and a multiset? Actually, we can use a sorted list and use bisect to find the candidate, but removal is costly.\n\n  Another idea: we can use a greedy matching by processing the available digits from largest to smallest and assign them to the leftmost positions that they can improve.\n\n  We can:\n\n      Step 1: Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n      Step 2: We'll also create an array (or list) for the original digits.\n\n      Step 3: We want to assign the available digits to the positions. We can try to assign the largest digit to the leftmost position that it can improve.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to choose any positions arbitrarily. So we can consider: we have a multiset of available digits. We want to maximize the number. The best way is to replace the leftmost digits with the largest available digits.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          We'll create an array `res` of the original digits.\n\n          We'll also create a pointer j for the available digits (from largest to smallest).\n\n          Then, we traverse the positions from left to right, and for each position, we check: if we have an available digit that is greater than the current digit, then we use the largest available digit (since we are traversing from largest to smallest) and assign it to this position.\n\n          But wait, we are going to use the available digits in descending order. We can do:\n\n            j = 0  # pointer for available digits (sorted descending)\n            res = list(a)   # original digits\n\n            # We want to assign the largest available digits to the leftmost positions that are not already the maximum possible.\n\n            However, we cannot assign a digit to a position if we haven't checked all positions? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We'll have a list of available digits (sorted descending).\n\n            We'll create an array `used` of booleans for available digits? Not needed.\n\n            Instead, we can use a pointer for the available digits, and then for each position, we try to use the next available digit (if it is greater than the current digit) for that position.\n\n          But wait, we have a fixed set of available digits. We want to assign the best available digits to the leftmost positions.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We'll iterate over the available digits (from largest to smallest) and for each digit, we find the leftmost position that is not yet replaced and that can be improved by this digit.\n\n          However, that is more complicated.\n\n  Efficient solution:\n\n  We can use a two-pointer method with a balanced BST-like structure, but we can use a sorted list and the bisect module, and then remove the element we use. However, removal from a sorted list is O(n). We can use a balanced BST from the sorted list? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to count the available digits, but that is overkill.\n\n  Another idea: we can use a greedy algorithm that does not require removal of arbitrary elements.\n\n  Note: we are only concerned with the largest digit that is greater than the current digit. And we are going to use each digit once.\n\n  We can precompute the entire set of available digits (as a multiset) and then use a pointer for the available digits (from largest to smallest) and then for each position, we check if the current digit can be improved by the next available digit (if the available digit is greater than the current digit). But we have to assign the available digits to the positions.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to assign the available digits arbitrarily. So we can assign the largest available digit to the leftmost position that it can improve.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Sort the available digits in descending order.\n\n      Step 2: We'll create an array `res` of the original digits.\n\n      Step 3: We'll use an index j for the available",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit from the sequence at most once. The key insight is that the leftmost digits have the highest impact on the number's value, so we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest available digits from the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Available Digits**: First, we sort the sequence of digits in descending order. This allows us to easily access the largest available digits first.\n2. **Traverse the Original Number**: We process each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, we look for the largest digit in the sorted sequence that is greater than the current digit. If such a digit exists, we replace the current digit with it and remove that digit from the sequence (since it can only be used once).\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: To efficiently find the largest digit greater than the current digit, we maintain a pointer for the sorted sequence. Since the sequence is sorted in descending order, the first digit we encounter that is greater than the current digit is the largest possible candidate for replacement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    a_str = data[0].strip()\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    n = len(a_str)\n    m = len(s_str)\n    \n    avail_digits = list(s_str)\n    avail_digits.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    result_list = list(a_str)\n    j = 0\n    count_avail = len(avail_digits)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if j >= count_avail:\n            break\n            \n        current_digit = result_list[i]\n        while j < count_avail and avail_digits[j] <= current_digit:\n            j += 1\n            \n        if j < count_avail and avail_digits[j] > current_digit:\n            result_list[i] = avail_digits[j]\n            j += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(result_list))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines: the original number and the sequence of digits to use for replacements.\n2. **Sorting Digits**: The sequence of digits is sorted in descending order to prioritize larger digits for replacement.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number (from left to right), we check if there's a larger digit available in the sorted sequence. If found, we replace the current digit with the largest available digit and move the pointer in the sequence to the next digit.\n4. **Output**: The modified number is constructed by joining the processed digits and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the most significant digits are maximized first, leading to the largest possible number after all possible replacements. The algorithm efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging sorting and a single pass through the original number and the sequence of digits.",
