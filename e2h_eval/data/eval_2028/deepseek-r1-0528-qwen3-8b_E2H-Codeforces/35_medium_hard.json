    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s which is the binary representation of m (without spaces)\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as the sum of a_i for every bit i that is set in x.\n        However, note that the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the binary representation of m \n        is given as a string of length n (so m has exactly n bits, from least significant bit (rightmost) to most significant (leftmost)).\n\n But note: the example input says:\n      Input: \n          2\n          3 8\n          10\n\n      Here, n=2, so the array a has two elements: [3,8]\n      The binary representation of m is \"10\", which is 2 in decimal. So m=2.\n\n      Then, x can be 0,1,2 (since 0<=x<=2). \n        f(0): x=0 -> no bits set -> sum = 0\n        f(1): x=1 -> binary '01' (but note: our m's binary representation is given as \"10\", meaning the bits are for exponents 2^0 and 2^1? \n              Actually, the problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} such that m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + ... + s_{n-1}*2^(n-1).\n\n      Therefore, the i-th character in the string (from left to right) corresponds to the bit at position (n-1-i) or wait?\n\n      Let me clarify with the example: \n          Input: \n             5\n             17 0 10 2 1\n             11010\n\n          Here, n=5, so m is represented by 5 bits: \"11010\"\n\n          Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n      But the example says m=11 (which is 1011 in binary) but wait, the example input was:\n\n          Input: \n             5\n             17 0 10 2 1\n             11010\n\n      However, the example output is 27, and the note says: \n          In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n      Wait, there's a discrepancy. The example input says the binary representation is \"11010\", which is 26, not 11.\n\n      Let me re-read the problem: \n          The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\n\n      And the example says: \n          \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\"\n\n      This must be a typo in the example? Or perhaps the example intended two different inputs?\n\n      Actually, looking at the example input provided in the test case:\n\n          ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n      The first one: \n          n=2, a=[3,8], m='10' -> m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n      The second one:\n          n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], m='11010' -> m= 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n      But the example output for the second one is 27.\n\n      And the note says: \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\". \n\n      It appears that the example note has a mistake: they wrote 20,21,23 which are powers of 2, but actually:\n\n          m = 20 + 21 + 23? That doesn't make sense because 20 is 2^0? Or maybe they meant the bits are set at positions 0,1,3? \n\n      Actually, if we consider the array a has indices 0 to 4, then the function f(x) uses the bits of x to index into a. \n      Specifically, if x has k bits set, then we take the a_i for each bit i that is set.\n\n      In the example, they say the maximum is f(5)=a0+a2. \n          5 in binary (with n=5 bits) is 00101, so bits 0 and 2 are set? But wait, our indexing of the bits in the array a is by the exponent:\n\n          The problem says: bit(i) is the i-th position (so the i-th bit, meaning 2^i). But note: the array a has n elements, so we have bits from 0 to n-1.\n\n      In the example, the array a is [17,0,10,2,1]. So:\n          a0 corresponds to bit0 (least significant bit)\n          a1 corresponds to bit1\n          a2 corresponds to bit2\n          a3 corresponds to bit3\n          a4 corresponds to bit4\n\n      Then x=5 (binary 00101) has bits 0 and 2 set, so we take a0 and a2: 17+10=27.\n\n      Now, why does the note say m=11? That would be 11 in decimal, which is 1011 in binary (if we use 4 bits) but we are using 5 bits? \n\n      Actually, the constraint is x <= m. m is given by the binary string. In the example, m=26 (binary 11010). \n      We are allowed to take any x from 0 to 26.\n\n      Why is the maximum 27? Because even though m is 26, we can set the bits that are available in a way that we take positive contributions.\n\n      However, note: the function f(x) does not depend on m directly, except that x cannot exceed m. \n\n      The key is: we want to choose x (with x<=m) that maximizes the sum of a_i for every bit i set in x.\n\n      But note: we are only allowed to set bits that are present in the binary representation of m? Not exactly. We can set any bit i from 0 to n-1, as long as the resulting x is <= m.\n\n      However, if we set a bit that is beyond the bits in m, that would make x larger than m. But note: the binary representation of m has n bits, so the highest bit is 2^(n-1). \n\n      How do we solve this?\n\n      We can think greedily: we want to set as many bits as possible that have positive a_i, but we must ensure that the number x we form is <= m.\n\n      Steps:\n\n      Let the binary representation of m be a string s of length n (without leading zeros, but note: it might have leading zeros? Actually, the problem says: the binary representation of m, so the string length is n, meaning that m is represented with exactly n bits. So the most significant bit is the first character and the least significant is the last.)\n\n      Actually, wait: the problem states that m is given by s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} where m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + ... + s_{n-1}*2^(n-1)? \n\n      Let me check: the example with n=5 and s=\"11010\": \n          m = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^4? \n          Then m = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 11.\n\n      But wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\n      Clarification: the problem says \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as s0s1...s_{n-1}. \n\n      However, standard binary representation: the leftmost digit is the most significant. \n\n      But in the formula: m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + ... + s_{n-1}*2^{n-1}? \n\n      That would be unusual. Typically, we write the binary representation from most significant to least significant, and then the weight of the leftmost is 2^(n-1). \n\n      Actually, the problem statement says: \n          \"Number m equals s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + ... + s_{n-1}*2^{n-1}\"\n\n      But wait, in the example: \n          Input: \n            5\n            17 0 10 2 1\n            11010\n\n          Then m = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^4 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 11.\n\n      And the example says: m=11.\n\n      So the string is given in the order from least significant bit to most significant bit? \n\n      But wait, the example input for the first sample: \n          n=2, m='10'\n\n          Then m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1.\n\n      But the example says: m=2 (because 10 in binary is 2, but here the string is given from LSB to MSB? Then the string should be reversed?).\n\n      Actually, let me read the problem again: \n          \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n      And then the formula: m = s0*2^0 + s1*2^1 + ... + s_{n-1}*2^{n-1}.\n\n      This means that the first character of the string is the least significant bit, and the last character is the most significant bit.\n\n      However, typically we write numbers from most significant to least significant. But the problem's representation is little-endian: the string s is the binary representation in little-endian order (LSB first). \n\n      Example: \n          For m=5 (which is 101 in big-endian), then in little-endian (for 3 bits) we would write the bits from low to high: 1 (bit0), 0 (bit1), 1 (bit2) -> \"101\".\n\n      But wait, that would be 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^2 = 1+0+4=5. Correct.\n\n      So the input string for m is in little-endian: the first character is the 0th bit (LSB), the next is the 1st bit, etc.\n\n      Therefore, we have to reverse the string to get the usual big-endian representation? \n\n      However, note: the problem says the array a has n elements, and the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (which is the bit at 2^i) to add a_i.\n\n      But the array a is given in the order a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n      So a0 corresponds to the 0th bit (LSB), a1 to the 1st bit, etc.\n\n      Now, the problem becomes: we are given the binary representation of m in little-endian (string s) of length n. \n\n      We can also note that the maximum x we can have is m, and we are allowed to set any subset of bits (each bit i has weight 2^i) as long as the total value is <= m.\n\n      We can solve by processing the bits from least significant to most significant (i.e., from index0 to index n-1) and decide whether to set the i-th bit or not.\n\n      However, we must account for the constraint that the number formed must be <= m.\n\n      We can use dynamic programming or greedy:\n\n      Idea:\n\n      Let dp[i] be the maximum sum we can achieve for the first i bits (bits 0 to i-1) and the constraint that we haven't exceeded m in the bits we've already set.\n\n      But note: the bits are independent and the constraint is linear (the entire number must be <= m). \n\n      Alternatively, we can traverse from the least significant bit (bit0) to the most significant (bit n-1) and use a flag that indicates whether we are already below m or not.\n\n      Steps:\n\n      We are going to consider each bit from 0 to n-1 (i.e., from the first character of the string to the last).\n\n      Let:\n        s: the input string (little-endian, so index0 is bit0, index1 is bit1, ... index n-1 is bit n-1)\n\n      We can also precompute the value of m: \n        m_val = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                m_val += (1 << i)   # because bit i is 2^i\n\n      But note: the problem says the array a is given for bits 0 to n-1, and we are allowed to set a bit i only if the corresponding bit in m is 1 or if we are still in the \"free\" part (if we set a bit that is less significant and then in the more significant bits we don't set a bit that exceeds m).\n\n      Actually, we can use a greedy method:\n\n        Let's denote:\n          total = 0   # current sum\n          We start from the least significant bit (i=0) to the most (i=n-1)\n\n        However, the constraint is that the number we build must be <= m.\n\n        We can consider two possibilities for each bit: set it or not, but the decision for a higher bit may depend on the lower bits.\n\n        We can use:\n\n          Let b = list(map(int, list(s)))   # now b[0] is the 0th bit, b[1] is the 1st, etc.\n\n          We'll traverse from bit0 to bit n-1, and keep a variable 'tight' that indicates whether the bits we have chosen so far are exactly the same as m's bits (then we must not exceed m in the remaining bits) or we have already chosen a bit that is 0 when m had a 1 (so we can set any bits arbitrarily in the higher positions).\n\n        But note: we are building the number from low to high, and the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m.\n\n        However, we are building the number from the least significant bit to the most. The standard way is to go from high to low, but here we have the bits from low to high.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reverse the string to get the most significant bit first, but then the weights change.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          We know that the function f(x) is additive. The maximum possible value without the constraint is the sum of all a_i for which a_i>0? But we are constrained by x<=m.\n\n        We can break down the problem:\n\n          Consider that we want to set as many bits as possible that have positive a_i, but we must not set a bit that would make the number exceed m.\n\n          However, sometimes we might skip a bit (even if positive) if by skipping we can set more bits above that would compensate? \n\n          But note: the bits are independent and the value of setting a higher bit is much larger (because 2^i grows exponentially). However, the benefit of setting a bit i is a_i, and the cost is that we must not exceed m.\n\n        Standard solution for this type of problem (digit DP) is to use state (position, tight) and then for each bit we decide to set or not.\n\n        Since n can be up to 10^5, we need an efficient solution.\n\n        Alternatively, note that the function f(x) is linear in the bits. We can compute the maximum by:\n\n          Start from x=0, and then try to set bits one by one, but we have to check the constraint.\n\n        However, 10^5 bits is too many to iterate over all possibilities.\n\n        Let me think of a greedy:\n\n          We are allowed to set a bit i if and only if:\n            - The bit i is not set in m, then we can set it only if in all the bits below (less significant) we set exactly the bits that are set in m (so that we haven't already gone over). But wait, no: if we set a bit i that is not set in m, then we must ensure that in the bits from 0 to i-1 we set exactly the same as m. However, if we set a bit that is not set in m, then the number becomes larger than m? Not necessarily: because if we set a bit that is not set in m, then we must have set all the bits from 0 to i-1 to be less than or equal to m's bits, and then at bit i we set a bit that m doesn't have, then the entire number becomes greater than m. Therefore, we cannot set a bit i if m's bit i is 0.\n\n          But wait, what if we set a bit i that is 0 in m? Then the number becomes larger than m. So we must not set any bit i that is 0 in m, unless we have set some bits below to less than m's bits? \n\n          Actually, the rule is:\n\n          We can set a bit i (which is not set in m) only if in the bits from 0 to i-1 we set strictly less than m's bits. Then, once we set a bit i that is 0 in m, we are free to set any bits above (more significant) arbitrarily (because the number is already greater than m, but wait, we are building from low to high, and the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m). \n\n          However, note: if we set a bit i that is 0 in m, then the number becomes (in the part from 0 to i) greater than m's part (because at bit i we set 1 and m has 0, and the lower bits are the same as m). Therefore, we must not set any bit i that is 0 in m, unless we are free to set the rest arbitrarily (but then we are exceeding m). \n\n          Actually, the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m. So if we set a bit i (at position i) that is 0 in m, then the number we built (so far including bit i) is already greater than m (because the lower bits are the same as m, and at bit i we set 1 when m has 0). \n\n          Therefore, we can only set a bit i (which is 0 in m) if we have already set a bit j (j < i) to 0 while m had 1? No, because then the lower bits are already less, so we can set the bit i arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, we can break the constraint if we set a bit i (that is 0 in m) only if we have set at least one bit j (j < i) to 0 while m had 1. Then, the number we built is less than m in the lower bits, and we can set the bit i arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Let m_bits = list(map(int, list(s)))   # little-endian: index0 is bit0, index1 is bit1, etc.\n\n          We'll traverse from i=0 to n-1:\n\n          We maintain:\n            current_sum = 0\n            tight = True   # meaning so far the bits we have set are exactly the same as m's bits (so we must not set a bit that m doesn't have)\n\n          However, we can also consider: we want to maximize the sum.\n\n          Alternative approach (common in problems like \"Maximum XOR with AND constraints\"):\n\n          We can consider that the maximum value of f(x) is the sum of the a_i for all bits i for which a_i is positive, minus the forced removals due to the constraint.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to set a bit i only if the number we form is <= m.\n\n          Another standard solution: \n\n          We can set all bits i for which a_i > 0, unless by setting a bit i that is 0 in m we would break the constraint. But if we set a bit i that is 0 in m, we must have already set some lower bit to 0 (so that the number is less than m in the lower part). \n\n          Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute the total sum if we set all bits (ignoring the constraint) for which a_i>0. But we must not set bits that are 0 in m, unless we are already below.\n\n          However, we can use:\n\n          Let ans = 0\n          Let base = 0   # the value of m in terms of the bits we set (we don't need the value, but the constraint is the binary representation)\n\n          Instead, we can use:\n\n          We traverse from the least significant bit to the most:\n\n          We keep a variable 'limit' that is the maximum we can set for the remaining bits (if we are tight) or we can set any.\n\n          Actually, we can use a digit DP that goes from bit0 to bit n-1.\n\n          State: (pos, tight) -> the maximum sum we can achieve from bit pos to the end, given that we are tight (meaning the prefix is equal to m's prefix) or not.\n\n          Then, at each bit i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n            If tight:\n                We can choose to set the bit or not.\n\n                Option1: do not set the bit:\n                    Then, if m_bits[i] is 0, then we are still tight? Actually, no: because we didn't set the bit and m_bits[i] is 0, then the prefix is the same as m's prefix so far, so we remain tight.\n                    Then, the next state is (i+1, tight and (0==m_bits[i])) -> but wait, if we set 0 and m_bits[i] is 0, then we remain tight. If m_bits[i] is 1, then we set 0 and m_bits[i] is 1, so we become non-tight.\n\n                Option2: set the bit (only if m_bits[i] is 1 OR if we are not tight? Actually, if tight and m_bits[i] is 0, we cannot set the bit because then the number would exceed m (since the prefix is the same and then we set a 1 at a 0 in m). So:\n\n                  If tight and m_bits[i] is 0: we cannot set the bit.\n\n                  If tight and m_bits[i] is 1: we can set the bit, and then the next state is (i+1, True) because we set the same as m.\n\n            If not tight:\n                We can set the bit arbitrarily (if a_i>0, then we set it) but note: we want to maximize the sum. However, the sum is independent of the actual bit value, so we just add a_i if we set the bit.\n\n          But wait, we are allowed to set the bit arbitrarily even if a_i is negative? Actually, the problem says a_i>=0, so we always set the bit if we are not tight.\n\n          However, note: the problem says a_i>=0, so we always want to set the bit if we are not tight.\n\n          But wait: if we are not tight, we can set the bit arbitrarily, and since a_i>=0, we set it.\n\n          However, we must consider: the function f(x) is the sum of a_i for each set bit. So if we set a bit, we add a_i, regardless of its sign? But the input says a_i>=0.\n\n          So the DP state:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = maximum sum we can achieve from bit i onward, given the tight condition.\n\n          Transition:\n\n            If tight:\n                We have two choices:\n\n                  Choice 1: do not set the bit i.\n                      Then, the bit we set is 0.\n                      Then, the new tight condition: if m_bits[i] is 0, then we remain tight (because 0==0). If m_bits[i] is 1, then we set 0 and m_bits[i] is 1 -> now we are not tight.\n                      Then, the value for this choice is: 0 + dp[i+1][new_tight]\n\n                  Choice 2: set the bit i (only if m_bits[i] is 1 OR if we are not tight? Actually, in tight mode, if m_bits[i] is 1, we can set it, and then we remain tight. But if m_bits[i] is 0, we cannot set it (because then the number would exceed m).\n\n                      Then, the value is: a_i + dp[i+1][True]   (because we set the same as m, so we remain tight)\n\n            If not tight:\n                We can set the bit i arbitrarily. Since a_i>=0, we set it.\n\n                Then, the value is: a_i + dp[i+1][False]   (because we are still not tight)\n\n          However, note: the array a is given for bit0 to bit n-1. But the i-th bit in the DP is the i-th bit (which is the i-th element of the array a). \n\n          But wait, the array a is given as a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}. And the i-th bit (from our DP) is the i-th bit (which is the bit with weight 2^i). \n\n          So we use a[i] for the i-th bit.\n\n          But note: the DP state goes from i=0 to i=n-1. The array a is given as a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}. So we can index a by i.\n\n          However, the memory and time: n up to 10^5, and two states -> O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n          Base case: when i==n, return 0.\n\n          But wait: the problem says the array a has n elements, and the binary representation of m has n bits. So the bits go from 0 to n-1.\n\n          However, note: the function f(x) only considers bits that are set and the array a has exactly n elements (for bits 0 to n-1). \n\n          But what if n=10^5? Then we need to store two states for each bit. We can do iterative DP (since we only need the next state).\n\n          Steps for iterative DP:\n\n            dp0 = 0   # for i = n, we are done.\n            Then, we go from i = n-1 down to 0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do forward DP, but iterative from the least significant bit to the most.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end (inclusive) given the tight condition.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n            But wait, the bits are independent and we are building from low to high. The tight condition depends on the entire prefix.\n\n          Actually, we can do backward (from the most significant bit to the least) but the problem gives the bits in little-endian.\n\n          Alternatively, we can reverse the string and the array a? \n\n          However, note: the array a is given in the order of increasing bit index (a0 for bit0, a1 for bit1, ...). \n\n          The problem's representation of m is little-endian: the first character is bit0, then bit1, etc.\n\n          We can reverse both the array a and the string s to get big-endian? \n\n          But then the problem becomes:\n\n            Let a_big = a[::-1]   # now a_big[0] is a_{n-1} (the most significant bit) and a_big[i] is a_{n-1-i}\n            Let s_big = s[::-1]   # now s_big[0] is the (n-1)-th bit (most significant) and s_big[i] is the (n-1-i)-th bit.\n\n          Then, the constraint is: the number built (in big-endian) must be <= m.\n\n          Then we can do DP from the most significant bit to the least.\n\n          Steps for big-endian:\n\n            We have the bits from the most significant to the least.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n              If tight, then for the current bit (most significant first) we can set:\n\n                Option1: set the bit to 0.\n                  Then, if the current m_bit is 0, we remain tight. Otherwise, we become not tight.\n\n                Option2: set the bit to 1, but only if the current m_bit is 1 (if tight) or if not tight we can set it arbitrarily.\n\n            However, the benefit for setting a bit is a_big[i] (which is the original a_{n-1-i}), so we need to map the array a accordingly.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require the representation to be big-endian. The function f(x) is defined by the bits set, regardless of the representation.\n\n          So we can do either way.\n\n          Let's stick to little-endian (the given order) and do DP from i=0 to n-1.\n\n          However, note: the standard digit DP goes from high to low. But we can do from low to high if we define the state appropriately.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end.\n\n          But the tight condition: the bits from 0 to i-1 are fixed and equal to m's bits. Then for bit i, we have:\n\n            If tight, then we can set the bit to 0 or 1, but 1 is only allowed if m_bits[i] is 1.\n\n          However, the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m. When we are at bit i, the bits from 0 to i-1 are fixed. \n\n          The value of the bits from 0 to i-1 is already set. The condition for tight is that the bits from 0 to i-1 are exactly equal to m's bits from 0 to i-1.\n\n          Then, for bit i:\n\n            If tight:\n                The bits from 0 to i-1 are fixed and equal to m's. Then, the remaining bits (from i to n-1) must form a number that is <= the number formed by m's bits from i to n-1.\n\n                We can set the bit i to 0 or 1, but if we set it to 1, then we require that m_bits[i] is 1 (otherwise, the number would exceed m).\n\n                Then, the next state tight condition: \n                    If we set bit i to 0 and m_bits[i] is 0, then we remain tight (because the prefix is still matching).\n                    If we set bit i to 0 and m_bits[i] is 1, then we are no longer tight (because we set a 0 in a position where m has 1, so the prefix is less).\n                    If we set bit i to 1 and m_bits[i] is 1, then we remain tight.\n\n            If not tight:\n                Then the bits from 0 to i-1 are less than m's bits. Then, we can set the bit i arbitrarily (to 0 or 1). But since a_i>=0, we set it to 1 to get the a_i.\n\n          But wait, in the not tight state, we are free to set the bit arbitrarily, so we set it to 1 (and add a_i) and then the next state is still not tight.\n\n          However, we must consider: what if we set the bit to 0 in the not tight state? Then we don't get a_i, but we might set more bits above? But since we are not tight, we can set all the remaining bits arbitrarily (so we set all to 1). \n\n          Actually, the optimal choice in the not tight state is to set the bit to 1 if a_i>0, and to 0 otherwise. But note: a_i>=0, so we always set it to 1 (unless a_i==0, then it doesn't matter). However, if a_i==0, then setting the bit doesn't change the sum, so we can set it to 0 to save? Actually, no: because the constraint is satisfied and we are not tight, we can set the bit arbitrarily. But the goal is to maximize the sum. Setting a bit with a_i=0 doesn't help, so we can set it to 0. However, we are allowed to set it arbitrarily, so we can set it to 1 (which adds 0) or 0. So we can ignore it.\n\n          But note: the problem says a_i>=0, so we can set the bit arbitrarily. Since setting a bit with a_i=0 doesn't change the sum, we can set it to 0.\n\n          However, the above reasoning is not correct: the function f(x) is the sum of a_i for every set bit. So if we set a bit i that has a_i=0, we add 0. So it doesn't matter. We can set it arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, in the not tight state, we can set the bit i to 1 if a_i>0, and if a_i==0, we set it to 0. But wait, we want to maximize the sum. So we set it to 1 if a_i>0, and 0 if a_i==0.\n\n          However, we must design the DP to account for the possibility of setting a bit arbitrarily (without constraint) and maximizing the sum.\n\n          Alternatively, we can separate the problem:\n\n          In the not tight state, we can set all the remaining bits that have positive a_i. So the contribution from the not tight part is fixed: the sum of all a_j for j from i to n-1 that are positive.\n\n          But wait, what if we set a bit j (j>i) and that bit j has a_j>0? Then we must set it. So the entire not tight part is the sum of a_i (if we set it) plus the sum of all a_j (for j>i) that are positive.\n\n          However, the decision for the current bit i (in the not tight state) is independent: we set it if a_i>0, and then the rest we set arbitrarily (so we get the sum of all positive a_j for j>i).\n\n          Similarly, in the tight state, we have to consider the constraint.\n\n          Let's define:\n\n            Let S[i] = the sum of a_j for j from i to n-1 such that a_j>0.\n\n          Then, in the not tight state at bit i, we can get a_i (if positive) and then S[i+1] (the sum from i+1 to n-1 of positive a_j). \n\n          But wait, is that always optimal? Yes, because we are free to set all the remaining bits arbitrarily (so we set all positive ones).\n\n          Then, the DP state:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = \n              if tight:\n                  option1: do not set bit i -> then we remain tight only if m_bits[i]=='0', and we get dp[i+1][new_tight] (with new_tight = (tight and (0==m_bits[i]))\n                  option2: set bit i (only if m_bits[i]=='1') -> then we get a_i + dp[i+1][True] (because we set the same as m, so we remain tight)\n\n              else:\n                  We can set bit i to 1 if a_i>0, then we get a_i + S[i+1] (because the rest we set arbitrarily to get all positive a_j for j>=i+1) \n                  But wait, we can also set the bit i to 0 (if a_i==0, then we get 0 + S[i+1]). However, we are not tight, so we can set the rest arbitrarily.\n\n                  Actually, the optimal for the rest (from i to n-1) in the not tight state is: \n                    base = (a_i if a_i>0 else 0) + S[i+1]\n\n                  However, wait: the rest (from i+1 to n-1) is S[i+1] (by definition). And for bit i, we set it to 1 if a_i>0 (because then we add a_i) or leave it 0 (if a_i==0). \n\n                  But note: we are free to set the bits arbitrarily, so we set all the positive ones from i to n-1. \n\n                  So the total for the not tight state at bit",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the function \\( f(x) \\) depends on which bits are set in \\( x \\). The challenge is to select bits such that their corresponding array elements sum to the maximum possible value without exceeding the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves processing each bit from least significant to most significant (little-endian order) and deciding whether to set each bit based on whether it is allowed by the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\). The decision to set a bit depends on whether we are still \"tight\" to the constraint (i.e., the bits chosen so far match the corresponding bits in \\( m \\)) or if we have already chosen a bit that allows us to set subsequent bits freely.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum achievable from each bit onward, considering whether we are still tight to the constraint. For each bit:\n   - If tight, we can only set the bit if it is set in \\( m \\).\n   - If not tight, we can set the bit if its corresponding array element is positive.\n   \n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit exactly once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits. This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n\n    m_bits = list(s)\n    total_positive = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        total_positive[i] = total_positive[i + 1] + (a_list[i] if a_list[i] > 0 else 0)\n\n    dp_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_not_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        if i == n:\n            dp_tight[i] = 0\n            dp_not_tight[i] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        option_tight_set = -10**18\n        option_tight_not_set = -10**18\n        \n        if m_bits[i] == '1':\n            option_tight_set = a_list[i] + dp_tight[i + 1]\n        \n        new_tight_if_not_set = (m_bits[i] == '0')\n        option_tight_not_set = dp_tight[i + 1] if new_tight_if_not_set else dp_not_tight[i + 1]\n        \n        dp_tight[i] = max(option_tight_set, option_tight_not_set)\n        \n        option_not_tight = (a_list[i] if a_list[i] > 0 else 0) + total_positive[i + 1]\n        dp_not_tight[i] = option_not_tight\n    \n    ans = max(dp_tight[0], dp_not_tight[0])\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of bits \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Preprocessing**: We compute `total_positive`, an array where each element at index \\( i \\) stores the sum of all positive elements in \\( a \\) from index \\( i \\) to the end. This helps in quickly calculating the maximum possible sum when not constrained by \\( m \\).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We initialize two arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_not_tight`, to store the maximum sum achievable from each bit onward when we are still constrained by \\( m \\) or not, respectively.\n4. **Processing Bits**: For each bit from least significant to most significant:\n   - **Tight State**: If the bit in \\( m \\) is set, we can choose to set it (adding the corresponding array element) or not (remaining tight if the bit in \\( m \\) is not set). The maximum of these choices is stored in `dp_tight`.\n   - **Not Tight State**: Here, we can set any bit if its corresponding array element is positive, contributing to the sum. The total sum is the current bit's contribution plus the sum of all positive elements in subsequent bits.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value between the tight and not tight states at the first bit (least significant), printed as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints and maximizes the function value by leveraging dynamic programming and preprocessing to handle large input sizes.",
