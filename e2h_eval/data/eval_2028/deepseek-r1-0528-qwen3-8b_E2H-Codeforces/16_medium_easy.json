Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border (of nonzero length). \n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing one or more roads. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n We start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (but note: moving from one block to another requires crossing a contiguous segment of a road, i.e., one road at a time). However, if we cross multiple roads at an intersection, then we might be crossing several roads at once? But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (so they are separated by exactly one road). Therefore, to go from one block to another, we must cross one road (and we can do so in one step). But note: what if two blocks are separated by two roads? Then we cannot go directly, but we must go through an intermediate block.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to count the number of roads crossed, but the minimum number of steps. Each step is crossing one road (because each adjacent block is separated by one road). But wait, actually, when we cross one road, we move from one block to an adjacent one. So the minimum number of steps is the minimum number of road crossings required to go from home to university.\n\n But observe: the roads divide the plane. The home and university are in two different regions. The minimal number of road crossings is the same as the minimal number of lines that separate the two points? Not exactly: because we are allowed to cross one road per step, and we can choose the order arbitrarily, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed to get from home to university.\n\n However, note: the roads are linear and the entire plane is divided. The two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a set of roads. For each road, we can determine whether the home and the university are on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road. If they are on the same side, then we don't have to cross it.\n\n But wait: is the minimal number of steps just the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides? \n\n Example: \n  Input 1: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n  These two roads are the vertical line x=0 and the horizontal line y=0.\n  The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant, and the university (-1,-1) is in the third quadrant.\n  They are separated by both lines. So the minimal steps would be 2.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input 2:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n  Here, the third road is x+y-3=0. Let's check the two points:\n      For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n      For university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n\n  So the third road does not separate them. Therefore, only the two other roads matter, so again 2 steps.\n\n However, note: there might be a possibility that we can cross the roads in any order, but the minimal number of crossings is the number of separating lines. Because if we have k roads that separate the two points, then we must cross each of them at least once. And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal steps is k.\n\n But wait: what if a road separates the two points, but we can cross multiple roads in one step? The problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that if two blocks share a common segment (which is part of one road), then one step suffices to cross that one road. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads in one step. So the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads to cross, which is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: the two points may lie in a region that is separated by multiple roads. But the entire journey requires crossing every road that separates them. But note: the problem does not say that we must cross each separating road exactly once. In fact, we can only cross a road once (since we are going from one side to the other). So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n How to compute for a given road (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0) whether the two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are on opposite sides?\n\n We can evaluate the sign of:\n   f1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n   f2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\n If f1 and f2 have opposite signs (i.e., one positive and the other negative) then the road separates the two points.\n\n However, note: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple (since the line equation is homogeneous). But the sign is well-defined because we are only comparing the two points.\n\n But caution: the equation could be multiplied by -1. Then the signs of f1 and f2 would flip. However, we only care about the relative signs (opposite vs same). So if we define:\n   sign1 = 1 if f1 > 0, -1 if f1 < 0, and 0 if f1==0 (but the problem guarantees that the points are not on the road, so no zeros).\n   Similarly for sign2.\n\n Then we check if sign1 != sign2.\n\n Alternatively, we can check: if f1 * f2 < 0 then they are on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: the value of f1 and f2 can be very large, but we are only interested in the sign. Since we are guaranteed that the points are not on the road, we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Read home (x1, y1)\n  2. Read university (x2, y2)\n  3. Read n\n  4. For each of the n roads (each has a, b, c):\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            then this road separates the two points.\n\n  5. Count the number of such roads.\n\n  6. Print the count.\n\n But wait: is that really the minimal number of steps? \n\n Let me think with an example: \n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), and two roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n\n   For Road1: \n        f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n   For Road2:\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n   Count = 2 -> answer 2.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   For the third road: 1*x + 1*y -3 =0\n        f1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n        f2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same sign, so doesn't separate.\n\n   Then the answer is 2.\n\n What if the two points are already in the same block? Then we output 0.\n\n Example: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (2,2), and one road: x+y-3=0.\n        Check the road: \n          f1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n          f2 = 2+2-3 = 1 -> positive -> separates -> steps=1.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so they are either on the same side or opposite.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the university is located in a block (so not on a road). \n\n So the algorithm is:\n\n   steps = 0\n   for each road (a, b, c):\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, we know f1 != 0 and f2 != 0.\n\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 >= 0) or (f1 >= 0 and f2 < 0):\n            Actually, we need to check for opposite signs. But note: because the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple, we cannot rely on the absolute values. However, the sign comparison is independent of the magnitude.\n\n        But note: if we multiply the equation by -1, then the signs flip. However, the condition (f1 * f2 < 0) is invariant under flipping the sign of the entire equation? \n\n        Let me check: \n            Original: f1 = a*x1+b*y1+c, f2 = a*x2+b*y2+c\n            Multiply equation by -1: new equation: -a*x -b*y -c =0, then new_f1 = -f1, new_f2 = -f2.\n            Then (new_f1 * new_f2) = (-f1)*(-f2) = f1*f2. So the product is the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can use: \n            if f1 * f2 < 0:\n                steps += 1\n\n   Then output steps.\n\n However, note: the multiplication might cause overflow? The numbers can be as large as 10^6, and n up to 300, so a*x1 can be up to 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and then multiplied by 300 is 3e14, which is acceptable in Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are doing integer arithmetic and the product is 3e14 which is within the range of integers).\n\n But wait: the problem says the coefficients and coordinates are integers between -10^6 and 10^6. So the maximum absolute value of f1 is |a*x1+b*y1+c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c| <= 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6 ~ 2e12, which is still an integer that Python handles.\n\n However, we can also avoid the multiplication by checking the signs without multiplying (to avoid creating a huge product, though 2e12 is acceptable, but let's do it by sign comparison):\n\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            steps += 1\n\n But note: what if the equation is multiplied by a negative factor? Then the signs of f1 and f2 would flip, but the condition (one positive and one negative) remains the same. However, the above condition uses the actual computed signs. Since the equation is defined by the input, we use the given a, b, c.\n\n But wait: the equation is given as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. The input gives the equation in that form. So we don't change the equation.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the sign of the equation. So we should use the given equation.\n\n But note: the condition (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) OR (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) is the same as (f1 * f2 < 0). \n\n However, using the product might be more straightforward and we are guaranteed that the product is negative if and only if the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But there is one caveat: what if one of the evaluations is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n However, let me check: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\" So we know f1 != 0 and f2 != 0.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two points are on opposite sides of the line\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: is that really the minimal steps? \n\n Consider: the movement is defined by crossing roads. Each crossing moves from one block to an adjacent one. The minimal steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross. And that is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the blocks are separated by the roads. The entire plane is partitioned by the arrangement of the n roads. The minimal steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross to get from the home block to the university block.\n\n This is analogous to the problem of determining the minimal number of hyperplanes (or lines) that separate two points in an arrangement. And indeed, the answer is the number of hyperplanes (lines) that strictly separate the two points.\n\n However, there is an important point: the arrangement of lines might create a situation where the two points are separated by a set of lines, and we must cross each of them. But note: we can choose the order arbitrarily, and the minimal steps is the total number of separating lines.\n\n Example: \n   Two points and three lines. Suppose two lines separate them and one doesn't. Then the answer is 2.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by two lines, but the two lines are arranged such that there is a path that avoids crossing one of them? No, because the two points are on opposite sides of that line, so we must cross that line. Similarly for the other.\n\n Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n However, let's consider a more complex example:\n\n   Home: (0,0) and University: (2,2)\n   Roads: \n        Line1: x=1 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1\n        Line2: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0\n        Line3: y=1 -> a=0, b=1, c=-1\n\n   Check Line1: \n        f1 = 1*0 + 0*0 -1 = -1 -> negative\n        f2 = 1*2 + 0*2 -1 = 1 -> positive -> separates.\n\n   Line2:\n        f1 = 1*0+0*0+0 = 0 -> wait, but the problem says the points are not on the road. So let me adjust: \n        Actually, the problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\". So we cannot have Line2 passing through (0,0) or (2,2). \n\n   Let me choose different example:\n\n   Home: (0,0), University: (2,2)\n   Roads: \n        Line1: x=1 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1\n        Line2: y=1 -> a=0, b=1, c=-1\n        Line3: x+y=2 -> a=1, b=1, c=-2\n\n   Now, check:\n        Line1: \n            f1 = 1*0+0*0-1 = -1 -> negative\n            f2 = 1*2+0*2-1 = 1 -> positive -> separates.\n\n        Line2:\n            f1 = 0*0+1*0-1 = -1 -> negative\n            f2 = 0*2+1*2-1 = 1 -> positive -> separates.\n\n        Line3:\n            f1 = 1*0+1*0-2 = -2 -> negative\n            f2 = 1*2+1*2-2 = 2 -> positive -> separates.\n\n        Answer = 3.\n\n   Now, how many steps? We must cross all three lines. But note: the two points are in the region where x<1, y<1, and x+y<2. The university is in the region x>=1, y>=1, and x+y>=2? Actually, the university (2,2) is in the region x>=1, y>=2 (so y>=1) and x+y>=4 (which is >=2). So yes, we must cross all three.\n\n   However, is there a way to cross the three lines in 3 steps? Yes. But can we do it in less? No, because we must cross each line at least once.\n\n   Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n But wait: what if a road equation is given with negative leading coefficient? \n\n Example: \n        Line: x=1 is given as -1*x + 0*y + 1 = 0 -> then a=-1, b=0, c=1.\n\n        For home (0,0): f1 = -1*0 + 0*0 + 1 = 1 -> positive\n        For university (2,2): f2 = -1*2 + 0*2 + 1 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Condition: (positive and negative) -> true.\n\n   So the condition (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) holds.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the product method:\n\n        f1 * f2 = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0 -> true.\n\n   So both methods are consistent.\n\n However, note: the product method might face overflow issues with very large numbers, but the problem constraints (numbers up to 10^6) and n up to 300, and the product being up to (2e12) * (2e12) = 4e24, which is an integer that Python can handle (though it's big, but the product of two 2e12 is 4e24, and 4e24 is still a fixed-precision integer in Python? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, so there is no overflow in terms of value, but performance might be an issue for 300 such operations? But 300 * (two multiplications of 12-digit numbers) is acceptable.\n\n But since the problem constraints are not too high, and we are only doing 300 lines, we can use the product method or the sign method. The sign method avoids the large product, but we are doing two multiplications (for the product) or four comparisons (for the sign) and the sign method is safe.\n\n However, there is a potential pitfall: the sign method requires knowing the sign of two potentially very large numbers. But since the numbers are integers, the sign is well-defined.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the equations are given with integers, so the evaluations are integers.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Evaluate the two points\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, neither val1 nor val2 is zero.\n        if val1 == 0 or val2 == 0:\n            # According to the problem guarantee, this should not happen.\n            # But let's skip or not? The problem says guaranteed not on the road, so we can ignore.\n            # But to be safe, we don't count this road? Actually, the condition is opposite sides, so if one is zero then the point is on the road, which is not allowed. So we skip counting for roads that have a point on them? But the problem says none of the points are on the road, so we assume no zeros.\n            # So we don't expect zeros. We'll proceed with the condition.\n            pass\n\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: what if the equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? The condition still holds because we are only looking at the sign.\n\n Let me test with a negative equation:\n\n        Equation: -x - y + 3 = 0 (which is the same as x+y=3, but written negatively)\n        Home: (1,1): val1 = -1-1+3 = 1 -> positive\n        University: (2,2): val2 = -2-2+3 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Condition: positive and negative -> true.\n\n        Equation: x+y-3=0 (positive form)\n        Home: (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n        University: (2,2): 2+2-3 = 1 -> positive -> separates.\n\n        Condition: negative and positive -> true.\n\n So the condition is symmetric.\n\n But note: what if one evaluation is positive and the other negative, but due to the equation being defined with negative coefficients, the condition is the same.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, the problem statement example outputs:\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Our code for example1:\n\n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> equation: y=0\n            val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> equation: x=0\n            val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Count = 2.\n\n Example2:\n\n        Road1: 1 0 0 -> x=0\n            val1 = 1*1+0+0 = 1 -> positive\n            val2 = 1*(-1)+0+0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Road2: 0 1 0 -> y=0\n            val1 = 0+1*1+0 = 1 -> positive\n            val2 = 0+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n        Road3: 1 1 -3\n            val1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n            val2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same side.\n\n        Count = 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example inputs are given as strings in a list. But the input is read from stdin.\n\n Final code:\n\n   Read two integers for home.\n   Read two integers for university.\n   Read integer n.\n   For n times, read three integers for the road.\n\n   Then, for each road, compute the two values and check the signs.\n\n   Output the count.\n\n But note: the input format is:\n\n        First line: x1 y1\n        Second line: x2 y2\n        Third line: n\n        Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n However, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n But note: the problem reads from stdin, so we assume the input is given via standard input.\n\n We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n One more corner case: when n=0.\n\n        Then no roads. Then the two points are in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road -> 0 steps.\n\n        Example: \n            Input:\n                1 1\n                1 1\n                0\n\n            Then we output 0.\n\n        But wait, if the two points are the same, then they are in the same block. However, the problem does not guarantee that the home and university are distinct. But the problem says \"Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block.\" and \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\". \n\n        However, if the two points are distinct, then we must check the roads. But if n=0, then no roads, so the entire plane is one block. Then we don't need to cross any road.\n\n        But if the two points are distinct and there are no roads, then they are in the same block, so steps=0.\n\n        The code will output 0.\n\n        Also, if the two points are the same and there are roads, then we don't have to cross any road (they are in the same block) so 0.\n\n        Example: \n            Input:\n                1 1\n                1 1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Then the two points are (1,1) and (1,1). For each road, we evaluate the same point twice.\n\n            For Road1: y=0 -> (1,1): 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 -> positive; same for the second point -> positive. Same side -> not separated.\n\n            For Road2: x=0 -> (1,1): 1*1+0+0=1 -> positive; same for the second -> positive. Same side.\n\n            Count=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are defined by the equation a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and the coefficients are integers. We are using integer arithmetic.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   steps = 0\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Calculate the value for home and university\n        home_val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        uni_val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, we know home_val and uni_val are not zero.\n        # Check if they are on opposite sides.\n        if home_val * uni_val < 0:\n            steps += 1\n\n   print(steps)\n\n But wait: the product method might be slightly faster and more concise.\n\n However, the product method uses multiplication, which might be slower than the sign comparison? But the numbers are integers and the multiplication is cheap.\n\n But note: the product might be negative even if one of them is zero? No, because the points are not on the road, so we know they are not zero. However, we are not checking for zero in the product method. \n\n We can also do:\n\n        if home_val < 0 and uni_val > 0:\n            steps += 1\n        elif home_val > 0 and uni_val < 0:\n            steps += 1\n\n This avoids the multiplication. \n\n However, the problem says the numbers can be as large as 2e12, and we are only doing 300 of these, so the product is acceptable.\n\n But let me use the product method because it's one condition and short.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the product of two very large numbers (each up to 2e12) is 4e24, which is a big integer. But 300 big integers is acceptable in Python.\n\n But the sign method avoids the big integer multiplication. However, the sign method requires two multiplications (the same two) and then two comparisons, but the comparisons are on two numbers that are already computed.\n\n Actually, the product method is:\n\n        temp1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c   [integer]\n        temp2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c   [integer]\n        if temp1 * temp2 < 0: ...\n\n The sign method is:\n\n        if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 0) or (temp1 > 0 and temp2 < 0): ...\n\n Both require two multiplications (the two products) and then one condition. But the product method computes the product which is a big integer, while the sign method does two comparisons.\n\n But note: the product method does not require storing two temporary variables (if we use the product method, we have to store the two values anyway). \n\n Actually, we must store the two values because we need them for the condition.\n\n I think either is acceptable.\n\n Let me use the product method for simplicity.\n\n However, wait: the product of two numbers that are up to 2e12 (absolute value) is 4e24, which is a very big number, but Python can handle it. But if we are concerned about performance, the sign method might be faster because it avoids the big multiplication.\n\n But 300 iterations of big integer multiplication (each 4e24) might be acceptable in modern computers? It's only 300, and the numbers are not that big (4e24 has about 80 bits, which is acceptable). But let's use the sign method for safety and to avoid very big numbers.\n\n Actually, the sign method is:\n\n        if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 0) or (temp1 > 0 and temp2 < 0):\n\n But note: we must compute temp1 and temp2 anyway.\n\n Let me write the sign method version.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        temp1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        temp2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Since the points are not on the road, we know temp1 and temp2 are not zero.\n        if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 0) or (temp1 > 0 and temp2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n I think this is clear and efficient.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example1: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=2, roads: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]\n\n        Road1: [0,1,0]\n            temp1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            temp2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> condition holds (positive and negative)\n\n        Road2: [1,0,0]\n            temp1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            temp2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> condition holds.\n\n        Count=2.\n\n Example2: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=3, roads: [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,-3]\n\n        Road1: [1,0,0] -> (1,1) -> 1, (-1,-1) -> -1 -> condition holds.\n        Road2: [0,1,0] -> (1,1) -> 1, (-1,-1) -> -1 -> condition holds.\n        Road3: [1,1,-3] -> (1,1) -> 1+1-3 = -1, (-1,-1) -> -1-1-3 = -5 -> both negative -> condition fails.\n\n        Count=2.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the product method might be simpler and equally valid. But the sign method is also clear.\n\n We'll use the sign method.\n\n But wait: what if the equation is defined with negative leading coefficient? The condition still holds as shown earlier.\n\n So the code is ready.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n Note: the problem says the input is from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        temp1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        temp2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 0) or (temp1 > 0 and temp2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient and the product is negative? The sign method works because we are checking the sign independently.\n\n Example: equation: -x - y + 3 = 0 (same as x+y=3 but negative)\n   Home: (1,1): temp1 = -1-1+3 = 1 -> positive\n   University: (2,2): temp2 = -2-2+3 = -1 -> negative -> condition holds.\n\n   Equation: x+y=3 (positive form)\n   Home: (1,1): temp1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n   University: (2,2): temp2 = 2+2-3 = 1 -> positive -> condition holds.\n\n So the condition is symmetric.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are defined by the equation a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and the coefficients are integers. The sign method works.\n\n We'll run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n           1 1\n           -1 -1\n           2\n           0 1 0\n           1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n           1 1\n           -1 -1\n           3\n           1 0 0\n           0 1 0\n           1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 3: \n        Input: \n           0 0\n           2 2\n           3\n           1 0 -1\n           0 1 -1\n           1 1 -2\n\n        Output: 3\n\n Example 4: \n        Input: \n           0 0\n           0 0\n           2\n           1 0 0\n           0 1 0\n\n        Output: 0\n\n Example 5:\n        Input:\n           0 0\n           1 0\n           1\n           1 0 -1\n\n        Road: x=1, home (0,0)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road must be crossed if the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed once. The minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. This is done by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a_i \\cdot x + b_i \\cdot y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each road, computing the expression value for both points, and checking if the signs of these values are opposite. If they are, we increment our step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        temp1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        temp2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (temp1 < 0 and temp2 > 0) or (temp1 > 0 and temp2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the coordinates of the home, followed by the university's coordinates. The next value is the number of roads, \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The expression \\(a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y + c\\) is evaluated for both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the evaluated expressions for the two points have opposite signs, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of roads separating the home and university is printed, which directly gives the minimal number of steps required to reach the university.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with a linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
