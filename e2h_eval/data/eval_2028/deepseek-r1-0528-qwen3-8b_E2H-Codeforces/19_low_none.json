The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. The president wants to remove k contestants (so we keep n-k districts). The condition is that the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph (since there's exactly one path between every two, and we cannot cross removed districts). Also, we wish to maximize the total number of fans, which is 2^i for a contestant from district i.\n\n Note: Since the value 2^i grows exponentially, we want to keep the districts with the highest fan counts. However, the constraint is connectivity.\n\n Observation:\n In any connected subgraph (which is a tree) of the original tree, the kept nodes must form a connected component. But note: the entire graph is a tree, so the kept nodes must form a connected subtree (i.e., a set of nodes such that the induced subgraph is connected).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the kept contestants to form a spanning tree or anything; just that they form a connected component. But note: the removal of k nodes from a tree leaves a forest? Actually, the condition is that the remaining districts must be reachable from each other. So the remaining set must be connected.\n\n But note: the original graph is a tree, so the remaining set must form a connected subtree (which is also a tree). \n\n How do we choose the maximum total fans? Since 2^i is increasing with i, we would like to keep the largest numbered districts as much as possible. However, we must ensure connectivity.\n\n However, note that the districts are numbered arbitrarily (the input tree doesn't have the numbers in order). But the fan count is determined by the district number (2^district_number). Therefore, we definitely want to keep the districts with the largest numbers, but sometimes we have to remove a district to break the graph into pieces and then we might be forced to remove even more? Actually, we are going to remove k districts and leave n-k.\n\n We are to output the k smallest-numbered districts that should be removed (because the problem says: \"Print k space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\") \n\n Alternatively, we can think: which n-k districts to keep? We want to keep the ones with the highest fan counts (i.e., the highest district numbers) as long as they form a connected subgraph.\n\n But note: the districts are connected by a tree. The problem is equivalent to: remove k districts (so we keep n-k) such that the kept set is connected and has the maximum total fan count.\n\n However, note: the fan count is 2^i, and 2^i is exponential. Therefore, keeping a higher-numbered district gives more fans than keeping multiple lower-numbered ones. In fact, 2^6 > 2^5 + 2^5 + ... (in fact, 2^i is more than the sum of all 2^j for j from 0 to i-1). So we definitely want to keep the highest-numbered districts.\n\n But wait: what if the highest-numbered district is a leaf? Then to keep it we must keep the entire path from that leaf to some central part? Actually, we are allowed to remove any k, and the kept set must be connected. The optimal solution is to keep the largest (by district number) districts that form a connected subgraph.\n\n However, note: the connectivity condition requires that the kept districts form a connected subgraph. The largest districts (by number) are at the periphery. But if we take a set of large-numbered districts, they might be disconnected.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider: we are to remove k districts. We want to keep the largest n-k districts (by fan count, i.e., by district number) that form a connected subgraph. But note: if we simply keep the n-k largest districts, they might not be connected.\n\n How to check if a set of nodes (the largest n-k districts) is connected? And if not, which ones to remove instead?\n\n Alternatively, think about the following: we must keep a connected subgraph. The best candidate for the connected subgraph is the set of the largest districts that includes a connected set. But note: the entire set of the largest districts might not be connected.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n 1. The fan count is determined solely by the district number (larger number -> more fans). So we want to keep the largest districts (by number) as much as possible.\n\n 2. However, we cannot drop a district that is necessary to connect the larger districts.\n\n 3. We can consider: if we are to keep a set S of districts, then the induced subgraph must be connected.\n\n 4. We can try to build a connected subgraph by starting from the largest district and then including as many large districts as possible.\n\n But note: the problem asks to output",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph and the total number of fans from the remaining districts is maximized. The key observation here is that the fan count for a district is \\(2^i\\), which grows exponentially with the district number. Therefore, to maximize the total fan count, we should prioritize keeping the districts with the highest numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node represents a district. The goal is to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree and the sum of \\(2^i\\) for the remaining nodes is maximized.\n2. **Intuition**: Since \\(2^i\\) grows exponentially, higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan count. Thus, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they form a connected subgraph.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Tree Traversal**: We use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to process nodes in descending order of their numbers. This allows us to consider higher-numbered districts first.\n   - **Connectivity Check**: For each district, we check if removing it would disconnect the higher-numbered districts. If it does, we must keep this district to maintain connectivity.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each node once during the DFS traversal, leading to an O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    order = [0] * (n+1)\n    parent = [0] * (n+1)\n    children_count = [0] * (n+1)\n    stack = [1]\n    parent[1] = 0\n    while stack:\n        node = stack.pop()\n        order[node] = len(graph[node])\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            parent[neighbor] = node\n            children_count[node] += 1\n            stack.append(neighbor)\n    \n    leaves = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if children_count[i] == 0 and order[i] > 1:\n            leaves.append(i)\n    \n    leaves.sort(reverse=True)\n    to_remove = []\n    visited = set()\n    for leaf in leaves:\n        if len(to_remove) == k:\n            break\n        if leaf not in visited:\n            q = deque([leaf])\n            visited.add(leaf)\n            to_remove.append(leaf)\n            while q:\n                node = q.popleft()\n                for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                    if neighbor not in visited:\n                        visited.add(neighbor)\n                        to_remove.append(neighbor)\n                        q.append(neighbor)\n    \n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, to_remove[:k])))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k). The tree structure is built using an adjacency list.\n2. **Tree Processing**: A DFS is performed starting from district 1 to compute the parent-child relationships and the number of children for each node. This helps in identifying leaves (nodes with no children).\n3. **Leaf Processing**: The leaves are sorted in descending order to prioritize removing higher-numbered districts first.\n4. **Removal Strategy**: For each leaf, if it hasn't been visited, its entire subtree is marked for removal. This ensures that higher-numbered districts are removed first while maintaining connectivity among the remaining districts.\n5. **Output**: The k smallest-numbered districts to remove are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph with the maximum possible fan count by leveraging tree traversal and strategic removal of higher-numbered leaves first.",
