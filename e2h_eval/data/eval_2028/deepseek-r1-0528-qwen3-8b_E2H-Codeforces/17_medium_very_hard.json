He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2*n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string s of length n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent\".\n\n Observation:\n Let the true string be s of length n.\n\n Then, for a given length L (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings provided: one is s[0:L] (prefix) and the other is s[n-L:n] (suffix).\n\n However, note: the problem does not tell us which is which. Moreover, the two strings for a fixed L might be different.\n\n How can we assign?\n\n Important: The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with one string s.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n 2. We can group the strings by their lengths. For each length L (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings.\n\n 3. Now, consider: the entire string s must have these two strings as one being the prefix and the other being the suffix.\n\n 4. However, note: the condition of consistency is that if we assign a string as a prefix for length L, then it must equal s[0:L]. Similarly, if we assign a string as a suffix for length L, then it must equal s[n-L:n].\n\n 5. Also note: the longer prefixes/suffixes contain information about the shorter ones. For example, if we have the full string s, then the prefix of length 1 is the first character, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character. Moreover, the prefix of length 2 is the first two characters, and so on.\n\n 6. Alternate approach: Since n is at most 100, but the total number of strings is 2*(n-1) (which is at most 198), we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n 7. Another idea: the problem states that the set of strings is the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n. So, we can try to reconstruct the string s by aligning the prefixes and suffixes.\n\n 8. We know the two strings for each length. Let's denote by P_L and S_L the two strings of length L.\n\n 9. Now, if we assume that the two strings for length L are the prefix and the suffix, then note that if we look at the next larger length (L+1) then the prefix of length L+1 must start with the prefix of length L. Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 must end with the suffix of length L.\n\n 10. However, we don't know which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix for each length.\n\n 11. We can use the following:\n\n     Let F be the set of all strings.\n\n     We can try to find the longest string that can be the entire string? Actually, we don't have a string of length n.\n\n 12. But note: the problem says that the set of strings are the proper prefixes and suffixes (so no string of length n is provided).\n\n 13. However, we can use the fact that the entire string s must be such that for every L from 1 to n-1, the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n 14. How about this: let's consider the two candidates for the entire string? Actually, the entire string s is not given. But note: the two strings of length n-1 must be the prefix and the suffix of s. Therefore, the entire string s must be the concatenation of the two n-1 strings? Not exactly, because the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 characters and the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters. Then the entire string s would be: [prefix of length n-1] + [last character] OR [first character] + [suffix of length n-1]? Actually, the two n-1 strings are not necessarily overlapping in the same way.\n\n 15. Example: n=5, then the two strings of length 4 are the prefix and suffix. The entire string has length 5. The prefix is s[0:4] and the suffix is s[1:5]. Then the entire string must be s[0:4] + s[4] (but wait, the suffix is s[1:5] = s[1:4+1] = s[1:5] so the last character is s[4] and the first character is s[0]. Then the entire string is s[0] and then the suffix of length 4 is s[1:5]. So the entire string is s[0] + s[1:5] (without repeating s[0] because the suffix of length 4 doesn't include the first character). \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can note: the entire string s must satisfy that for each L, the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must be aligned appropriately.\n\n 17. Another idea: since the problem says that there is at least one string consistent, we can try to determine the assignment by looking at overlaps.\n\n 18. Consider: the two strings of length 1: say they are \"a\" and \"b\". Then the entire string must start with one of them and end with the other. Then for length 2: we have two strings, say \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", etc. But we know that the prefix of length 2 is the two starting letters, and the suffix of length 2 is the two ending letters.\n\n 19. However, the problem becomes: we have to assign each string (at each length) to either prefix or suffix.\n\n 20. Constraints: \n     - The set of prefixes must form a sequence: p1, p2, ... p_{n-1} such that p_i is the first i characters and p_{i+1} must start with p_i.\n     - Similarly, the set of suffixes must form a sequence: s1, s2, ... s_{n-1} such that s_{i+1} must end with s_i.\n\n 21. But note: we don't know the ordering of the lengths. We know the two strings per length.\n\n 22. Steps:\n\n     a. Group the strings by length.\n\n     b. We have to assign each group (for a given length L) to either 'P' or 'S'. But note: the assignment must be consistent with the entire string.\n\n     c. We can use the following: for two consecutive lengths, say L and L+1, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of the prefix of length L+1. Similarly, the suffix of length L must be the suffix of the suffix of length L+1.\n\n     d. However, we don't know the order of the lengths in the input.\n\n 23. Alternative Insight:\n\n     Since the entire string s is fixed, the two strings of length L must be the prefix and the suffix. Then, for two different lengths, the two strings of length L and the two strings of length L' (with L != L') are independent in terms of the entire string.\n\n 24. But wait, the entire string s must be consistent. For example, the prefix of length 1 must be the first character of the prefix of length 2. Similarly, the suffix of length 1 must be the last character of the suffix of length 2.\n\n 25. Therefore, we can do:\n\n     Step 1: For each length L (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings: A and B.\n\n     Step 2: We need to decide which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix.\n\n     Step 3: We can use the following rule: the entire string s must be such that the prefix of length L is a prefix of the prefix of length L+1, and the suffix of length L is a suffix of the suffix of length L+1.\n\n 26. However, we don't know the entire string, but we can use the fact that the entire set of prefixes must form a chain and the entire set of suffixes must form a chain.\n\n 27. We can try to build two chains: one for prefixes and one for suffixes.\n\n     Let the prefix chain: \n        p1, p2, ..., p_{n-1}\n        Conditions: p_i is a prefix of p_{i+1} (so p_{i+1} starts with p_i)\n\n     Similarly, the suffix chain:\n        s1, s2, ..., s_{n-1}\n        Conditions: s_{i+1} ends with s_i.\n\n 28. Now, for each length L, we have two candidates: one goes to the prefix chain and the other to the suffix chain.\n\n 29. How to decide?\n\n     We can consider the two strings of length L and see which one fits better with the chain.\n\n     But note: we don't know the entire chain, but we can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent.\n\n 30. Another idea: the entire string s must be of length n. Then, the two strings of length L must be the prefix and the suffix. Moreover, the two strings of length L must be such that the prefix of length L is the first L characters, and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n     Now, consider two consecutive lengths: L and L+1.\n\n     The prefix of length L+1 must be the first L+1 characters. Then, the first L characters of the prefix of length L+1 must be the prefix of length L.\n\n     Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 must end with the suffix of length L.\n\n 31. Therefore, if we fix the assignment for length L and L+1, we can check consistency.\n\n 32. Since n is at most 100, but the total number of strings is only 2*(n-1) (at most 198), and the lengths go from 1 to n-1 (max 99), we can try to assign each length independently? But the assignments are interdependent.\n\n 33. We can use a bipartite graph for the entire set? Actually, we have to assign each string to either P or S, but with the constraint that for each length, one is P and one is S.\n\n 34. Then, we can also have constraints between adjacent lengths. Specifically, if we assign a particular string as the prefix for length L, then the two strings of length L+1 must be such that one of them (the prefix) must start with that string.\n\n 35. However, the problem says that we can output any valid answer.\n\n 36. Let me think of a simpler method:\n\n     Consider the entire string s. Then, the two strings of length 1 must be the first character and the last character. Similarly, the two strings of length 2 must be the first two and the last two.\n\n     Now, the entire string s must be such that the first character is the first character of the prefix of length 2, and the last character is the last character of the suffix of length 2.\n\n     But note: the two strings of length 1: one is the first character, the other is the last character.\n\n     Then, for the two strings of length 2, we have:\n        One is the prefix: which is (first character) + (second character)\n        The other is the suffix: which is (n-2-th character) + (last character)\n\n     And note: the first character is known from the length-1 prefix candidate, and the last character from the length-1 suffix candidate.\n\n     However, we don't know which of the two length-1 strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n 37. We can use the following:\n\n     Let the two strings of length 1 be x and y.\n\n     Then, the entire string s must start with either x or y and end with the other.\n\n     Now, consider the two strings of length 2: say ab and cd.\n\n     If we assume that the first character is x and the last character is y, then the prefix of length 2 must be (x + something). So the prefix of length 2 must start with x. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with y.\n\n     Then, we can assign:\n\n        For length 1: \n            if x is assigned as prefix, then the prefix chain starts with x, and then the prefix of length 2 must start with x.\n            if x is assigned as suffix, then the suffix chain ends with x, and then the suffix of length 2 must end with x.\n\n        But wait, we have two length-1 strings: x and y.\n\n        We have two possibilities:\n\n          Possibility 1: \n             prefix of length 1: x, suffix of length 1: y.\n\n          Possibility 2:\n             prefix of length 1: y, suffix of length 1: x.\n\n     Then, for the length-2 strings, we must check:\n\n        Possibility 1: \n            The prefix of length 2 must be a string that starts with x. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with y.\n\n        Possibility 2:\n            The prefix of length 2 must be a string that starts with y. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with x.\n\n     Then, we choose the possibility that satisfies the condition for the length-2 strings.\n\n     But note: we don't know the entire string, but we know the set of two strings for each length.\n\n     However, the problem says: the set of strings is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of some string s. So if one of the possibilities works, we choose it.\n\n 38. Algorithm:\n\n     Step 1: Read n and the list of strings.\n\n     Step 2: Group the strings by their lengths.\n\n        groups = {}\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            groups[l] = []   # will have two strings\n\n        for each string in the input:\n            l = len(string)\n            groups[l].append(string)\n\n     Step 3: We have to assign each group (for each length) to either P or S.\n\n     Step 4: How to assign?\n\n        We can start from the smallest length (1) and then move to larger ones.\n\n        Let's define:\n            prefix_chain: dictionary for the prefix string for each length (if we assign as prefix) OR we don't know the chain until we assign.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        We know that the entire string s must be consistent. We can try to build the two chains independently.\n\n        However, note: we don't know the entire string, but we can use the fact that the set of prefixes must form a chain and the set of suffixes must form a chain.\n\n        Steps for assignment:\n\n          We'll process from length 1 to n-1.\n\n          At length 1: we have two strings, say a and b.\n\n          We have two possibilities: \n            Option 1: assign a as prefix and b as suffix.\n            Option 2: assign b as prefix and a as suffix.\n\n          Then, for length 2: we have two strings, say c and d.\n\n          For Option 1:\n            The prefix of length 2 must start with a, and the suffix of length 2 must end with b.\n\n          Then, check if one of the two strings of length 2 starts with a and the other ends with b.\n\n          Similarly for Option 2.\n\n          Then, we choose the option that matches.\n\n          Then, for length 3: \n            The prefix of length 3 must start with the prefix of length 2 (which we now know) and the suffix of length 3 must end with the suffix of length 2.\n\n          And so on.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire chain to be built from the beginning. It just requires that the assignment is consistent.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          For length 1, try both possibilities and see which one leads to a consistent assignment for the entire set.\n\n        But worst-case, we have two choices for each length, and there are n-1 lengths -> 2^(n-1) possibilities. Since n<=100, that is too many.\n\n 39. We need a smarter way.\n\n 40. Another idea: since the entire string s is fixed, the two strings of length L must be the prefix and the suffix. Then, for two different lengths, the two strings of length L and the two strings of length L' (with L < L') must satisfy:\n\n        The prefix of length L is a prefix of the prefix of length L'.\n        The suffix of length L is a suffix of the suffix of length L'.\n\n 41. But note: we don't know which is which.\n\n 42. We can try to assign the two strings of each length arbitrarily and then check the consistency with the next length.\n\n     However, we can also note: the entire set of prefixes must be a set of strings that are increasing in length and the prefix condition holds. Similarly for suffixes.\n\n     Since the two strings for each length are distinct? The problem does not say they are distinct. But note: the example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" has two 'aa' and two 'a'. \n\n     Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\". So the two strings for a given length might be the same? \n\n     Example: n=3, string \"aaa\": \n        prefixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n        suffixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n\n     Then, the two strings of length 1 are both \"a\", and the two strings of length 2 are both \"aa\".\n\n     In this case, we cannot distinguish which is which.\n\n 43. Therefore, we must account for duplicates.\n\n 44. Revised plan:\n\n     We are going to assign each string (by its index) to either P or S, but we know that for each length, exactly one of the two strings is P and the other is S.\n\n     We can use dynamic programming or backtracking, but the state space is too large.\n\n 45. Alternative Insight:\n\n     The entire string s must be such that for each length L, the prefix and suffix are fixed.\n\n     What if we consider the entire string s? We don't know s, but we can try to recover s from the given set.\n\n     Note: the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of s must be the given set.\n\n     How to recover s?\n\n        s has length n.\n\n        The set of proper prefixes: { s[0:i] for i in range(1, n) }\n        The set of proper suffixes: { s[i:n] for i in range(0, n-1) }\n\n        So, we are given exactly these.\n\n     Then, we can try to merge the two sets to form s.\n\n        Let the two strings of length 1 be a and b. Then, without loss of generality, assume s[0] = a and s[-1] = b, or vice versa.\n\n        Then, the two strings of length 2: one is the prefix (s[0:2]) and the other is the suffix (s[-2:]).\n\n        Then, the two strings of length 3: one is s[0:3] and the other is s[-3:].\n\n        Then, the entire string s must be of length n. Then, the two strings of length n-1: \n            prefix: s[0:n-1]\n            suffix: s[1:n]\n\n        Then, the entire string s is: \n            s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1] \n\n        And we know s[0] and s[n-1] from length 1.\n\n        Then, from the two strings of length 2, we get two more: \n            If the prefix of length 2 is given, then we know s[0] and s[1].\n            If the suffix of length 2 is given, then we know s[n-2] and s[n-1].\n\n        Then, from the two strings of length 3, we get either s[0:3] or s[n-3:n]. \n\n        How can we combine?\n\n        Actually, we can reconstruct s by:\n\n          Let P(L) be the prefix of length L (if we assign as prefix) and S(L) be the suffix of length L (if we assign as suffix).\n\n          Then, we must have:\n            P(1) = s[0:1]\n            P(2) = s[0:2] = P(1) + s[1]\n            ...\n            S(1) = s[n-1]\n            S(2) = s[n-2:n] = s[n-2] + S(1)\n\n          But note: the entire string s must be consistent. The prefix P(L) must be s[0:L] and the suffix S(L) must be s[n-L:n].\n\n          Then, the entire string s must be: \n            s[0] = P(1)   (if we assign P(1) as prefix) or S(1) (if we assign S(1) as suffix) but wait, actually we don't know.\n\n        Actually, we don't know the assignment. But note: the two strings of length 1 are the two possibilities for the first character and the last character.\n\n        Then, the entire string s must start with one of them and end with the other.\n\n        Then, for the two strings of length 2, one must be the continuation of the prefix and the other must be the continuation of the suffix.\n\n        Then, we can determine the entire string by:\n\n          Let the two length-1 strings be a and b.\n\n          Case 1: assign a as prefix and b as suffix.\n\n            Then s[0] = a, s[-1] = b.\n\n            Then, the two length-2 strings: one must be a + ? and the other must be ? + b.\n\n            Let the two length-2 strings be c and d.\n\n            Then, one of them must start with a, and the other must end with b.\n\n            Then, we can identify:\n\n                candidate_prefix_2 = the one that starts with a\n                candidate_suffix_2 = the one that ends with b\n\n            Then, from candidate_prefix_2, we get s[1] = candidate_prefix_2[1] (if candidate_prefix_2 is the prefix of length2).\n\n            From candidate_suffix_2, we get s[n-2] = candidate_suffix_2[0] (if candidate_suffix_2 is the suffix of length2).\n\n            Then, we have s[0] and s[1] and s[n-2] and s[n-1].\n\n          Then, we can extend to length 3.\n\n        However, we are not required to output the string s, only the assignment of each input string.\n\n 46. But note: the input order of the strings is arbitrary. We have to output a string of 'P' and 'S' of length 2n-2 in the same order as the input.\n\n 47. We must assign each string (in the input order) to either 'P' or 'S'.\n\n 48. Steps:\n\n     a. Read n and the list of strings.\n\n     b. We need to remember the original order.\n\n     c. Group the strings by length, but we also need to know the index (original position) for each string.\n\n     d. We can process the lengths from 1 to n-1 and for each length, assign one of the two strings as 'P' and the other as 'S'. But we have to assign based on the consistency with the entire chain.\n\n     e. Alternatively, we can first assign the two strings of length 1 arbitrarily (both possibilities) and then propagate the assignment to longer lengths.\n\n     f. However, we must output the assignment in the original input order.\n\n 49. Proposed algorithm:\n\n     Step 1: Store the input along with their index.\n\n        lines = []\n        for i in range(2*n-2):\n            s = input().strip()\n            lines.append(s)\n\n        Then, we also store the index.\n\n     Step 2: Group by length, but keep the original index.\n\n        groups = {}\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            groups[l] = []\n\n        for idx, string in enumerate(lines):\n            l = len(string)\n            if l not in groups:\n                groups[l] = []\n            groups[l].append((idx, string))\n\n     Step 3: We will create an array `ans` of length (2*n-2) initially with None.\n\n        Then, we want to assign for each length from 1 to n-1, one string as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n     Step 4: We try the two possibilities for length 1.\n\n        Possibility 1: assign the first string of length1 (arbitrary order) as 'P' and the second as 'S'.\n        Possibility 2: assign the second as 'P' and the first as 'S'.\n\n        But note: the two strings of length1 are two, but the input order is arbitrary. So we should consider both.\n\n        However, we can fix an ordering: for a given length L, we have two strings. We can choose one arbitrarily, but we must check consistency.\n\n        But we don't know which is which. So we have two possibilities.\n\n     Step 5: How to check consistency for a possibility?\n\n        We assume an assignment for length1: \n            Let the two strings at length1: (idx1, a) and (idx2, b)\n            Possibility 1: \n                assign a as 'P', then the first character of the entire string is a (since a is of length1).\n                assign b as 'S', then the last character is b.\n\n            Then, for length2: we have two strings, say c and d (with indices idx3, idx4).\n\n            Condition for length2: \n                The prefix of length2 must start with a (because the entire string starts with a, so the first two characters are a + next_char).\n                The suffix of length2 must end with b.\n\n            Then, we check:\n                Is one of c or d starting with a? and the other ending with b?\n\n            Then, we assign the one that starts with a as 'P' and the one that ends with b as 'S'.\n\n            Then, for the next length (if any), we use the assigned prefix and suffix to continue.\n\n        For length L, we have two strings, say x and y.\n\n        We assume that the prefix of length L is the one that is the continuation of the previous prefix (if we have assigned a prefix for length L-1) and similarly the suffix of length L is the one that is the continuation of the previous suffix.\n\n        Specifically, the prefix of length L must be the previous prefix of length L-1 plus one extra character. Similarly, the suffix of length L must be one extra character at the beginning plus the previous suffix of length L-1.\n\n        However, note: the suffix of length L is defined as the last L characters. So the suffix of length L must end with the previously assigned suffix of length L-1.\n\n        But also, the prefix of length L must start with the previously assigned prefix of length L-1.\n\n        Then, for the two strings of length L:\n\n            Condition for a string to be the prefix: it must start with the prefix of length L-1.\n\n            Condition for a string to be the suffix: it must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n        Then, we must assign one of the two to be the prefix and the other to be the suffix, and both conditions must hold.\n\n        However, what if both conditions hold for the same string? That would be a problem. Then, the other string must not satisfy either condition? \n\n        But note: the two strings are distinct? Not necessarily. Example: n=3, string \"aaa\": \n            length1: ['a','a'] -> same string\n            length2: ['aa','aa'] -> same string\n\n        Then, how do we assign? We have two strings of length1: both 'a'. Then we have two possibilities for length1, but they are symmetric.\n\n        Then, for length2: we have two strings of length2: both 'aa'. \n            Condition: the prefix must start with 'a' (which both do) and the suffix must end with 'a' (which both do). \n\n        Then, we can assign arbitrarily: one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n        But note: the entire string must be \"aaa\". Then the prefix of length2 is \"aa\", and the suffix of length2 is \"aa\". \n\n        However, the problem says: the set of proper prefixes and suffixes is {'a','aa'} (two of each). \n\n        But wait, the input has two 'a' and two 'aa'. \n\n        Then, we must assign one 'a' as prefix and the other 'a' as suffix, and one 'aa' as prefix and the other 'aa' as suffix.\n\n        But note: the entire string is \"aaa\", so the prefix of length1 is \"a\", and the prefix of length2 is \"aa\", and the suffix of length1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length2 is \"aa\". \n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        However, the assignment for the two 'a' strings: one is prefix and one is suffix. Similarly for the two 'aa' strings.\n\n        But the condition for length2: \n            The prefix of length2 must start with the prefix of length1: which is 'a'. Both 'aa' start with 'a'.\n            The suffix of length2 must end with the suffix of length1: which is 'a'. Both 'aa' end with 'a'.\n\n        Then, we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          We process from length 1 to n-1.\n\n          For length 1, we try the two possibilities arbitrarily (but we have two strings, so two possibilities).\n\n          Then, for each subsequent length L (from 2 to n-1):\n\n            We have two strings.\n\n            We must assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n                candidate_prefix = string that starts with the previously assigned prefix of length L-1.\n                candidate_suffix = string that ends with the previously assigned suffix of length L-1.\n\n            But note: it is possible that one string satisfies both, or one satisfies none, or both satisfy one condition.\n\n            However, the problem guarantees that the set is from some string s, so there must be exactly one string that is the prefix (if we know the previous prefix) and exactly one string that is the suffix (if we know the previous suffix). \n\n            But wait: the two strings for length L are the two possibilities: one is the prefix (which is the previous prefix extended) and the other is the suffix (which is the previous suffix extended). \n\n            However, the two conditions (starting with the previous prefix and ending with the previous suffix) might be satisfied by the same string? \n\n            Example: \n                Previous prefix (length L-1): \"abc\"\n                Previous suffix (length L-1): \"cba\"\n                Then, the prefix of length L is \"abcX\" and the suffix of length L is \"Xcba\". \n\n                Now, if the two strings for length L are \"abcX\" and \"Xcba\", then:\n\n                    \"abcX\": starts with \"abc\" (good for prefix) but ends with \"X\", which may or may not be the same as the previous suffix's last character? We don't know.\n\n            Actually, the condition for the suffix is: the string must end with the previously assigned suffix (which is of length L-1). \n\n            So, the suffix of length L must end with the entire previously assigned suffix (which is the last L-1 characters). \n\n            Example: \n                Entire string s = \"abcde\", then \n                length1: 'a' (prefix) and 'e' (suffix)\n                length2: 'ab' (prefix) and 'de' (suffix)\n\n            Then, for length2: \n                The two strings: 'ab' and 'de'\n\n                Condition for 'ab': starts with 'a' (prefix of length1) -> yes.\n                Condition for 'de': ends with 'e' (suffix of length1) -> yes.\n\n            Now, for length3: \n                The two strings: 'abc' (prefix) and 'cde' (suffix)\n\n                Condition for prefix: must start with 'ab' -> 'abc' starts with 'ab' -> yes.\n                Condition for suffix: must end with 'de' -> 'cde' ends with 'de' -> yes.\n\n            Then, we assign 'abc' as prefix and 'cde' as suffix.\n\n            But note: the entire string s is \"abcde\", so the prefix of length3 is \"abc\", and the suffix of length3 is \"cde\". \n\n            However, the condition for the suffix of length3 is that it must end with the suffix of length2, which is \"de\", and indeed \"cde\" ends with \"de\".\n\n            Now, what if we had a string that satisfies both conditions? \n\n            Example: \n                Suppose we have a string s = \"aba\", n=3.\n\n                Then, the proper prefixes: \n                    length1: \"a\", length2: \"ab\"\n                proper suffixes:\n                    length1: \"a\", length2: \"ba\"\n\n                Then, the input: \n                    n=3\n                    Strings: \n                        \"a\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\"\n\n                Now, for length1: \n                    Possibility 1: assign the first 'a' as prefix and the second 'a' as suffix.\n                    Possibility 2: the other way.\n\n                Then, for length2:\n                    Two strings: \"ab\" and \"ba\"\n\n                    Condition for prefix (if we took the first 'a' as prefix): the prefix of length2 must start with \"a\". \n                        \"ab\": starts with \"a\" -> good.\n                        \"ba\": does not start with \"a\" -> bad.\n\n                    Condition for suffix (if we took the second 'a' as suffix): the suffix of length2 must end with \"a\".\n                        \"ab\": ends with 'b' -> bad.\n                        \"ba\": ends with 'a' -> good.\n\n                    Then, we must assign \"ab\" as prefix and \"ba\" as suffix.\n\n                Now, what if we had chosen the opposite for length1?\n\n                    Possibility 2: assign the first 'a' as suffix and the second 'a' as prefix.\n\n                    Then, for length2:\n                        Condition for prefix: must start with the prefix of length1 (which is the second 'a') -> so the prefix of length2 must start with \"a\": \n                            \"ab\": starts with \"a\" -> good.\n                            \"ba\": does not start with \"a\" -> bad.\n\n                        Condition for suffix: must end with the suffix of length1 (which is the first 'a'):\n                            \"ab\": ends with 'b' -> bad.\n                            \"ba\": ends with 'a' -> good.\n\n                    Then, we assign \"ab\" as prefix and \"ba\" as suffix.\n\n                In both possibilities, we end up with the same assignment for length2.\n\n                But note: the assignment for length1 is different. However, the problem only requires to output the assignment for the input order.\n\n                In the input, the two 'a' strings are given arbitrarily. Then, the output should mark the first occurrence as either 'P' or 'S', and the second occurrence accordingly.\n\n                But the two possibilities for length1 lead to different assignments for the two 'a' strings.\n\n                Example: \n                    Input order: \n                        3\n                        a\n                        a\n                        ab\n                        ba\n\n                    Possibility 1: \n                        first 'a' -> 'P', second 'a' -> 'S'\n                        Then, output for the four strings: \n                            first 'a': 'P'\n                            second 'a': 'S'\n                            'ab': 'P'\n                            'ba': 'S'\n\n                    Possibility 2:\n                        first 'a' -> 'S', second 'a' -> 'P'\n                        Then, output: \n                            first 'a': 'S'\n                            second 'a': 'P'\n                            'ab': 'P'\n                            'ba': 'S'\n\n                Which one is correct? \n\n                In the entire string s=\"aba\", the proper prefixes are \"a\" and \"ab\", and the proper suffixes are \"a\" and \"ba\". \n\n                Then, the set of strings is {'a','a','ab','ba'}. \n\n                How do we know which one is prefix and which one is suffix? \n\n                Actually, the problem does not specify which string is which. But the assignment must be:\n\n                    One of the two 'a' must be the prefix (the first character) and the other must be the suffix (the last character). \n\n                However, the entire string s=\"aba\" has the prefix of length1=\"a\" and the suffix of length1=\"a\". \n\n                But note: the definition: \n                    Prefixes: s[0:1] = \"a\", s[0:2] = \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string in the input is a prefix or a suffix of a hidden string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`. The solution involves grouping these strings by their lengths and then determining the correct assignment (prefix or suffix) for each string based on consistency checks with previously assigned strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process each group independently.\n2. **Initial Assignment for Length 1**: For strings of length 1, we consider both possible assignments (one as prefix and the other as suffix). This forms the basis for checking consistency with longer strings.\n3. **Consistency Check for Longer Strings**: For each subsequent length, we check which of the two strings can be a prefix (must start with the previously assigned prefix of the shorter length) and which can be a suffix (must end with the previously assigned suffix of the shorter length). This ensures the entire set of prefixes and suffixes is consistent with some hidden string `s`.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all lengths, we output 'P' for strings assigned as prefixes and 'S' for those assigned as suffixes, maintaining the original input order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n -

Specifically, a prefix must start with the previous prefix, and a suffix must end with the previous suffix.\n4. **Output**: After processing all lengths, the solution outputs a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating the assignment of each input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for consistency in the assignment of prefixes and suffixes, ensuring the solution meets the problem requirements.",
