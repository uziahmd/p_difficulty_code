The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (at least one step after the initial) such that:\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: Start with 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k vertices connected to the center. Now total vertices = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 now each get k new vertices? But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices. And we must do this at least once.\n\n However, note that the example for k=4 is the smallest snowflake. The example drawing probably shows:\n   Step0: 1 vertex (center)\n   Step1: center connects to 4 -> total 5\n   Then, the 4 leaves each connect to 4 new ones? Then total becomes 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 21.\n\n But wait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning we can do more than once? Actually, the model says:\n\n   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\n   Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n So the process:\n\n   Level0: 1 node (center)\n   Level1: center adds k nodes -> total = 1 + k\n   Then, we have k leaves (each has degree 1). Now, we must do the next step at least once.\n\n   Level2: each leaf from level1 adds k new nodes -> then we add k*k nodes.\n\n   Then, if we do another step (if we want), then we would take the leaves from level2 (which are the new nodes added at level2) and each would add k new nodes.\n\n   So the total number of vertices after t steps (with t>=1) is:\n\n     n = 1 + k + k*k + ... + k^t\n\n   But note: the initial step (the first expansion) is step1 (t=1) and then we do at least one more step (so minimum two expansions: t>=2? Actually, the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\" and then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n     Step0: 1 node.\n     Step1: Add k nodes -> now we have 1+k nodes. In this step, the center has degree k, and the new k nodes have degree 1.\n\n     Then we must do the second step (at least once) for the leaves (the k nodes). So:\n\n     Step2: For each of the k leaves, we add k new nodes. Then we have 1 + k + k*k nodes.\n\n     And we can do more steps? The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning that we do the expansion for the leaves at least one time (so step2 is mandatory). But can we do more?\n\n     The problem does not say we cannot do more. It just says at least once. So the snowflake can have any number of layers (t >= 2, because step1 is the first expansion and then at least one more).\n\n     However, note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" gets expanded. After step2, the leaves from step2 (the ones we just added) are still of degree 1? Actually, no: in step2 we added edges from the leaf (from step1) to k new nodes. So the leaf from step1 now has degree (1 + k) [one edge to center and k edges to the new ones] and the new nodes have degree 1. Then we can do step3 for the leaves from step2.\n\n     So the entire structure is:\n\n        Layer0: center (1 node)\n        Layer1: k nodes (children of center)\n        Layer2: k*k nodes (children of layer1 nodes)\n        Layer3: k*k*k nodes (children of layer2 nodes)\n\n        ...\n\n        Layer t: k^t nodes\n\n        Total nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n     Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n\n        Does there exist integers k>1 and t>=2 (since the first expansion is step1 and then we must do at least one more, so t>=2 meaning the total layers is at least 2, but note: our formula above goes from exponent 0 to t, so the highest layer is t and the exponents go from 0 to t, so the number of expansions is t+1? Let's reframe.)\n\n     Actually, the initial state is step0 (exponent0). Then we do:\n\n        Step1: t=0 expansion? Or let's define:\n\n        Let m = number of expansions (including the initial one). Then the total layers is m, and the total nodes is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n        But note: the problem says the first expansion (step1) is the center connecting to k, and then we must do the expansion for the leaves at least once (so step2). So we require m>=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the expansion as happening for m layers (starting from the center) and then the total layers is m (with the center being layer0). Then the total number of vertices is:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        Conditions: \n          k>1, m>=2 (because we must do the expansion at least two times: the first expansion from center and then at least one more for the leaves).\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion for leaves is done at least once. The expansion for leaves is the second expansion. So the minimal case is two expansions (m=2) and then we have:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n        But wait, the problem also allows more than two expansions. So m can be any integer from 2 to ... until n is reached.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that we have to use the same k for all layers? Actually, the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is connected by edges to k more new vertices. So k is fixed.\n\n        So the equation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (with m>=2)\n\n        But note: the geometric series: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)   [if we consider from k^0 to k^m]\n\n        However, wait: if we do m expansions, then the layers are from 0 to m (so m+1 layers). But the expansions are m steps (each step adds one layer). The first expansion (step1) adds layer1 (k nodes). The second expansion (step2) adds layer2 (k^2 nodes). So the total expansions (steps) is m, and the total layers is m+1 (from 0 to m). Then the formula is:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion beyond the center must be done at least once. So we require m>=1 (for the expansion from the center) and then at least one more expansion (so m>=2). Alternatively, if we count the center as step0, then:\n\n          Step0: 1 node\n          Step1: add k (now total 1+k) -> m=1 (one expansion)\n          Step2: add k^2 (now total 1+k+k^2) -> m=2 (two expansions)\n\n        So we require at least two expansions (m>=2) to satisfy the condition (because the problem says \"This step [expanding leaves] should be done at least once\", which is the second expansion).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal representation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2   (m=2)\n\n        But what if we do more than two? Then we can have:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (m>=2)\n\n        However, note: the problem does not fix m. We are allowed to choose k>1 and m>=2 (or equivalently, the number of layers is at least 2) such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        But note: there's another way to get n? What if we consider that the expansion might stop arbitrarily at any layer? So we are free to choose k and m (with m>=2) as long as the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"there exists such k>1\". So we don't care about m, as long as there is some k>1 and some m>=2 (or equivalently, the expansion beyond the center is done at least once) such that:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        But wait, what if we consider the possibility of different numbers of layers? Actually, the problem says the entire snowflake is built by the rule. So we must have the entire graph built by the rule, and the rule builds exactly the complete m-layered snowflake (with m>=2).\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that the entire snowflake is built by expanding every leaf until the last generation. But the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is expanded. So if we stop at a certain layer, then the leaves of that layer are not expanded. Therefore, the graph is exactly the one with m layers (from 0 to m) and m>=2.\n\n        But note: the problem does not say we must expand until we reach n, but we are given n and we are to check if there exists k and m (with m>=2) such that the total number of vertices is n.\n\n        However, note: the process must be done at least once (the expansion for leaves) so we cannot have m=1 (only the center expansion) because then the leaves are not expanded. So m>=2.\n\n        Now, the challenge: given n (up to 10^18) and t up to 10000, we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and m>=2 such that:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        Note: m>=2, and k>=2.\n\n        We can try to fix the exponent (m) and then solve for k? Or fix k and then check for m?\n\n        But note: n can be as large as 10^18, and m can be as large as ...? The maximum m: since k>=2, the smallest n for a fixed m is when k=2:\n\n          m=2: n = (2^3-1)/(2-1) = 7\n          m=3: n = (2^4-1)/(2-1) = 15\n          m=4: n = (2^5-1)/(2-1) = 31\n          ...\n\n        The maximum m: we know that k>=2, so the minimal n for m layers is (2^(m+1)-1). We require (2^(m+1)-1) <= 10^18.\n\n        How big can m be? 2^(m+1) <= 10^18 + 1 => m+1 <= log2(10^18+1) ≈ 60. So m is at most 60.\n\n        Therefore, we can iterate over m from 2 to about 60 (so 59 possibilities per test case) and then for each m, we need to solve:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        for k>1 (integer).\n\n        Rearranged:\n\n          n*(k-1) = k^(m+1) - 1\n\n        or\n\n          k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        We can try to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n          k^(m+1) - n*(k-1) - 1 = 0\n\n        However, note: the equation is nonlinear. But we can note:\n\n          For a fixed m, the left-hand side is a polynomial of degree (m+1) in k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use binary search for k for a fixed m? But note: n can be up to 10^18 and m is at most 60, so k^(m+1) is about n*(k-1)+1, and k is roughly around the (m+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1. But k is at least 2 and at most around n (but note: when m=2, k^3 = n*(k-1)+1, so k^3 is about n*k, so k^2 ~ n, so k ~ sqrt(n). Since n can be 10^18, k could be as large as 10^9 for m=2, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        Another idea: for a fixed m, we have:\n\n          k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        We can rearrange:\n\n          k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        Then, for k>=2, we can try to find k by iterating? But note: the left side grows very fast. We can use binary search for k for a fixed m.\n\n        Steps for fixed m (>=2):\n\n          We are to solve for integer k>=2:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        Rearranged:\n\n            k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        Since k>=2, we can set a lower bound: k_min = 2, and an upper bound.\n\n        Note: k^(m+1) must be approximately n*k (for large k). So k^m ~ n, so k is about n^(1/m). But note: m is at least 2 and at most 60. Also, n can be as small as 1 (then we output NO) or as large as 10^18.\n\n        However, note: we have multiple test cases (up to 10000). We cannot iterate for each test case over m from 2 to 60 and then for each m do a binary search for k from 2 to n^(1/m) (which for m=2 is sqrt(n) and n=10^18 gives 10^9, which is too many for a binary search that takes O(log(10^9)) which is acceptable for one m, but we have 59 values of m per test case, and 10000 test cases -> 59 * 10000 * log2(10^9) operations, which is about 59 * 10000 * 30 = 17.7e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n        However, note: we cannot iterate 10000 test cases each with 59 m's and each m requiring a binary search over k from 2 to n^(1/m) because the upper bound for k for a fixed m is the (m+1)-th root of n*k, but we can set an upper bound for k for a fixed m:\n\n        From: k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        For k>=2, the left side is k^(m+1) and the right side is n*(k-1)+1. Since k^(m+1) grows faster than linear, we can set an upper bound.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that k must be at most around n (if m=2, then k^3 = n*(k-1)+1, and k^3 < n*k, so k^2 < n, so k < sqrt(n)). Similarly, for m=3, k^4 = n*(k-1)+1, then k^4 < n*k, so k^3 < n, so k < n^(1/3). \n\n        Therefore, for each m, the maximum k we need to consider is the floor of the (m+1)-th root of n*k, but we don't know k. However, we can set an upper bound for k: \n\n          k^(m+1) <= n*k   (since n*k - n + 1 < n*k for n>=1 and k>=2)\n\n          => k^m <= n\n\n          => k <= n**(1/m)\n\n        But note: the equation is k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1, so for k>=2, we have:\n\n          k^(m+1) <= n*k   (because n*k - n + 1 < n*k)\n\n          => k^m <= n\n\n        So k <= n**(1/m)\n\n        However, n**(1/m) for n=10^18 and m=2 is 10^9, which is too big to iterate over. But we are doing binary search, so we only need to do about 30 iterations per m. \n\n        But wait: we have to do this for each m from 2 to 60 and for each test case (10000 test cases). That would be 59 * 10000 * 30 ~ 17.7e6 binary search steps. However, each step of the binary search requires computing k^(m+1) for k in the middle of the range. \n\n        The exponentiation: k^(m+1) for k up to 10^9 and m+1 up to 61? That is too expensive because 10^9 raised to the 61st power is astronomically huge. \n\n        Alternative approach: we can use the fact that the equation is:\n\n          k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        We can rearrange and use a different method for fixed m: we can solve for k by checking if there exists an integer k such that:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        We can compute the geometric series for k and m+1 (from exponent 0 to m) and see if it equals n.\n\n        But note: we are iterating m from 2 to 60, so the maximum exponent is 61. Then we can compute the geometric series for a candidate k? But k is unknown.\n\n        Instead, we can iterate over possible k for a fixed m? But k can be as large as n**(1/m) (which for m=2 is 10^9) which is too large to iterate.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Observation: the equation is:\n\n          (k^(m+1)-1) = (k-1)*n\n\n        We can use binary search on k for fixed m, but without computing k^(m+1) directly (which is too big) we can use logarithms? But we need integer solutions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use Newton's method? Not really.\n\n        Another idea: for fixed m, we can consider that k must be an integer divisor of (n*(k-1)+1) in a way, but that doesn't help.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n          k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n        We can use binary search for k, but we must avoid computing k^(m+1) for very large k (like 10^9) because that number is too big to represent.\n\n        But note: n can be up to 10^18, and k is at most about n**(1/m). For m=2, k is at most about 10^9, and then k^3 is (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers can handle arbitrary precision, but 10^27 is acceptable in terms of representation but the exponentiation might be slow.\n\n        However, we are only doing 17.7e6 * (number of exponentiations) but each exponentiation for m=2 is a cube, for m=3 is a fourth power, etc. The maximum exponent is 61, and the base k is at most 10^9 (for m=2) and for m=3, k is at most 10^6 (because n=10^18, then k^3 ~ 10^18 -> k ~ 10^6). \n\n        But note: the equation for fixed m and candidate k is:\n\n          k^(m+1) == n*k - n + 1\n\n        We can compute k^(m+1) for k in the binary search range. However, the range for k for a fixed m is from 2 to ceil(n**(1/m)) + 1. \n\n        Steps for fixed m:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = 2\n          # First, we need an upper bound. We know k <= n**(1/m) + 1, but we don't know n**(1/m) for integer k.\n\n          We can set high initially as 2, and then while (high)^(m+1) < n*high - n + 1, we double high until we exceed.\n\n        However, we cannot compute (high)^(m+1) for very high values because it's too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use logarithms to estimate the value of k. But we need exact integer arithmetic.\n\n        Another idea: we can rearrange the equation and use the fact that k must be an integer. We can check the equation without computing huge numbers by using logarithms to bound the k? \n\n        But we need exact equality.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the geometric series is defined for integer k and m, and we can try to find k by solving the polynomial equation, but that is difficult.\n\n        Let's change our approach: note that the equation:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        is equivalent to:\n\n          n*(k-1) = k^(m+1)-1\n\n        We can compute the right-hand side (k^(m+1)) and compare to n*(k-1)+1. But the left side might be too big.\n\n        But note: m is at most 60, so the exponent is at most 61. However, k can be as large as 10^9 (for m=2) and then k^3 is 10^27 which is acceptable in Python (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation might be slow and memory-consuming). However, we are doing at most 30 iterations per m (binary search) and 59 m's per test case, and 10000 test cases -> 10000 * 59 * 30 = 17.7e6 iterations. In each iteration, we do an exponentiation with exponent up to 61 and base up to 10^9 (for m=2) and even for m=60, the base k is at most (n)^(1/60) which for n=10^18 is about 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3 ~ 2. So for m=60, k is at most 2.\n\n        However, for m=2, we are exponentiating k^3 for k up to 10^9. The number of digits is about 3e9 digits? No, wait: 10^9^3 is 10^27, which is a 28-digit number. Python can handle that, but doing 17.7e6 such exponentiations (each taking O( (log exponent) * (number of digits) )? Actually, the exponentiation for base k (which is up to 10^9) and exponent 3 (for m=2) is just one multiplication: k*k*k. But for exponent 61, we do 61 multiplications? Actually, exponentiation by squaring: the exponent 61 has about 6 bits, so about 6 multiplications.\n\n        But the base k for m=2 can be up to 10^9, so k*k is 10^18 (which is acceptable) and then *k is 10^27 (which is acceptable). For m=60, k is at most 2, so 2^61 is about 2e18, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, worst-case m=2 and k=10^9: we are doing (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a number with 28 digits. Then we compare to n*k - n + 1, which for n=10^18 and k=10^9, n*k is 10^27, so we are comparing two 28-digit numbers.\n\n        The problem: 10000 test cases, each test case we do 59 m's, and for each m we do about 30 binary search steps. In each step, we compute k^(m+1) and compare to n*k - n + 1.\n\n        The total number of exponentiations is 17.7e6, and each exponentiation is for an exponent between 3 and 61 (so at most 61 multiplications? Actually, exponentiation by squaring: the number of multiplications is O(log(exponent)). The exponent is m+1 (from 3 to 61) so the exponent is small (at most 61, which is 6 bits). So each exponentiation is about 6 multiplications.\n\n        However, the base k can be very large (like 10^9) and the exponent is 3 (for m=2) so it's just three multiplications. But for larger k, the numbers become very big (like 10^9^61 is astronomical, but note: for m>=3, k is bounded by n**(1/(m)) and n=10^18, so for m=3, k is at most 10^6, for m=4, k is at most 10^4.5, so about 30000, and then k^5 is 30000^5 = 2.43e20, which is acceptable for 10000 test cases? Actually, we are only doing 17.7e6 exponentiations, but the numbers involved in the exponentiations for m>=3 are not extremely huge because k is bounded by n**(1/m) and m>=3, so k is much smaller.\n\n        But wait: what if n is 10^18 and m=2, then k is at most 10^9, and we do one exponentiation per candidate k (about 30 candidates) for each test case and for m=2. And there are 10000 test cases. So we would do 10000 * 1 * 30 = 300000 exponentiations for m=2. Each exponentiation for m=2 (which is k^3) is cheap (three multiplications). But for m=3, the same: k^4, and k is at most 10^6, so k^4 is (10^6)^4 = 10^24, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, worst-case: if we have many test cases (10000) and for each we try m=2, m=3, ... m=60, and for each m we do about 30 binary search steps, then the total number of exponentiations is 10000 * 60 * 30 = 18e6. And each exponentiation for base k (which is an integer) and exponent e (from 3 to 61) is done by pow(k, e). \n\n        But note: k can be as large as 10^9 (for m=2) and then k^3 is 10^27, which is acceptable. But for m=2, we are doing 10000 * 30 * 1 (for m=2) = 300000 exponentiations of base up to 10^9 and exponent 3. Then for m=3, base up to 10^6 and exponent 4: 10000 * 30 * 1 = 300000 exponentiations of base up to 10^6 and exponent 4.\n\n        The total cost: \n\n          For m=2: 300000 exponentiations, each with base up to 10^9 and exponent 3: each exponentiation is 3 multiplications (k*k, then *k). The numbers are up to 10^27, which is about 2^90, so 3 multiplications of numbers with 10^9 digits? Actually, no: 10^9 is the base, so the base is 10^9 (which is about 30 bits), then k^2 is 10^18 (60 bits), then k^3 is 10^27 (about 90 bits). These are small integers in terms of bit-length (less than 300 bits). So the multiplications are cheap.\n\n        Similarly, for m=3: base k up to 10^6, exponent 4: k^4 is (10^6)^4 = 10^24 (about 80 bits). Again, small.\n\n        But wait: what if n is very close to the minimal value for a given m and k? Then k might be large. However, we are using binary search and we set the bounds appropriately.\n\n        However, there's a catch: we must be careful for the case when n is very small (like n=1,2,...,6) and m>=2. Then we cannot have a valid k (because the minimal n for m=2 is 1+2+4=7, for m=3 is 1+2+4+8=15, etc). So for n<7, we can immediately say NO (unless there is an alternative representation?).\n\n        But note: the problem says we must do the expansion at least once (so m>=2). The minimal n for m=2 is 7 (k=2). For k=3, n=1+3+9=13. So n=7,13,15,31,... are YES.\n\n        However, what if there is a representation with more layers (m>=3) for a small n? For example, n=15: \n          m=2: 15 = (k^3-1)/(k-1) -> k^3-1 = 15*(k-1) -> k^3 = 15k-14. k=2: 8 vs 30-14=16 -> no. k=3: 27 vs 45-14=31 -> no. k=4: 64 vs 60-14=46 -> no. So m=2 fails for n=15.\n          m=3: n= (k^4-1)/(k-1) = 15 -> k^4-1 = 15*(k-1) -> k^4 = 15k-14. k=2: 16 vs 30-14=16 -> yes.\n\n        So n=15 is YES (with k=2 and m=3).\n\n        Therefore, we must check all m from 2 to about 60.\n\n        Algorithm for one test case:\n\n          If n==1: then we can consider? But note: the minimal step is at least two expansions (so n must be at least 7). Also, the problem states: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1) and then the expansion of leaves is done at least once. So n=1 is the initial state? But then we haven't done the first expansion. The problem says \"Then, more vertices are added\" (meaning the first expansion is mandatory). So n=1 is not allowed. Also, the problem says k>1, so the first expansion adds at least 2 vertices. Therefore, n>=1+2+2^2 = 7? Actually, no: the minimal n is 1 (initial) + k (first expansion) + k^2 (second expansion). The problem says \"This step [expanding leaves] should be done at least once\", so we must do the second expansion. Therefore, n>=1+k+k^2, and the minimal k=2, so n>=7.\n\n          So we can immediately say:\n\n            n=1,2,...,6 -> NO.\n\n          Then, we consider m from 2 to 60 (or until the minimal value for the current m exceeds n).\n\n          For each m:\n\n            We wish to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n              (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n            We can use binary search for k in the range [2, min(10**9, n**(1/m) + 1)]? But we don't want to set an arbitrary upper bound.\n\n            Instead, we can set:\n\n              low = 2\n              high = 2\n              # We know that k must satisfy: k^(m+1) <= n*k (from the equation: k^(m+1)=n*k-n+1 < n*k). So k^m <= n.\n\n              # But we can set high = 2, and then while (high)^(m+1) < n*high - n + 1, we set high *= 2, until high is too big.\n\n            However, we must avoid computing huge numbers. Alternatively, we can use an iterative doubling that stops when we are sure that high is greater than the solution.\n\n            Steps for fixed m:\n\n              low = 2\n              high = 2\n\n              # First, we need to find an upper bound. We know k^m <= n (from k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1 < n*k, so k^m < n, so k < n**(1/m))\n\n              # But we don't know n**(1/m) exactly. We can set:\n\n              while (pow(high, m+1) < n * high - n + 1) and (pow(high, m+1) != -1):   # But pow(high, m+1) might overflow in representation? Actually, we are using Python integers and they are arbitrary precision, but we don't want to compute huge numbers.\n\n              Alternatively, we can use logarithms to avoid huge numbers? But we need exact integer comparison.\n\n            Another idea: we can use the fact that k must be at least 2 and at most floor(n**(1/m)) (from k^m <= n). But then we can set:\n\n              high = min(10**18, int(round(n**(1/m))) + 100\n\n            But n=10^18, and m=2, then n**(1/2)=10^9, which is acceptable. But for m=1 (not used) and n=10^18, then n**(1/1)=10^18, which is too big for integer rounding? Actually, we can use:\n\n              high = 2\n              while (high ** (m+1)) < n * high - n + 1:\n                  high *= 2\n                  # But note: we must break if high is too big? We can break if high > n (then no solution) or if high^(m+1) is too big to compute?\n\n            However, we can use logarithms to check without computing the full power:\n\n              Condition: k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n              Take log base 10: (m+1)*log10(k) = log10(n*k - n + 1)\n\n            But again, we need exact integers.\n\n        Given the constraints (m<=60, and k is not too big because k^m <= n, and n<=10^18, then k is at most 10^18**(1/m)), we can set:\n\n          high = 2\n          while True:\n              # Compute power = high**(m+1)\n              # But if high is too big, we break. We break when high**(m+1) >= n*high",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single central vertex. Each subsequent layer expands by connecting each leaf node (nodes with only one edge) to \\( k \\) new nodes, where \\( k > 1 \\). This expansion must be performed at least once beyond the initial expansion from the central node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after \\( m \\) expansions (where \\( m \\geq 2 \\)) is given by the geometric series sum \\( \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Here, \\( k \\) is the number of new nodes added at each expansion step, and \\( m \\) is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial central node.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can limit \\( m \\) to a maximum of around 60 because \\( 2^{60} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, we first handle small values of \\( n \\) (less than 7) which cannot form a valid snowflake graph. For larger \\( n \\), we iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 2 to 60). For each \\( m \\), we perform a binary search to find if there exists a \\( k \\) such that the equation holds. The binary search efficiently narrows down the possible range of \\( k \\) values by leveraging the geometric series properties.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each test case by checking up to 59 values of \\( m \\). For each \\( m \\), it performs a binary search over possible \\( k \\) values, which involves logarithmic steps relative to \\( n \\). Given \\( t \\) test cases (up to \\( 10^4 \\)), the total operations are manageable due to the constraints on \\( m \\) and the efficiency of binary search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_m = 60\n        \n        for m_val in range(2, max_m + 1):\n            # We know that k^m_val <= n (since k^(m_val+1) = n*k - n + 1 < n*k)\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            \n            while True:\n                power_val = pow(high, m_val + 1)\n                rhs = n * (high - 1) + 1\n                if power_val == rhs:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif power_val < rhs:\n                    low = high\n                    high *= 2\n                    if high > 10**18:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    break\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: For \\( n < 7 \\), it's impossible to form a snowflake graph, so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each \\( m \\) from 2 to 60, the algorithm checks if there exists a \\( k \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\).
