Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burnt candles (which become old) to make more new ones.\n\n Steps:\n   We start by lighting all the new candles we have. Then we burn them and get some old candles.\n\n But note: we can also use the old candles to make more new ones, which then can be burned to give even more old ones.\n\n We can simulate:\n   hours = 0\n   new = a\n   old = 0\n\n   while new > 0:\n        # Burn all the new candles\n        hours += new\n        old += new\n        new = 0   # because we used all the new candles for burning\n\n        # Now, with the old candles, we can make more new ones\n        # How many new candles? old // b, and the remaining old candles after making new ones will be old % b\n        # But note: when we make new candles, we use b old candles per new candle, so we do:\n        #   new = old // b\n        #   old = old % b\n\n        # However, we don't necessarily have to set new=0 immediately after burning? Actually, we are going to use the old ones to make new.\n\n   But wait: after making new candles, we set new to the number of new candles we made, and then we can continue burning.\n\n However, the above simulation might not account for the fact that we can burn the newly made candles in the next iteration.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while current + leftover > 0:\n        # Burn as many as we have (current + leftover) but note: we can only use the current ones and leftover is from previous?\n        # Actually, let's reorganize:\n\n   Another common way is:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   recycle = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        total_hours += candles   # burn all the candles we have\n        recycle += candles       # these become old\n        candles = recycle // b   # make new candles from old\n        recycle = recycle % b    # leftover old candles\n\n   But wait, is that correct? Let's test with the example: a=4, b=2\n\n   Step1: \n        candles = 4, recycle=0\n        total_hours = 0 + 4 -> 4\n        recycle = 0+4 = 4\n        candles = 4//2 = 2\n        recycle = 4 % 2 = 0\n\n   Step2:\n        candles = 2, recycle=0\n        total_hours = 4+2 = 6\n        recycle = 0+2 = 2\n        candles = 2//2 = 1\n        recycle = 2 % 2 = 0\n\n   Step3:\n        candles = 1, recycle=0\n        total_hours = 6+1 = 7\n        recycle = 0+1 = 1\n        candles = 1//2 = 0\n        recycle = 1 % 2 = 1\n\n   Then we break because candles==0.\n\n   So total_hours=7, which matches the sample.\n\n   However, note that at the end we have 1 leftover old candle, but since we don't have any new candles to combine with it, we cannot make a new one.\n\n   But wait, what if we consider that the recycling happens after burning? Actually, the problem says: when a candle burns, it becomes old. Then from the old ones we can make new ones.\n\n   The above simulation does exactly that: we burn the candles (so we add the number of candles we had to the total hours), then we update the old ones and convert them to new ones.\n\n   However, there's a nuance: we are using all the candles we have (both the initial and the recycled) in the same iteration? Actually, we are breaking the process into cycles:\n\n        Cycle 1: Use the initial 'a' candles -> burn them, get 'a' old, then convert old to new: floor(a/b) new candles, and leftover old is a % b.\n\n        Then in the next cycle, we use the new candles we just made.\n\n   But note: the above algorithm does not account for the possibility of having leftover old candles from previous cycles being combined with the new candles? Actually, no. In the next cycle, we use the new candles (from conversion) and we also have leftover old candles. However, in our simulation, we set `candles` to the new candles made, and `recycle` is set to the leftover. Then in the next iteration, we burn the `candles` (which are the new ones) and then we add the burned ones to `recycle` (which now includes the leftover from last time). Then we convert all the `recycle` (which is the total old candles) to new ones.\n\n   But wait, in the example we did:\n\n        First cycle: \n            candles = 4, recycle=0 -> burn 4, then recycle becomes 4, then we make 2 new and 0 leftover.\n        Second cycle:\n            candles = 2, recycle=0 -> burn 2, then recycle becomes 2, then we make 1 new and 0 leftover? Actually, wait: we set recycle = 2 % 2 = 0, but then we have 1 new candle from 2 old ones.\n\n        Then third cycle:\n            candles = 1, recycle=0 -> burn 1, then recycle becomes 1, then we make 0 new and 1 leftover.\n\n   But note: in the second cycle, we should have the leftover from the first cycle? Actually, in the first cycle we set recycle to 0 because we used up all the old candles (4 % 2 = 0). \n\n   However, what if we have leftover from previous cycles? The algorithm sets `recycle` to the leftover from the previous cycle, and then in the next cycle we start with `candles` being the new ones we made and `recycle` being the leftover. Then when we burn, we add the current candles (which are the new ones) to the recycle, so the next cycle's conversion uses the leftover plus the newly burned candles.\n\n   Let me adjust: \n\n        Instead, we can keep two variables: available = current new candles + leftover old candles.\n\n        Then, we burn all available, so we get as many hours as available, and then we get as many old candles as available (because each burned candle becomes one old).\n\n        Then, we can convert these old candles: new_candles = available // b, and leftover_old = available % b.\n\n        Then set available = new_candles, and leftover_old is stored separately? Or we can combine the leftover from previous with the new old ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total = 0\n        current = a\n        leftover = 0\n\n        while current > 0 or leftover > 0:\n            # If we have current candles, we burn them and they become part of the old, but also we have leftover from before?\n            # Actually, we need to combine leftover with current.\n\n            # Burn all the current candles and the leftover ones? Actually, we can burn all the candles we have (current + leftover) in one go.\n\n            # But wait, the problem doesn't specify that we must burn one candle at a time, but we can only use the candles we have. We can burn as many as we have.\n\n            # However, the process is: we have a stock of candles (both new and old that we have saved). We burn all of them (so we use the entire stock) and then we get as many old candles as the total burned.\n\n            # Then we use the old candles to make new ones.\n\n            # So:\n\n            # Burn all: total_burned = current + leftover\n            # Then, total hours increases by total_burned.\n\n            # Now, we have total_burned old candles.\n\n            # Then, we can make new_candles = total_burned // b\n            # And leftover_old = total_burned % b\n\n            # Then, set current = new_candles, and leftover = leftover_old.\n\n            # Then, repeat until current and leftover are zero.\n\n        Example with a=4, b=2:\n\n            Iteration1:\n                current = 4, leftover = 0\n                total_burned = 4\n                hours = 4\n                new_candles = 4//2 = 2, leftover_old = 0\n                current = 2, leftover = 0\n\n            Iteration2:\n                total_burned = 2\n                hours = 6\n                new_candles = 2//2 = 1, leftover_old = 0\n                current = 1, leftover = 0\n\n            Iteration3:\n                total_burned = 1\n                hours = 7\n                new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover_old = 1\n                current = 0, leftover = 1\n\n            Iteration4:\n                total_burned = 1 (since current=0, leftover=1)\n                hours = 8\n                new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover_old = 1\n                Then we break because after this iteration, current=0 and leftover=1, and then we check: current>0 or leftover>0 -> yes, so we do one more? Actually, wait, we are burning the leftover in iteration4, then we get 1 old candle, and then we try to make new ones: 1//2=0, and leftover=1, so same as before.\n\n            But wait, the example output is 7. Why did we get 8?\n\n        What's the issue? In the example, after burning the first 4, we have 4 old. Then we make 2 new. Then we burn those 2, then we have 2 old, which makes 1 new. Then we burn that 1, and then we have 1 old. Now, we cannot make a new candle from 1 old because we need 2. So the total hours should be 4 (first burn) + 2 (second) + 1 (third) = 7.\n\n        But in our simulation, we did burn the leftover in the fourth iteration, meaning we burned that last old candle? But that old candle was already burned? Actually, no: the old candle was created from the burning of the last new candle. The process is:\n\n            Hour 1-4: burn the initial 4 -> 4 hours, and we have 4 old.\n            Then, from 4 old, we make 2 new. Then we can burn these 2 new -> 2 hours (total 6), and we have 2 old.\n            Then, from 2 old, we make 1 new. Then we burn that 1 -> 1 hour (total 7), and we have 1 old.\n            Now, we cannot make a new candle from 1 old, so we stop.\n\n        But in the simulation above, we are burning the leftover old candles separately. However, the leftover old candles are not burned until we decide to use them. But note: the problem says that we can use the old candles to make new ones, and then burn the new ones. The old candles themselves are not burned until we run out of new ones and we use them as part of the stock.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not say that we have to burn old candles. We can accumulate old candles and then use them to make new ones, but we don't burn the old ones until we have no new ones and we use the old ones as if they were new? No, wait: the problem states that when you light a candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. But the act of making a new candle from old ones doesn't require burning the old ones. The old ones are just materials.\n\n        However, in the problem statement, the example says: \"then he uses four burned out candles to make two new candles and lights them up\". This implies that the burned out candles (old) are used to make new candles, and then the new candles are burned. \n\n        The key point: we don't burn the old candles again. We only burn the new ones (the ones we have initially and the ones we make from old). The old candles are just waste until we combine enough to make a new one.\n\n        Therefore, we should not be burning the old candles that we are saving for recycling. We only burn the new candles.\n\n        So the process is:\n\n            We start with 'a' new candles and 0 old.\n            We burn the 'a' new candles -> a hours, and then we have a old.\n            Then, we use the old to make floor(a/b) new candles, and the remaining old is a % b.\n\n            Then, we have floor(a/b) new candles and a % b old.\n\n            Then, we burn the floor(a/b) new candles -> floor(a/b) hours, and then we have floor(a/b) old from these, plus the leftover a % b, so total old = (a % b) + floor(a/b)\n\n            Then, we make new candles from the total old: floor((a % b + floor(a/b)) / b) and leftover old = (a % b + floor(a/b)) % b.\n\n        So the simulation should not include burning the leftover old candles. Only the new candles are burned.\n\n        Therefore, the above simulation that uses:\n\n            total_burned = current + leftover   [this is wrong because we shouldn't burn the leftover old candles]\n\n        We must separate the new candles from the old ones.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                # Burn all the new candles\n                total_hours += new\n                # These new candles become old\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n        But wait, in the example:\n\n            Start: new=4, old=0\n            First iteration:\n                total_hours = 4\n                old = 4\n                new = 4 // 2 = 2\n                old = 4 % 2 = 0\n\n            Second iteration:\n                total_hours = 4+2 = 6\n                old = 2\n                new = 2 // 2 = 1\n                old = 2 % 2 = 0\n\n            Third iteration:\n                total_hours = 6+1 = 7\n                old = 1\n                new = 1 // 2 = 0\n                old = 1 % 2 = 1\n\n            Then we break because new==0.\n\n            This gives 7, which is correct.\n\n        However, note that the leftover old candles (1) are not burned. They remain as waste.\n\n        But wait, what if we have both new and old candles? Actually, in the problem, we are allowed to use the old candles only to make new ones, and we burn the new ones. We don't burn the old ones. So the simulation above is correct.\n\n        But consider another example: a=6, b=3 (from the sample input)\n\n            Input: \"6 3\" -> Output: \"8\"\n\n            Simulation:\n\n            new=6, old=0\n            First iteration:\n                total_hours += 6 -> 6\n                old += 6 -> 6\n                new = 6 // 3 = 2\n                old = 6 % 3 = 0\n\n            Second iteration:\n                total_hours += 2 -> 8\n                old += 2 -> 2\n                new = 2 // 3 = 0\n                old = 2 % 3 = 2\n\n            Then break.\n\n            So total_hours=8, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we have old candles from previous iterations and new candles? The above simulation only uses the new candles and then recycles the old ones. However, the problem allows us to use the old candles (that we have saved) along with the new ones? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" So whenever we have b old candles, we can make one new. And we can do this repeatedly.\n\n        But note: the process of burning the new candles produces old ones, and we can use all old ones (whether from previous recycling or from the current burning) to make new ones.\n\n        However, the above simulation does not combine the old candles from multiple cycles. It does: because after burning the new candles, we immediately use the total old (which is the sum of the old from the previous cycle and the current burned ones) to make new ones.\n\n        But wait, in the simulation, we set old = old % b, and then we set new = old // b. Then we add the new to the next cycle's new candles.\n\n        However, what if we have old candles from previous cycles that we didn't use? The simulation accumulates the old candles from the burning and then uses them to make new ones.\n\n        But note: the above code does:\n\n            old += new   (from the current burning)\n            then sets new = old // b, and old = old % b.\n\n        This means that we are converting all the old candles (from the previous cycle and the current burning) to new ones.\n\n        But is that correct? Yes, because the problem doesn't specify any limit on how many old candles we can use at once.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            total = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n            print(total)\n\n        However, let me test with a different example: a=10, b=5\n\n            First iteration:\n                new=10, total=10, old=10\n                new = 10//5 = 2, old=0\n            Second iteration:\n                total=12, old=2, new=2//5=0, old=2\n            Then we break. Total=12.\n\n        Let's compute manually:\n\n            Initially, 10 new -> burn 10, then we have 10 old. From 10 old, we make 2 new (since 10/5=2). Then we burn 2, so total 12. Then we have 2 old, which is not enough for a new candle. So 12 hours.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait, what if b=4, a=7?\n\n            First: burn 7 -> total=7, old=7\n            Then, new = 7//4 = 1, old=7%4=3\n            Then, burn 1 -> total=8, old=1+3=4\n            Then, new=4//4=1, old=0\n            Then, burn 1 -> total=9, old=1\n            Then, break.\n\n            So total=9.\n\n        Let's verify:\n\n            Hour1-7: burn 7 candles -> 7 hours, and we have 7 old.\n            Then, from 7 old, we make 1 new (using 4 old) and leave 3 old.\n            Then, burn 1 -> 8th hour, and we have 1 old from that + 3 old = 4 old.\n            Then, from 4 old, we make 1 new.\n            Then, burn 1 -> 9th hour, and we have 1 old.\n            Then, we cannot make a new candle.\n\n            So 9 hours.\n\n        The code produces 9.\n\n        However, note that the problem says: \"for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well?\"\n\n        The above simulation is optimal because we burn all the new candles we have at every step.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read a and b\n            Initialize:\n                total = 0\n                new = a\n                old = 0\n\n            While new > 0:\n                total += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n            Print(total)\n\n        But wait, what if we have leftover old candles at the beginning? The problem says we start with a new candles and no old ones.\n\n        However, we can also consider that we might have old candles from previous cycles, and we are accumulating them.\n\n        This algorithm is efficient because the number of iterations is logarithmic in a (base roughly b).\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem input is two integers in one line.\n\n        Example inputs: ['4 2', '6 3'] -> outputs ['7','8']\n\n        We'll read the input:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n        Then run the simulation.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: a=4, b=2 -> 7\n        Example2: a=6, b=3 -> 8\n\n        Code:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n            print(total)\n\n        This should work.\n\n        But wait, there's an alternative solution that uses a formula. However, the iterative method is straightforward and efficient for the constraints (a, b between 1 and 1000).\n\n        Let me run the example a=4, b=2:\n\n            new=4, old=0\n            total=4, old=4\n            new=4//2=2, old=0\n            total=6, old=2\n            new=2//2=1, old=0\n            total=7, old=1\n            new=1//2=0, old=1 -> loop ends.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        One more: a=1, b=2 -> \n            new=1, old=0\n            total=1, old=1\n            new=1//2=0, old=1 -> loop ends.\n            Output: 1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another: a=2, b=2 -> \n            new=2, old=0\n            total=2, old=2\n            new=2//2=1, old=0\n            total=3, old=1\n            new=0 -> done. Output=3.\n\n        Manually: \n            Two candles: burn 2 -> 2 hours, then from 2 old we make 1 new -> burn 1 -> total 3, then 1 old left. Correct.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, note that the problem says that b>=2, so no division by zero.\n\n        Let's submit this code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for an hour and then becomes an old candle. These old candles can be combined to create new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero old candles. The total hours burned will be zero initially.\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available new candles. The number of hours increases by the number of new candles burned.\n3. **Recycling Old Candles**: After burning, the old candles (from the current burn plus any leftovers from previous cycles) are used to create new candles. Specifically, every `b` old candles can be converted into one new candle.\n4. **Update Variables**: The new candles created are added to the pool for the next iteration, while the remaining old candles (those not enough to form a new candle) are kept as leftovers.\n5. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no new candles left to burn. The total hours accumulated during the process is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling the leftovers, ensuring optimal usage of all available candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    new = a\n    old = 0\n\n    while new > 0:\n        total += new\n        old += new\n        new = old // b\n        old = old % b\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of new candles) and `b` (number of old candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` keeps track of the total hours the room is lit. `new` holds the number of new candles available for burning, and `old` holds the leftover old candles from previous cycles.\n3. **Loop Until No New Candles**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles to burn. In each iteration:\n   - **Burning Phase**: The current `new` candles are burned, adding their count to `total`.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The burned candles become old. The total old candles (`old`) are used to create new candles (`old // b`), and the remainder (`old % b`) becomes the new leftover.\n4. **Output**: Once no new candles are left, the loop exits, and the total hours (`total`) is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible candles are utilized optimally, maximizing the burning time by recycling old candles whenever possible. The algorithm efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, providing the correct result for any valid input.",
