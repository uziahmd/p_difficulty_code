Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S (in Morse code).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that the Morse code strings for letters are of length 1 to 4, and there are 30 possible binary strings (with '0' for dot and '1' for dash) of length 1 to 4, but four of them (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") are invalid.\n\n 2. The problem is: after each append of a character (either '0' or '1') to S, we need to count the number of distinct sequences of English letters that appear as contiguous substrings (in Morse code) in S.\n\n However, note: the example output for \"111\" is 7, which corresponds to the set:\n   { \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" }\n\n But wait: the example says:\n   \"T\" -> \"1\"\n   \"M\" -> \"11\"\n   \"O\" -> \"111\"\n\n Then the sequences are built by concatenating these letters. However, note that the substring \"11\" appears twice: once as the second letter (if we break \"111\" into two letters? Actually, the substring \"11\" can be the Morse code for \"M\", and also the substring \"11\" at the beginning is part of \"TT\" (which is two T's). Similarly, \"111\" can be broken as \"M\" followed by \"T\" (MT) or \"T\" followed by \"M\" (TM) or even three T's (TTT) or just one M and then a T? Actually, the problem says: the sequences of English letters. Each contiguous substring of S (which is a string of 0s and 1s) must be interpreted as a sequence of Morse code strings (each of length 1 to 4) that form a valid word.\n\n But note: the substring \"11\" can be broken in two ways? Actually, the problem states: \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\n How do we interpret a substring? The substring is a sequence of bits. We must split it into consecutive valid Morse code letters (each of length 1 to 4). However, the splitting must be such that every consecutive segment of 1 to 4 bits is a valid letter, and the entire substring is partitioned without gaps.\n\n However, note: the example does not require that the entire substring is broken only in one way. But actually, the same substring might be broken in multiple ways? For example, \"111\" can be broken as:\n   - [1,1,1] -> T, T, T -> \"TTT\"\n   - [11,1] -> M, T -> \"MT\"\n   - [1,11] -> T, M -> \"TM\"\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\". So we are counting distinct sequences of letters (words) that can be formed by some substring, and the same word (sequence of letters) might be formed by multiple substrings? Actually, the problem says \"that are represented\", so if the same sequence of letters appears from two different substrings, we count it only once? Or multiple times?\n\n Let's read the problem: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\n\n This suggests that we are to count distinct sequences (words) that can be obtained from any substring of S (by breaking the substring into consecutive valid Morse code representations). However, note that the example counts 7 distinct words from the substring \"111\": \n   { \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" }\n\n But note: the word \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\", which is also used to represent \"M\" (so two different words from the same substring \"11\"). However, the problem is counting distinct words. So:\n\n   From \"1\": we get the word \"T\".\n   From \"11\": we can get \"TT\" (if we break as two T's) and \"M\" (if we break as one M). But wait, the substring \"11\" has two possible breaks? However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\", meaning we consider every valid splitting of the substring into consecutive valid Morse code letters.\n\n But note: the example output counts the distinct words (sequences of letters) that appear. So \"TT\" is one word (two T's), and \"M\" is one word. However, the substring \"11\" can produce two different",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by interpreting substrings of a given binary string (composed of '0's and '1's) as Morse code representations. The Morse code here uses '0' for dots and '1' for dashes, with each letter represented by a string of length 1 to 4. Not all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 correspond to valid letters; specifically, the strings \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\" are invalid.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any substring of the binary string `S` must be split into consecutive segments, each representing a valid English letter (i.e., a binary string of length 1 to 4 that is not one of the four invalid strings). The challenge is to efficiently track all valid sequences (words) formed by these splits after each modification to `S`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string. This helps in efficiently counting new valid sequences as we process each character.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each new character appended to `S`, we check all possible valid splits ending at the current position. If a substring ending at the current position forms a valid letter, we update the DP state by considering sequences that include this letter.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each character in linear time relative to the length of the string, making it efficient for the given constraints (up to 3000 characters).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    valid_letters = [bin(i)[2:].zfill(1:4] for i in range(1 << 1, 1 << 4)]\n    valid_letters_set = set(valid_letters)\n    invalid_strings = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n    valid_letters_set = {x for x in valid_letters if x not in invalid_strings}\n    valid_letters_set = sorted(valid_letters_set, key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True)\n\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    ans = [0] * (m + 1)\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        char = s_list[i-1]\n        new_dp = dp[:] \n        new_ans = ans[i-1]\n        for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(j-1, i))\n            if len(substr) > 4:\n                break\n            if substr in valid_letters_set:\n                if j == 1:\n                    new_dp[i] += 1\n                else:\n                    new_dp[i] = (new_dp[i] + dp[j-1]) % MOD\n                new_ans = (new_ans + dp[j-1] + 1) % MOD\n        dp[i] = new_dp[i]\n        ans[i] = new_ans\n        print(new_ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes necessary variables, including the list of valid Morse code strings (excluding the invalid ones).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string. The `ans` array stores the cumulative count of valid sequences up to each position.\n\n3. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position. If a substring is a valid Morse code letter, it updates the DP state by considering sequences that include this letter.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the code prints the total number of distinct valid sequences found so far, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
