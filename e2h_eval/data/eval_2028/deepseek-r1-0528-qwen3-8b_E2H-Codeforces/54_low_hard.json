Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices, from 3 to 10^5) and a (the target angle, from 1 to 180 degrees).\n\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from the regular convex n-gon) such that the angle formed by the two sides (v1-v2 and v3-v2) is as close as possible to 'a'. The angle is measured in degrees.\n\n Important: The polygon is regular and convex, with vertices numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n How do we think?\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n Consider an angle at vertex v2. We can consider two rays from v2 to other two vertices, say v1 and v3.\n\n However, note: the problem allows any three distinct vertices. But the polygon is regular so the angles we can form are determined by the steps (arc lengths) between the vertices.\n\n Observation:\n In a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex between two other vertices can be calculated using the inscribed angle or by using the tangent rule? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n The entire circle is 360 degrees. The polygon is regular, so the vertices lie equally spaced on a circle.\n\n The angle at vertex v2 (which is not the center) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc between v1 and v3.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the triangle formed by the three points. But note: the problem does not require the triangle to be formed by consecutive edges, but the angle must have v2 as the vertex and the sides going along the polygon's edges? Actually, no: the sides of the angle are just two rays from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle we are measuring is the one at v2.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 67\" (square) leads to an answer of 45 degrees being chosen. Why? Because the square has two types of angles: 45 and 90.\n\n Actually, let's compute for a square (n=4). The central angle is 90 degrees. The angle at a vertex for two adjacent vertices (like 90 degree turn) is 90 degrees. But wait, what is the angle we are measuring?\n\n Let me clarify: In the square, if we take three consecutive vertices (say 1,2,3) then the angle at vertex 2 is 90 degrees. If we take two non-adjacent vertices (like 1,2,4) then the angle at vertex 2 is 45 degrees? Actually, wait: the square's vertices are labeled 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). Then the angle at vertex 2 for the two sides to vertex 1 and vertex 3 is 90 degrees. But if we take the two sides from vertex 2 to vertex 1 and vertex 4, then the angle is 45 degrees? Actually, let me draw:\n\n Vertex 1,2,3,4 (square) in clockwise order.\n\n From vertex 2, we can go to:\n   - vertex 1: which is one step counterclockwise (if we consider the square, the edge from 2 to 1 is present, but also we can consider the diagonal from 2 to 4? Actually, the problem says distinct vertices, so we can choose any three.\n\n But note: the problem says \"three distinct vertices\", so we can choose any three.\n\n However, the polygon is convex, so the angle at vertex 2 can be either the interior angle (if we take two adjacent edges) or an angle formed by two edges that are not necessarily adjacent.\n\n Actually, the problem states: the angle is formed by two sides (v1-v2 and v2-v3). This angle is the angle between the two vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n In a convex polygon, the interior angle at a vertex is fixed (for a regular polygon) and is (n-2)*180/n. But note: the problem does not require the angle to be the interior angle. We can form an angle that is less than 180 degrees (since it's a convex polygon, the angle we form must be less than 180).\n\n How to compute the angle?\n\n We can use the fact that the polygon is cyclic (vertices lie on a circle). Then the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. The inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of the angle is half the measure of the arc between the two points (v1 and v3) that the angle subtends.\n\n However, note: there are two arcs between v1 and v3: the minor and the major. The inscribed angle will use the minor",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking potential angles without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex polygon, the angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices can be determined using the central angles between those vertices. The angle at vertex \\( v2 \\) between vertices \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc between \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\). The measure of this angle is half the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n2. **Insight**: For a regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is \\( 360^\\circ / n \\). The angle between two vertices separated by \\( k \\) steps is \\( 360^\\circ \\times k / n \\). The inscribed angle at a vertex for these two points is half the difference of the arcs they subtend, but since the polygon is convex, we consider the minor arc.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which would be computationally expensive for large \\( n \\)), we recognize that the closest angle will either be the interior angle of the polygon or an angle derived from the polygon's structure. We calculate the interior angle and then check angles formed by vertices separated by small steps (1 to floor(n/2) steps) to find the minimal difference from the target angle.\n\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating over possible step counts and calculating the corresponding angles, we can efficiently determine the closest angle without exhaustive checks. This reduces the complexity from \\( O(n^3) \\) to \\( O(n) \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    interior_angle = 180 - 360/n\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    if abs(a - interior_angle) < best_diff:\n        best_diff = abs(a - interior_angle)\n        best_vertices = [n, 1, n-1]\n        \n    for k in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        angle = 360 * k / n\n        if angle > 180:\n            break\n        inscribed_angle = 180 - 2 * (angle / 2)\n        diff = abs(a - inscribed_angle)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = [k+1, 1, n - k]\n            \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, \\( n \\) (number of vertices) and \\( a \\) (target angle).\n2. **Interior Angle Calculation**: The interior angle of the polygon is calculated as \\( 180 - 360/n \\). This is a candidate angle to compare with the target.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Angles**: For each possible step count \\( k \\) (from 1 to \\( n/2 \\)), compute the central angle and the corresponding inscribed angle. The inscribed angle is derived from the central angle using the relationship between inscribed and central angles in a circle.\n4. **Finding the Best Match**: The algorithm keeps track of the smallest difference between the computed angles and the target angle. The vertices corresponding to the best match are stored and printed.\n5. **Output**: The three vertices that form the angle closest to the target are printed. If multiple solutions exist, any valid triplet is acceptable.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging geometric properties, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
