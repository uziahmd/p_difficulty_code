The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners that were double counted? Actually, the standard formula for the border of an n x m grid is 2*(n+m-2) for the inner part? Let me think differently.\n\n Alternatively, note that the ring is the set of cells that are at the border of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size n x m is:\n   If n==1 or m==1, then it's just n*m (but our rectangles are at least 3x3 initially, and then decreasing by multiples of 4). However, we are told that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3 (if k>=1, then the first ring uses w and h, then the next uses w-4 and h-4, etc.)\n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: 3 3 1 -> Output: 8\n   The border of a 3x3 grid: \n        There are 3*3 = 9 cells, but the border is the outer ring. The inner part is 1x1 (the center) so the border has 8 cells.\n\n How to compute the border of a rectangle of size n x m?\n   The border consists of:\n      top row: n\n      bottom row: n\n      left side (excluding the top and bottom): (m-2)\n      right side (excluding the top and bottom): (m-2)\n\n   So total border cells: 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n   Alternatively, the entire rectangle has n*m cells, and the inner rectangle (if n>=2 and m>=2) would be (n-2)*(m-2) cells, so the border is n*m - (n-2)*(m-2) = 4*(n+m-2).\n\n   Let me check: 3x3: 3*3 = 9, inner rectangle is 1x1 -> 9 - 1 = 8, and 4*(3+3-2)=4*4=16? That doesn't match.\n\n   Actually, the inner rectangle for the border is not the same as the next ring's outer rectangle. In fact, the ring is the outer layer. The formula for the border (perimeter) of an n x m grid is 2*(n+m-2) for the inner part? No, wait:\n\n   We can break it down: \n        Top: n cells\n        Bottom: n cells\n        Left: m-2 (because the top and bottom are already taken)\n        Right: m-2\n\n   So total = n + n + (m-2) + (m-2) = 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula: perimeter = 2*(n + m) - 4.\n\n   Example: 3x3: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the i-th ring is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   Therefore, the number of cells in the i-th ring is: \n        ring_i = 2 * [ (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) ] - 4\n                = 2*(w+h - 8*(i-1)) - 4\n                = 2*(w+h) - 16*(i-1) - 4\n\n   However, let",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate based on the given parameters. The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns, and we are required to add `k` concentric rings of gilding. Each ring starts from the outer edge and moves inward by 2 cells for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each ring's border can be computed using the dimensions of the rectangle it encircles. For the i-th ring, the rectangle size is `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in the border (ring) of this rectangle is given by the formula `2*(length + width) - 4`, which simplifies to `2*(w + h - 8*(i-1)) - 4`.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each of the `k` rings, computing the number of cells for each ring using the derived formula, and summing these values to get the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of rings. Since k is constrained to be at most floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4), the solution is efficient and handles the input constraints effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        side_length = 4 * (i - 1)\n        new_w = w - side_length\n        new_h = h - side_length\n        if new_w <= 0 or new_h <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (new_w + new_h) - 4\n        total += ring_cells\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` from standard input, representing the dimensions of the plate and the number of rings to be applied.\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to zero to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Calculate the effective dimensions of the rectangle after subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both `w` and `h` (since each ring moves inward by 2 cells on each side).\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, the loop breaks as further rings would not fit.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula `2*(new_w + new_h) - 4`.\n   - Add this value to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of cells to be gilded is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by handling edge cases where rings might not fit within the plate dimensions.",
