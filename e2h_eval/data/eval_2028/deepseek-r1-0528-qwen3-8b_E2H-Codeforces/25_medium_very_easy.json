При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string t (length up to 100) and we need to check if it is possible that t was formed by:\n   - Two consecutive transmissions of the same message s, but with an error that caused an overlap.\n Conditions for the error:\n   - The two messages are identical (so s+s would normally be the expected without error, but here there's an overlap).\n   - The overlapping part must be positive and less than the length of s.\n\n Additionally, note:\n   - If the entire string t is exactly two copies of s (i.e., no overlap) then that is not considered an error.\n   - The problem states: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений\" — meaning that if the entire second message is overlapped (so t = s), then that is not considered an error? Actually, let me re-read:\n\n But note: the example says that if you get \"abcd\", then no error. Similarly, \"abcabc\" has no error.\n\n However, the problem says: \"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно.\" and the overlapping condition is that the end of the first and the beginning of the second must match, and the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n So, we are looking for a decomposition of t as:\n   t = A + B, where A is the first s (possibly partially overlapped) and B is the second s (also possibly partially overlapped) but with an overlap in the middle.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the two messages are identical, and the error causes the end of the first to merge with the beginning of the second. So the entire t is built from two copies of s, but with some overlap at the junction.\n\n How can we represent t?\n   Let n = len(t). We are to check if there exists a string s such that:\n        t = s + s[overlap_length:]   and the overlap is positive and less than len(s).\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   t must be of the form: \n        t = x + y, where x is a prefix of s and y is a suffix of s, and the overlap (the part that was merged) is the last |x| characters of the first s and the first |x| of the second s, and |x| is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\n But note: the entire process is two transmissions of the same s. So the total length of t is at least 2*len(s) - overlap_length, and the overlap_length is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n Another way: \n   Let the original two messages be s and s. Then the transmitted string is:\n        t = s[0: len(s)-overlap] + s[overlap:]\n\n And the condition is that the last 'overlap' characters of s must equal the first 'overlap' characters of s.\n\n Also note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s with an overlap of exactly 'overlap'. \n\n But note: the problem says the error might have occurred only once. So the entire string t is the result of one such merge.\n\n Observation:\n   We can try to consider that t must have a prefix which is also a suffix (with the same length) and the rest of the string is the remaining part of s.\n\n However, note: the example \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n        s = \"abrakadabra\", then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1? Actually, wait: \n        Without error: two messages would be \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\". With error and an overlap of 5 (as in the example): \n        They said: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> this is 25 letters, and s is 11. Then 11 + 11 - 5 = 17? That doesn't add up.\n\n Let me recount: \n        Original s: \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n        With an overlap of 5: the first s is sent completely, then the second s starts at the 5th character from the end of the first s. \n        So the merged string is: \n            First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Second s: from the 5th character (index 6? because the first s ends at index 10, so we take from index 5 to the end? Actually, the example says: \n            In the first example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> the first part is \"abrakadabra\" and the second part starts at the 5th character of the first s? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"abrakadabra\" and then \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1: becomes \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (here, the last 'a' of the first and the first 'a' of the second merge, so the merged string is 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? But the example says 21: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" has 21 letters.\n\n        How did they get 21? \n            Original two messages: \"abrakadabra\" (11) and \"abrakadabra\" (11) -> without error: 22 letters.\n            With error and overlap of 1: 11 + 10 = 21.\n\n        So the condition: the merged string is of length (len(s) + len(s) - overlap) = 2 * len(s) - overlap.\n\n        Now, what is the structure of t?\n            t = s[0: len(s)-overlap] + s[overlap:]\n\n        But note: the first s is sent completely, then the second s is sent from the (overlap)th character to the end.\n\n        Alternatively, we can say that t is composed of two parts: \n            Let n = len(s). Then the string t must satisfy:\n                t[0: n] = s\n                and the last (n - overlap) characters of t must be equal to the first (n - overlap) of s? Actually, no.\n\n        Actually, the entire second s is being merged with the first. The merging happens at the boundary: the last 'overlap' characters of the first s must equal the first 'overlap' of the second s.\n\n        Therefore, the entire string t is: \n            t = s + (s[overlap:])   [without repeating the overlapping part]\n\n        But note: the first s is entirely included, and then the second s is appended without the overlapping part. So the total length is n + (n - overlap) = 2*n - overlap.\n\n        Now, we know the entire t. We don't know s. But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So s is the same for both.\n\n        Conditions on t:\n          There exists an integer k (overlap) such that 1 <= k < n, and \n          t[0:n] == s, and t[n-k:] == s[k:], and the length of t is 2*n - k.\n\n        But note: we don't know n (the length of s). However, we know that the entire string t must be broken into two parts: the first n characters and the rest, but the rest is also determined by the overlap.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over possible n (the length of s). Since the length of t is L, then n must be at least ceil(L/2) and at most ...? Actually, from the equation: \n          L = 2*n - k, and k is between 1 and n-1, so n must be at least ceil((L+1)/2) and at most floor(L/2)*2 + something? Actually, n must be greater than k, and k>=1, so n>=ceil((L+1)/2)? \n\n        Actually, from the equation: n = (L + k) / 2, and since k>=1 and k<=n-1, then n must be at least (L+1)//2 and at most (L-1)//2? Wait, let me solve for n:\n\n        We have: L = 2*n - k, and 1<=k<=n-1.\n        => k = 2*n - L, and 1 <= 2*n - L <= n-1.\n\n        Then: \n          2*n - L >= 1  => n >= (L+1)/2\n          2*n - L <= n-1 => n <= L-1\n\n        But note: n must be an integer and also the entire string t must be built from two copies of s of length n.\n\n        However, we can also note that the entire string t must satisfy: \n          The first n characters is s, and the substring from index n-k to the end (which is of length n - k) must equal s[k:].\n\n        But also, the entire t must be: \n          t = s + s[k:]\n\n        Therefore, the string t must be equal to: \n          t = s + s[k:]\n\n        And the condition on s is that the first n-k characters of s (if we break s into two parts: the non-overlapping part and the overlapping part) must be the first n-k of t, and then the next k characters (the overlapping part) must be the same as the first k of s, and then the rest is s without the first k.\n\n        But note: we don't know s. However, we can use the fact that the entire t is built from two copies of s with an overlap of k.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We are allowed to output any valid s if there is more than one. So we can try to find at least one n (the length of s) that satisfies the conditions.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let L = len(t)\n\n        Condition 1: There must exist an integer n (length of s) such that:\n            n >= ceil((L+1)/2) and n <= L-1   [from above: n >= (L+1)/2 and n <= L-1? Actually, from k=2*n-L and k<=n-1: n <= L-1 is correct, and n>=ceil((L+1)/2)]\n\n        But wait: the equation: L = 2*n - k, and k must be at least 1, so n >= (L+1)/2. Also, k<=n-1 -> 2*n-L <= n-1 -> n <= L-1.\n\n        Then, for each candidate n (which is an integer from ceil((L+1)/2) to L-1):\n\n            k = 2*n - L   (must be between 1 and n-1, which is guaranteed by our range of n)\n\n            Then, we require:\n                s = t[0:n]   (the first n characters)\n                and the remainder of the string from n to the end must be equal to t[n:] should be equal to s[k:].\n\n            But note: the total length of t is L, so the second part (the non-overlapping part of the second s) is from index n to the end, which is of length L - n = (2*n - L) - n? Actually, L = 2*n - k, so L - n = n - k.\n\n            And s[k:] is also of length n - k. So we require:\n                t[n:] == s[k:]\n\n            But s is t[0:n], so s[k:] is t[k: n] ??? Wait, no: s = t[0:n], so s[k:] is t[k: n] only if k<n? Actually, yes, but then we are comparing t[n:] to t[k:n]?\n\n            Example: \n                t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", L=21, n=11, then k=2*11-21=1.\n                Then s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then we require t[11:] == s[1:] -> \"brabrkadabra\" (from index 11 to 20) must equal \"brakadabra\"? \n                But \"brabrkadabra\" != \"brakadabra\"\n\n            Wait, that doesn't match. \n\n        Let me reexamine the structure:\n\n        According to the problem: \n            The two messages are s and s. The first is sent entirely, then the second is sent from the (overlap)th character to the end. So the merged string is:\n                t = s + s[overlap:]\n\n            Therefore, the length is n + (n - overlap) = 2*n - overlap.\n\n            Then the second part (after the first n characters) should be the substring of s starting at index 'overlap' (not the first n characters, but the entire s is n long, so the second part is s[overlap:] which is from index 'overlap' to the end of s, which is n - overlap characters.\n\n            But note: our string t has length L = 2*n - overlap.\n\n            Then, in t, the first n characters is s. Then the next part is of length n - overlap, which is s[overlap:].\n\n            However, note that the first n characters of t is s, and then the next n - overlap characters is s[overlap:].\n\n            But the entire t is built from two copies of s with an overlap of 'overlap', so the entire t is:\n\n                t = s[0: n] + s[overlap: n]\n\n            But note: the second copy of s is only partially sent (from the 'overlap' index to the end). \n\n            Therefore, the entire t is:\n\n                t = s[0: n] + s[overlap: n]\n\n            Then, the length of t is n + (n - overlap) = 2*n - overlap.\n\n            Now, how to relate the indices of t?\n\n            The first n characters: indices 0 to n-1.\n            Then the next part: indices n to n + (n - overlap) - 1.\n\n            And we require that the substring t[n: n+(n-overlap)] equals s[overlap:].\n\n            But s is t[0:n]. So we require:\n\n                t[n: n + (n - overlap)] == t[overlap: n]\n\n            However, note: the length of the second part is (n - overlap) and the length of t[overlap: n] is (n - overlap). So we require:\n\n                t[n: n + (n - overlap)] == t[overlap: n]\n\n            But note: the total length of t is 2*n - overlap, so the index n + (n - overlap) is exactly 2*n - overlap, which is the end of the string.\n\n            Now, we have two expressions for the same string t:\n\n                Condition: t[0:n] = s (by definition) and t[n: ] = s[overlap:].\n\n            But note: s[overlap:] is defined as the substring of s (which is t[0:n]) from index 'overlap' to the end. \n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                Condition: t[n:] == t[overlap: n]   (because s[overlap:] = t[overlap: n])\n\n            However, the length of t[n:] is (2*n - overlap) - n = n - overlap, and the length of t[overlap: n] is n - overlap, so they are of the same length.\n\n        Example with \"abrakadabra\" (n=11) and overlap=1 (k=1):\n\n            t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (length 21)\n            Condition: \n                t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n                t[11:] = \"brakadabra\" (from index 11 to 20, which is 10 characters)\n                t[overlap:11] = t[1:11] = \"brakadabra\"\n\n            So we require: \"brakadabra\" == \"brakadabra\" -> true.\n\n        So the condition is: \n            Let n be a candidate (from ceil((L+1)/2) to L-1) and k = 2*n - L (which must be between 1 and n-1, and by our range it is). Then:\n\n            Condition1: t[0:n] is the first copy of s.\n            Condition2: t[n:] == t[k:n]\n\n        Then, we can set s = t[0:n] and the entire t is built by the error.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical, and the error condition is met. Also, note that the problem allows multiple s, so we can choose the smallest n? Or any n? We just need to output one.\n\n        However, note: the example input ['acacacaca'] is given and the output is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n        Let's test with t = \"acacacaca\", and s = \"acaca\" (n=5). Then L=9, so k=2*5-9=1.\n\n        Condition: \n            t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n            t[5:] = \"caca\" (from index5 to 8: 4 characters)\n            t[1:5] = \"cacac\" -> wait, that's 4 characters? Actually, from index1 to index4 (inclusive) is \"cacac\"? No, wait: \n            Actually, in Python, slicing: t[1:5] is from index1 to index4 (5 excluded). So for \"acacacaca\":\n                t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n                t[1:5] = \"cacac\" -> but wait, the string is \"acacacaca\": \n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'c'\n                    index2: 'a'\n                    index3: 'c'\n                    index4: 'a'\n                    index5: 'c'\n                    index6: 'a'\n                    index7: 'c'\n                    index8: 'a'\n\n                So t[1:5] = \"caca\" (because from index1 to index4: 'c','a','c','a') -> actually, wait: \n                t[1:5] = t[1] to t[4] -> that's 4 characters: indices 1,2,3,4 -> 'c','a','c','a'\n\n            Then condition: t[5:] = t[5:9] = \"caca\" (because from index5 to 8: 'c','a','c','a') and t[1:5]=\"caca\", so condition holds.\n\n            But wait, the example output is \"acaca\", which is s of length 5.\n\n        However, note: the example input was \"acacacaca\", and the example output was \"acaca\".\n\n        But wait, the example input list also includes \"acacacaca\", and the expected output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n        But note: there might be multiple n. For example, we could also consider n=9? Then k=2*9-9=9, but then k must be less than n? Actually, k=9 and n=9 -> k must be < n, so invalid. \n\n        What about n=6? Then k=2*6-9=3, which is between 1 and 5 (valid). Then:\n            s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n            Condition: t[6:] should be t[3:6] -> t[6:9] = \"aca\", and t[3:6] = \"cac\", which are not equal.\n\n        What about n=4? Then k=2*4-9=-1 -> invalid.\n\n        So the candidate n must be at least ceil((9+1)/2)=5, so n=5 is the smallest and only candidate.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that if there is no error, then output \"NO\". But note: the condition for no error is that the entire string t is two copies of s without any overlap. That is, t = s+s, and then the length is 2*n, so k=0 (which is not allowed). \n\n        But wait: the problem says that the error condition requires an overlap (positive and less than the length). So if we have t = s+s, then there is no error? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" — meaning that if the entire second message is overlapped (so the entire second message is merged with the first, making t = s), then that is not considered an error. But note: that situation would be when k = n, then t = s + s[n:] = s + '' = s. So the entire second message is overlapped. However, the problem says that the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message, so k=n is not allowed (k must be less than n). \n\n        Therefore, if t = s+s (no error) then that does not meet the error condition (because we require an overlap, and the error condition requires an overlap of at least 1 and less than n). \n\n        But note: the problem says that if the entire second message is overlapped (k=n) then that is not considered an error. However, k=n is not allowed by the condition (k must be < n). So in the error condition, we require k from 1 to n-1.\n\n        Therefore, we are only considering cases with an actual merge (overlap) of at least 1 and less than n.\n\n        However, note: the example \"abcabc\": \n            Length L=6. \n            Candidate n: from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(7/2)=4 to 5 (since n<=5). \n            n=4: k=2*4-6=2 (valid). Then s=t[0:4]=\"abca\", and we require t[4:]==t[2:4] -> \"bc\" vs \"ca\" -> not equal.\n            n=5: k=2*5-6=4 (valid). Then s=t[0:5]=\"abcab\", and we require t[5:]==t[4:5] -> \"c\" vs \"b\" -> not equal.\n\n            So no candidate n found -> output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Steps:\n          Read t (string)\n\n          Let L = len(t)\n\n          If L == 0: then output \"NO\" (but the input is non-empty)\n\n          Let n_min = (L+1)//2   [ceiling division: (L+1)//2 is the ceiling of (L+1)/2? Actually, for even: (L+1)//2 = (2k+1)//2 = k (for odd L) and for even L: (even+1)//2 is (2k+1)//2 = k (floor) but wait: we need n>=ceil((L+1)/2). \n\n          Actually, n_min = (L+1+1)//2? Let me clarify: \n            We require n >= (L+1)/2. Since n is integer, we can set n_min = ceil((L+1)/2). \n\n          In Python, we can compute: \n            n_min = (L+1) // 2 + (1 if (L+1) % 2 != 0 else 0)   -> no, wait: ceil(a) = (a//1) if a is integer, else floor(a)+1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use: n_min = (L+1) // 2 \n          But wait: \n            For L=21: (21+1)//2 = 22//2=11 -> correct.\n            For L=9: (9+1)//2=10//2=5 -> correct.\n\n          Actually, (L+1)//2 is the ceiling of (L)/2? No, (L+1)//2 is the floor of (L+1)/2, which is the ceiling of L/2? \n\n          Let me check:\n            For even L: L=2k -> (2k+1)//2 = k, but ceil(2k/2)=k, so that's the same.\n            For odd L: L=2k+1 -> (2k+2)//2 = k+1, and ceil((2k+1)/2)=ceil(k+0.5)=k+1.\n\n          Actually, we need n >= (L+1)/2, so the smallest integer n is ceil((L+1)/2). But note: (L+1)/2 might be an integer or half. \n\n          However, note: we defined n_min = ceil((L+1)/2). But note: (L+1)//2 in integer division (floor division) is:\n\n            If L is even: (L+1)//2 = (2k+1)//2 = k (since 2k+1 is odd, floor((2k+1)/2)=k)\n            But we need ceil((L+1)/2) for even L: (2k+1)/2 -> ceil is k+0.5 -> but wait, we are taking ceil of (L+1)/2.\n\n          Actually, we want the smallest integer n such that n >= (L+1)/2. This is indeed ceil((L+1)/2). \n\n          How to compute ceil((L+1)/2) in Python for integer L? \n            We can use: (L+1+1)//2? \n\n          Alternatively, note: \n            n_min = (L+1) // 2 if (L+1) % 2 == 0 then (L+1)//2, else (L+1)//2 + 1? \n\n          Actually, we can use: \n            n_min = (L+1) // 2 \n          But wait: \n            For L=1: (1+1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct (n_min=1, then k=2*1-1=1 -> but k must be < n, so 1<1 is false -> so n=1 is invalid? Then we skip n=1. But wait, the condition for n: n must be at least ceil((1+1)/2)=1 and at most 0? -> no, so no candidate. \n\n          Actually, the condition for n: n from ceil((L+1)/2) to L-1. For L=1: ceil((2)/2)=1, and then n from 1 to 0 -> no candidate. So that's okay.\n\n          But wait: the formula for k: k = 2*n - L. For n=1 and L=1: k=1, but then k must be between 1 and n-1 (which is 0) -> invalid.\n\n          So we can simply iterate n from n_min to L-1 (both inclusive). \n\n          Steps:\n\n          For n in the range [ceil((L+1)/2), L-1] (both inclusive) such that 1 <= (2*n - L) <= n-1 (which is automatically satisfied by our n_min and n_max? Actually, we set n_min = ceil((L+1)/2) and n_max = L-1, and the condition 1<=k<=n-1 is equivalent to n_min <= n <= L-1, so we can iterate n from n_min to L-1.\n\n          Then, for each n:\n            k = 2*n - L\n            Check if t[0:n] + t[k:n] == t? Actually, we don't need to reconstruct, we already know the total length is 2*n - k = L (given). But we can check:\n\n            Condition: \n                t[0:n] is the first part.\n                t[n:] must equal t[k:n] (because the second part is s[k:], which is t[k:n])\n\n            However, note: the second part of t (from index n to the end) is of length L - n = (2*n - k) - n = n - k, and t[k:n] is of length n - k, so we can compare:\n\n                if t[n:] == t[k:n]:\n                    then we found a candidate.\n\n            Then we can set s = t[0:n] and break.\n\n          But note: there might be multiple n? The problem says: if there is an error, output any s. So we can break at the first n we find.\n\n          However, note: the example \"acacacaca\" had only one candidate (n=5). \n\n          But consider: t = \"abababab\", example input. Expected output: YES, and s = \"ababab\"\n\n          Let's break down \"abababab\": \n            L=8, so n_min = (8+1)//2 = 9//2 = 4 (floor division) -> 4, then n from 4 to 7.\n\n            n=4: k=2*4-8=0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). \n            n=5: k=2*5-8=2 -> valid (1<=2<=4). Then:\n                s = t[0:5] = \"ababa\"\n                Condition: t[5:]==\"bab\" and t[2:5]==\"aba\" -> \"bab\" != \"aba\", so no.\n            n=6: k=2*6-8=4 -> valid (1<=4<=5). Then:\n                s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n                Condition: t[6:]==\"ab\" and t[4:6]==\"ba\" -> \"ab\" != \"ba\", no.\n            n=7: k=2*7-8=6 -> valid (1<=6<=6) -> but wait, k must be < n, so 6<7 -> valid.\n                Condition: t[7:]==\"ab\" (actually, from index7: one character 'b')? \n                Wait, t=\"abababab\", so:\n                    t[0:7] = \"abababa\"\n                    t[7:] = \"b\"\n                    t[6:7] = \"a\"\n                Then condition: t[7:]==\"b\" and t[6:7]==\"a\" -> not equal.\n\n            But wait, the example output is \"YES\\nababab\", meaning that s=\"ababab\" is valid. \n\n            How? \n            The example says: \"abababab\" can be broken as:\n                s = \"ababab\", then the merged string is s + s[overlap:] with overlap=4.\n\n            Then the merged string is: \n                s[0:6] + s[4:6] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is the given t.\n\n            Now, let's check with n=6, k=4:\n                Condition: t[6:] should be equal to t[4:6] -> \n                t[6:] = \"ab\" (from index6 to 7: two characters? Actually, the length of t is 8, so from index6 to the end is two characters: indices6 and7 -> \"ab\")\n                t[4:6] = \"ab\" (from index4 to5: two characters: \"ab\")\n\n            So condition: \"ab\"==\"ab\" -> true.\n\n            Why did I say t[7:] earlier? I made a mistake: the condition is t[n:] == t[k:n]. Here, n=6, so t[6:] is from index6 to the end (index7) -> two characters: \"ab\". And t[k:n] = t[4:6] is two characters: \"ab\". \n\n            So the algorithm must use: \n                Condition: t[n:] == t[k:n]\n\n            But note: the length of t[n:] is L-n = 8-6=2, and the length of t[k:n] is n-k=6-4=2. \n\n            So we must compare the entire substring from n to the end with the substring from k to n.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            L = len(t)\n            n_min = (L+1) // 2   [This gives floor((L+1)/2). But note: we require n>=ceil((L+1)/2). However, note: \n                ceil((L+1)/2) = (L+1+1)//2 if (L+1) is even? Actually, we can use:\n                n_min = (L+1+1)//2   for ceiling? \n\n            Actually, we can use:\n                n_min = (L+1) // 2\n                But wait: \n                    For L=8: (8+1)//2 = 9//2=4 -> ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(4.5)=5? \n\n            Let me recast: \n                We require n >= (L+1)/2. For L=8, (8+1)/2=4.5, so n_min=5.\n\n            How to compute ceiling of (L+1)/2? \n                ceil((L+1)/2) = (L+1+1)//2 if (L+1) is even?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be a positive number less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking two copies of `s` and merging them such that the end of the first `s` overlaps with the beginning of the second `s`. The overlapping part must be at least one character but less than the entire length of `s`.\n2. **Insight**: For a given string `t` of length `L`, the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `n`) must satisfy `n >= ceil((L + 1)/2)` and `n <= L - 1`. This ensures that the overlap `k = 2*n - L` is positive and less than `n`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible values of `n` from `(L + 2) // 2` to `L - 1`. For each `n`, compute `k = 2*n - L`. Check if the substring `t[0:n]` (the first `n` characters of `t`) followed by the substring `t[k:n]` (the part of `s` starting from `k` to the end) equals `t`. If it does, then `s = t[0:n]` is a valid solution.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible `n` in linear time relative to the length of `t`, making it efficient for the given constraints (string length up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    L = len(t)\n    \n    if L == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    n_min = (L + 2) // 2\n    n_max = L - 1\n    \n    found = False\n    s_candidate = None\n    \n    for n in range(n_min, n_max + 1):\n        k = 2 * n - L\n        if k < 1 or k >= n:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[n:] == t[k:n]:\n            s_candidate = t[:n]\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `L` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty, the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Range Calculation**: The minimum possible length of `s` (`n_min`) is calculated as `(L + 2) // 2`, ensuring it meets the overlap condition. The maximum length (`n_max`) is `L - 1`.\n4. **Iteration and Validation**: For each candidate length `n` from `n_min` to `n_max`, the overlap `k` is computed. If `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ `k` < `n`), the algorithm checks if the substring `t[n:]` matches `t[k:n]`. If they match, `s_candidate` is set to `t[:n]`, and the loop breaks.\n5. **Output**: If a valid `s_candidate` is found, \"YES\" and the candidate are printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical strings `s` with a valid overlap, leveraging simple string slicing and comparison.",
