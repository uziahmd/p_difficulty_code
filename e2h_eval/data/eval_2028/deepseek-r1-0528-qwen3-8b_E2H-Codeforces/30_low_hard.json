Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players, each making exactly n moves. In each move, the player takes the leftmost digit and appends it to their own number.\n We are to output a string of length 2n containing 'H' and 'M' (each exactly n times) that corresponds to the sequence of moves that maximizes the total prize.\n\n The total prize is S1 + S2, where S1 is the number formed by Homer (H's moves) and S2 by Marge (M's moves).\n\n Since the moves are fixed in order (each time we take the leftmost digit), we can think of the entire process as partitioning the string A into two subsequences (each of length n) but maintaining the original order? Actually, note: the moves are sequential and we always take the leftmost remaining digit. So the entire process is determined by the order in which we assign the digits to H or M.\n\n However, note: the assignment must be such that the first n moves (if we consider the entire sequence of 2n moves) are assigned to the two players, but the catch is that the digits are taken from the front of the remaining string.\n\n But note: the two players take turns? Actually, the problem says: \"Before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\" So we can choose the order arbitrarily as long as each makes n moves.\n\n Therefore, we are allowed to assign the 2n digits to two sequences (Homer and Marge) of length n, and the catch is that the digits are taken from the front. However, the order of the digits in the original string must be preserved in the resulting numbers? Actually no, because when we remove the leftmost digit, the next leftmost is the next one, so the digits are taken in the original order. But they are split arbitrarily between the two players.\n\n However, note: the entire process is fixed in the sense that the i-th digit (from left) is removed at some step, and then appended to either Homer or Marge's number. The catch is that the removal is always from the front, so the relative order of the digits in each player's number is the same as in A.\n\n But the problem: we want to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n How do we assign the digits? We have to assign each of the 2n digits to either Homer or Marge, and the assignment must be such that we take the digits from left to right (so the k-th digit in the original string will be the k-th digit in the combined sequence, but we are free to assign each occurrence to one of the two players, as long as each gets n digits).\n\n However, note: the entire sequence of removals is fixed: we start with the whole string and remove the first digit at each step. But the assignment is arbitrary (we can choose at each step which player takes the digit). But the catch: we cannot change the order of removal.\n\n Actually, the process is: \n   Initially, A = d0 d1 d2 ... d_{2n-1}\n   Then we decide for the first removal: assign d0 to either H or M.\n   Then we have a new string: either d1...d_{2n-1} (if d0 went to H) or d1...d_{2n-1} (if d0 went to M).\n   Then we assign d1 (the next leftmost) to one of the players, etc.\n\n So the assignment must be a sequence of choices (H or M) for each of the 2n digits.\n\n But note: the two numbers S1 and S2 are built by appending the digits in the order they are taken. Since the digits are taken in the original order, the i-th digit of S1 (if we consider the entire sequence) is the j-th digit of A (for some j) and similarly for S2.\n\n How to maximize S1 + S2?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let X be the sequence of digits for Homer (a string of n digits) and Y for Marge (a string of n digits). Then the total prize is int(X) + int(Y). However, note that the digits are taken from A in order, so the assignment is a way to pick two increasing-indexed subsequences (without changing the order) of length n from A, and the rest is not used (but actually all digits are used). However, the catch: the two subsequences together form a partition of the entire string (each digit is used exactly once) and the indices of the digits in X must be increasing and similarly for Y, and also the entire set of indices is {0,1,...,2n-1}. \n\n But note: the removal order is fixed, so the assignment must be such that the chosen digits for H and M are taken in increasing",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of two numbers, S1 and S2, formed by two players, Homer and Marge, by strategically assigning each digit of the given 2n-digit number A to either player. The digits must be assigned in such a way that each player ends up with exactly n digits, and the digits are taken from the leftmost end of A in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires partitioning the 2n-digit number A into two subsequences (each of length n) such that the sum of the numbers formed by these subsequences is maximized. The key observation here is that the leftmost digits have a higher positional value in the resulting numbers, so prioritizing larger digits for earlier positions can maximize the sum.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal strategy involves comparing digits from the start of the number and assigning the larger digit to the player who will benefit more from it. Specifically, we compare the current digit with the next digit:\n   - If the current digit is larger than the next one, assign it to the first player (Homer).\n   - Otherwise, assign it to the second player (Marge).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach where we iterate through the digits of A, making decisions based on the comparison between consecutive digits. This ensures that we always place the larger digit in a position where it contributes more significantly to the sum.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    \n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(A):\n        if i + 1 < len(A) and A[i] > A[i + 1]:\n            result.append('H')\n            i += 2\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            i += 2\n            \n    while len(result) < 2 * n:\n        result.append('M')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer n and the 2n-digit string A.\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: The algorithm iterates through the string A, comparing each digit with the next one. If the current digit is larger, it assigns 'H' (Homer's move) and skips the next digit; otherwise, it assigns 'M' (Marge's move). This ensures that larger digits are placed earlier in the numbers, maximizing their contribution to the sum.\n3. **Handling Remaining Moves**: If the loop ends before all moves are assigned (unlikely due to the even length of A), the remaining moves are filled with 'M' to ensure both players make exactly n moves.\n4. **Output**: The sequence of moves is printed as a string of 'H' and 'M' characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the sum by leveraging a greedy strategy that prioritizes higher digits for earlier positions, thus ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
