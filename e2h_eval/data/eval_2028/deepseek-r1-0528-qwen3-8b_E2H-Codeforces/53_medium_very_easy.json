    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a simple approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We want to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n 3. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, note that the problem asks for the longest such substring.\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to use a dictionary (or set) to record all substrings and their lengths, but we are interested in the maximum length.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate from the largest possible substring length down to 1, and check if there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps for this approach:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   For length L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (since a substring of length L must appear at least twice, so the total length must be at least 2*L, so L <= n//2, but actually two occurrences might not necessarily require 2*L because they can overlap? Actually, no: the two occurrences can start at different indices, but the same substring of length L must appear in two different starting positions. The maximum L we need to check is floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping occurrences then the total length required is 2*L, but note: they can overlap. Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice can be up to floor((n+1)/2) ??? \n\n But note: Consider \"aaa\": \n   substring \"aa\" appears at least twice (at index0 and index1). The string length is 3, so maximum L is 2? Actually, \"aa\" has length 2, and it appears twice. But wait: \"a\" also appears multiple times, but we are looking for the longest.\n\n However, the problem says: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". \n\n Example: \"ababa\" -> output 3. Why? The substring \"aba\" appears twice: at index0 and index2.\n\n So we need to consider overlapping occurrences.\n\n Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice must be less than the entire string. The condition is that we need two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n How many distinct starting positions do we need? The two occurrences can be consecutive and overlapping. \n\n We can do:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   Let max_len = 0\n\n   We'll check for lengths from min(n, ...) down to 1. Actually, the maximum length that can appear twice is at most n-1 (if n>=2) because we need two characters at least. But note: the two occurrences must be non-empty and the same.\n\n   However, we can set the maximum possible length as floor(n/1) but we know two occurrences: the first occurrence starts at i and the second at j, and they must not necessarily cover the entire string. Actually, the maximum length L must satisfy: there exist two indices i and j such that j+L <= n and i < j and the substring from i to i+L-1 equals the substring from j to j+L-1.\n\n   But note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, even with one completely inside the other? Actually, we are just taking contiguous parts.\n\n   Since the string length is small (<=100), we can do:\n\n   For L in range(min(n, ?), 0, -1): Actually, we don't know the upper bound for L. The maximum L for which two occurrences can exist is when the two occurrences are as long as possible. The condition for two occurrences is that the substring of length L appears at two different starting indices. The maximum L we can have is the length of the string minus the gap between the two occurrences. But the gap must be at least 0 (overlap). The maximum L is such that there exists two starting indices i and j (i < j) with j-i >= 0 and j+L <= n. The maximum j can be is n-L, so we require i from 0 to n-L-1 and j from i+1 to n-L. But note: we don't require non-overlapping, so the two occurrences can share some letters.\n\n   Actually, the maximum L for which two occurrences exist is the maximum integer L such that there exists two indices i and j (i<j) with j-i < L and j+L <= n? Actually, no: the condition is only that the substring of length L starting at i and the substring of length L starting at j are equal, and j can be as low as i+1 (so the two substrings overlap by L-1 characters).\n\n   We can simply iterate over all possible L from 1 to n//2 (but wait, what about odd lengths? Actually, we can have L up to n-1, but we need two occurrences, so the maximum L is n-1 only if the entire string is repeated, but that requires two copies of the entire string, which is impossible unless n==0. Actually, the maximum L is such that there are two starting indices i and j (with i<j) and j+L <= n. The maximum j is n-L, so the condition is that we have two starting indices i and j (with j>=i+1) and j<=n-L.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate L from 1 to n, and check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Then take the maximum L for which this is true.\n\n   However, the problem says: the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can break early if we find a duplicate for a given L and then output L? But note: we are iterating from larger L to smaller, so the first duplicate we find is the maximum.\n\n   But note: we must output the length. And if no duplicate substring is found, output 0.\n\n   Steps:\n     n = len(s)\n     max_duplicate_length = 0\n\n     For L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        Create a set of all substrings of length L.\n        If the size of the set is less than the number of substrings (which is n - L + 1), then we found at least one duplicate.\n\n        However, we don't need the entire set to have duplicates, we just need to know if there's at least one substring that appears twice.\n\n        We can break when we find one duplicate.\n\n     But wait, the problem says \"at least twice\", but we are only checking for duplicates (two occurrences). However, if we find one substring that appears more than twice, that's okay, but we are only concerned with the existence of two.\n\n     However, the problem asks for the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. So if we find a duplicate for length L, then we output L and break.\n\n     But note: it is possible that a longer substring (larger L) appears twice, so we should start from the maximum possible L and go downwards until we find one.\n\n     Maximum L: the maximum L for which two occurrences can exist is n-1? Actually, consider: if we have two occurrences, the starting index i and j must satisfy j+L <= n. The maximum L we can have is n - j_min, where j_min is the smallest index after i. But the smallest j_min is 1 (if we have two consecutive starting indices). So the maximum L is n-1? Actually, if we have a substring of length L, then the last starting index is n-L. To have two occurrences, we need at least two starting indices. The maximum L is the length of the substring that appears twice, and the smallest starting index is 0, then the next starting index must be at least 1, so the substring must end at index 1+L-1 = L, so we require L <= n-1 (because the substring from 0 to L-1 and from 1 to L must be within the string). But note: the substring from 0 to L-1 and from 1 to L: the second substring goes from index1 to index L, so we require L < n (because the substring of length L starting at 1 must end at index L, and we require L < n). Therefore, the maximum L we need to check is n-1.\n\n     However, we can set L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n     But wait: what if the string is \"abcabc\"? Then the substring \"abc\" (length 3) appears twice, and the string length is 6. Then 3 is less than 6-1=5, so we would check L=5,4,3... and then at L=3 we find duplicate and return 3.\n\n     However, we must consider: the two occurrences for a substring of length L must be two distinct starting indices (so we require at least two starting indices). The number of starting indices for a substring of length L is n-L+1. We need to check if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\n     Algorithm for fixed L:\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                then we found a duplicate for length L -> so answer is L and break the outer loop.\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        If we finish the inner loop without finding a duplicate, then we try the next smaller L.\n\n     But note: we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) down to 1. So the first duplicate we find is the longest.\n\n     Edge case: if no duplicate is found, then output 0.\n\n     However, what if the string has duplicate of a substring of length 0? But the problem says non-empty string, and substring must be contiguous and at least one character? Actually, the problem says \"substring\", and the minimal substring is one character. But the problem states: \"at least twice\", so if there are two same characters, then we have a substring of length 1.\n\n     Example: \"zzz\" -> output 2. Wait, let me check: the example input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives output ['0','3','2'].\n\n        \"abcd\": no duplicate substring -> output 0.\n        \"ababa\": the substring \"aba\" (length 3) appears twice (at index0 and index2). Also \"bab\" (length 3) appears once? Actually, \"aba\" and \"aba\" (the one at index2 is \"aba\" again). So yes, length 3 is the answer.\n        \"zzz\": the substring \"zz\" (length 2) appears twice: at index0 and index1. Also \"z\" (length 1) appears three times. But the longest is 2.\n\n     So our algorithm for \"zzz\":\n        Check L=2: \n          substrings: \n            index0: \"zz\"\n            index1: \"z\" -> wait, no! For L=2, the substring at index1 is s[1:3] = \"zz\", so we have two substrings: \"zz\" at index0 and \"zz\" at index1. So we find a duplicate and return 2.\n\n     This matches.\n\n     But wait: what about L=3 for \"zzz\"? \n        substring at index0: \"zzz\"\n        substring at index1: out of bounds (since 1+3=4 > 3) -> so only one substring of length 3. So no duplicate for L=3.\n\n     So we are correct.\n\n     However, note: the above method for fixed L iterates over all starting indices and uses a set. The total work is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if we check many L's). But since the string length is at most 100, and the maximum L is 99, and for each L we do O(n) iterations and each substring operation is O(L) which is at most 99, so worst-case total operations is about 100 * 100 * 99 = 990000, which is acceptable.\n\n     Alternatively, we could use a different approach: storing all substrings in a dictionary and then checking the maximum length of substring that has frequency>=2. But then we would have to consider all lengths, and we want the maximum length. We can do:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        # We'll create a dictionary mapping substring -> list of starting indices (or just count) but we are interested in the length of the substring.\n\n        But then we have to store all substrings and their lengths. And then we look for the maximum length among those that have frequency>=2.\n\n        However, the problem says the string length is at most 100, so the total number of substrings is about 5050 (n*(n+1)//2). This is acceptable.\n\n        Steps for alternative:\n          Let d = {}  # key: substring, value: set of starting indices (or just frequency, but we don't need the exact frequency, just >=2)\n          But we are going to generate all substrings and record their length.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          max_len = 0\n          for length in range(1, n+1):\n              substring_dict = {}\n              for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                  substr = s[start:start+length]\n                  if substr in substring_dict:\n                      substring_dict[substr].append(start)\n                  else:\n                      substring_dict[substr] = [start]\n\n              # Now, check if any substring in substring_dict has at least two occurrences (the list has length>=2)\n              for substr, starts in substring_dict.items():\n                  if len(starts) >= 2:\n                      # Then we have a substring of length `length` that appears at least twice.\n                      # We are iterating from length=1 to n, so we can update max_len and continue to see if a longer one exists?\n                      # But we want the longest. So we can break the inner loop and remember the current length, then break the outer loop? No, because we are increasing length.\n\n              But wait: we are iterating from small to large. We want the longest, so we should break when we find a duplicate for a given length and then continue to see if a longer one exists? Actually, we are iterating from 1 to n, so the last duplicate we find is the longest. But we can break the outer loop as soon as we find one duplicate for a given length and then continue to the next length? Actually, no: we are iterating from 1 to n, so if we find a duplicate at length L, then we know that there is a substring of length L that appears twice, but there might be a longer substring (say L+1) that also appears twice. So we cannot break the outer loop.\n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate from n down to 1 and break at the first duplicate we find (which will be the maximum length). That is more efficient.\n\n     Let's stick to the first method: iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n     Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # We are going to check L from n-1 down to 1.\n        # But note: the maximum L for which two occurrences can exist is n-1 (as discussed). However, we can also consider that the two occurrences must be distinct and the substring of length L must appear at least twice. The minimum requirement for two occurrences is that there are at least two starting indices. The number of starting indices is n - L + 1. So we require n - L + 1 >= 2 -> L <= n-1.\n\n        # So we set L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        # However, what if the string is of length 1? Then n=1, so we check L from 0 down to 1? Actually, we start from n-1=0, then we break the loop because we are iterating from 0 down to 1 (if we use range(n-1,0,-1)) then we don't check L=0. But the problem says non-empty string, and the substring must appear at least twice. For a string of length 1, the only substring is the entire string, and it appears only once. So the answer is 0.\n\n        # Our loop for n=1: \n        #   range(0,0,-1) -> empty. Then we output 0.\n\n        # But we can also consider: the two occurrences must be distinct. For a substring of length L, the two starting indices must be different. For n=1, we cannot have two starting indices for any L>=1 because the number of starting indices is 1 (for L=1: one substring; for L>1: no substring). \n\n        # So the code:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # We found a duplicate\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)   # or break out and then we output L, but we can break and then after the loop output 0 if not found.\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n\n        # If we get here, no duplicate was found for any L from 1 to n-1, so output 0.\n        print(0)\n\n     However, wait: what if there is a duplicate substring of length L, but we break and output L, then we are done.\n\n     But note: we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) down to 1, so the first duplicate we find is the longest.\n\n     But what if there are two different duplicates? We break at the first one we find (which is the longest). This is correct.\n\n     But wait: the example \"ababa\": \n        n = 5, so we check L from 4 down to 1.\n\n        L=4: substrings: \n            s[0:4] = \"abab\"\n            s[1:5] = \"baba\"\n            These are different -> no duplicate.\n\n        L=3: \n            s[0:3] = \"aba\"\n            s[1:4] = \"bab\"\n            s[2:5] = \"aba\"\n            When we process the third substring \"aba\", we check: have we seen \"aba\" before? Yes, because we saw it at index0. So we output 3.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     But wait: what if the duplicate substring is of length 3, but we don't check L=3 until we finish L=4? Yes, because we are going from high to low.\n\n     However, the above code uses exit(0) which terminates the program. Alternatively, we can structure it without exit.\n\n     Revised without exit:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 1\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n     But wait: what if we break the inner loop and set ans=L, then break the outer loop. Then we output L.\n\n     However, what if we don't break the outer loop? Actually, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop with the condition.\n\n     But note: we break the outer loop after setting ans, so we output the first (largest) L that has a duplicate.\n\n     But what if we have two different duplicates for two different L's? We break at the first one (largest L) and output it.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     However, consider the possibility of having two different substrings of the same maximum length? Actually, we break at the first occurrence of a duplicate for that L, and we are iterating from the largest L downward. So we are sure that the first duplicate we find is the maximum.\n\n     But note: we break the inner loop as soon as we find one duplicate. That's sufficient because we only care about the existence of one duplicate for a given L.\n\n     Let me test with \"aaaa\": \n        n=4, check L=3:\n            substrings: \n                i=0: \"aaa\"\n                i=1: \"aaa\"\n                when i=1: \"aaa\" is already in seen? Yes, because we added \"aaa\" at i=0. So we break and output 3.\n\n     But wait: the substring \"aaa\" appears twice? Actually, the two occurrences are at index0 and index1. The substring \"aaa\" at index0 is \"aaa\", and at index1 is \"aaa\" (the substring starting at index1 is the last three characters). So yes.\n\n     However, what if we have \"aaba\": \n        n=4, check L=3:\n            i=0: \"aab\"\n            i=1: \"aba\"\n            no duplicate for L=3.\n        Then check L=2:\n            i=0: \"aa\"\n            i=1: \"ab\"\n            i=2: \"ba\"\n            no duplicate for L=2.\n        Then check L=1:\n            i=0: \"a\" -> add\n            i=1: \"a\" -> duplicate found. Output 1.\n\n     But wait, the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). So the answer is 1.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     However, consider \"aabb\": \n        n=4, check L=3:\n            i0: \"aab\"\n            i1: \"abb\"\n            no duplicate.\n        L=2:\n            i0: \"aa\"\n            i1: \"ab\"\n            i2: \"bb\"\n            no duplicate for \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\". \n            But wait, \"aa\" appears once, \"ab\" appears once, \"bb\" appears once.\n        L=1:\n            i0: \"a\" -> add\n            i1: \"a\" -> duplicate -> output 1.\n\n     But wait: in \"aabb\", the substring \"a\" appears at index0 and index1, and \"b\" appears at index2 and index3. So the longest common substring that appears twice is of length 1.\n\n     However, what if we have \"abab\": \n        n=4, check L=3:\n            i0: \"aba\"\n            i1: \"bab\"\n            no duplicate.\n        L=2:\n            i0: \"ab\"\n            i1: \"ba\"\n            i2: \"ab\"\n            at i2: \"ab\" is already in seen (from i0). So output 2.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     But wait: the sample input includes \"zzz\", which we tested and it works.\n\n     However, the example input is given as a list: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but note: the problem says the first input line contains the string. So we read one string.\n\n     But the example input format: \n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        This is just an example showing three test cases.\n\n     We must read one string per run.\n\n     Since the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string\", we read one line.\n\n     Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n     However, note: the input is provided as a string. The example input is shown as a list, but actually the input is one string per test.\n\n     But wait: the problem says \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n     So we read one line.\n\n     But the example input has three strings? Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n     This is confusing. But note: the problem statement is describing the examples. In competitive programming, typically we read one test case per run.\n\n     Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one string per run.\n\n     However, the example input is given as a list, meaning that the sample tests are these three. But the problem says \"Output: ['0','3','2']\", meaning that for each input string we output the answer.\n\n     But wait, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input and output. Then the example input is given as a list.\n\n     Actually, the problem likely expects one string as input. The example input is just showing three examples.\n\n     Therefore, we read one string.\n\n     But note: the problem says \"It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\"\n\n     So we can assume one string.\n\n     However, the example input format in the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me clarify: the input is a single string.\n\n     But the example input is written as a list of strings. This might be just for illustration of multiple test cases. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n     Since the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", we read one line.\n\n     But wait: the sample test 2 is \"ababa\" and output 3, and sample test 3 is \"zzz\" and output 2.\n\n     However, the problem says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n     Therefore, we assume one string.\n\n     But note: the problem says \"Write a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout)\".\n\n     So we read one line.\n\n     However, the example input is given as a list. But in reality, the input is provided as:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n     or perhaps as a file with three lines? Or as one line with three strings? \n\n     The problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n     So we read one line. But the example input is shown as a list of three strings.\n\n     This discrepancy: the problem statement example input is given as a list, but the actual input is one string per line? Or one string per run?\n\n     Clarification: the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning that the entire input is one line.\n\n     But then how do we test with multiple examples? \n\n     Actually, the problem is for one test case. The example is just showing three examples.\n\n     So we assume one string per run.\n\n     But wait, the example output is given as ['0','3','2'] for the inputs ['abcd','ababa','zzz'].\n\n     This implies that the input may contain multiple test cases? \n\n     However, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The first input line\".\n\n     After re‐reading: \"The first input line contains the string.\" — meaning one string.\n\n     So we read one string.\n\n     But the example input is given as a list. This is just an example representation.\n\n     Therefore, we write the code to read one string.\n\n     However, if the competition provides multiple test cases, then we must adjust. But the problem does not specify.\n\n     Since the problem says the string is non-empty and length <=100, and we are reading from stdin, we can read one line.\n\n     But the problem says \"first input line\", so if there are multiple lines, we only read the first.\n\n     Example: \n        Input: \n            abcd\n\n        Output: 0\n\n        Input:\n            ababa\n\n        Output: 3\n\n        Input:\n            zzz\n\n        Output: 2\n\n     So we write the code accordingly.\n\n     One more edge: empty string. But the problem says non-empty.\n\n     Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so we skip.\n\n        # We are going to check for L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        # Special case: if n==0, but guaranteed non-empty.\n\n        ans = 0\n        # If the string length is 1, then n-1=0, so the loop runs from 0 down to 1 (step -1) -> no iteration, then we output 0.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found_duplicate = False\n            # Iterate over all starting indices for substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found_duplicate = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found_duplicate:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n     But wait: what if the string is \"aabb\", we break at L=1 and output 1. Correct.\n\n     But wait: what if the string is \"abcde\", then no duplicate for any L from 4 down to 1 -> output 0.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     However, there is a possibility: the two occurrences might be non-overlapping? Actually, our method accounts for overlapping because we are considering every starting index. The set method doesn't care about overlap.\n\n     But note: the problem allows overlapping.\n\n     This solution is O(n^3) in the worst-case because for each L (from n-1 down to 1) we do (n-L+1) iterations, and each substring extraction is O(L). The total is about sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L. For n=100, that's about 100*100*100 = 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n     However, we can optimize by breaking early in the inner loop and we are only checking from the maximum L downward, so we stop at the first duplicate.\n\n     But worst-case (no duplicate) we do all L from n-1 down to 1. The inner loop for L=99: 100-99+1=2 substrings, then L=98: 3 substrings, ... until L=1: 100 substrings.\n\n     The total operations is about (2+3+...+100) * (average substring length). The average substring length for L from 1 to 99 is about (1+99)/2 = 50, and the number of substrings for each L is (n-L+1). The total number of substrings is about n*(n+1)/2 ~ 5050, and each substring operation is O(L). The worst-case total operations is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n     We can compute: \n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L = (n+1)*sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L - sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L^2\n        = (n+1)*( (n-1)*n/2 ) - ( (n-1)*n*(2*n-1) )/6\n\n     For n=100: \n        = 101 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199)/6\n        = 101 * 4950 - (99*100*199)/6\n        = 499950 - 328350\n        = 171600\n\n     Then multiplied by the average length? Actually, no: in our inner loop, for a fixed L, we do (n-L+1) iterations, and each iteration we extract a substring of length L. The cost of extracting a substring is O(L) because we copy the substring? Or in Python, slicing creates a new string. The total cost for a fixed L is O((n-L+1)*L). \n\n     But wait, we are doing set operations. The set operations (adding and checking) are O(L) per operation? Actually, the set uses hashing and the hash of a string of length L is O(L). So each insertion and lookup is O(L). Therefore, the total cost for a fixed L is O((n-L+1)*L) and the total over all L is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L^2.\n\n     That is worse: O(n^4) in the worst-case? Because the inner loop is O(L) per substring, and we do (n-L+1) substrings.\n\n     Alternatively, we can avoid the slicing by using rolling hash or string interning? But the string length is at most 100, and the total number of substrings is about 5050, and the total length of all substrings is about 5050 * average_length. The average length is about 50, so total characters processed is 5050 * 50 = 252500, which is acceptable.\n\n     But wait, in our current method, for each substring we do a slice which creates a new string of length L. The total memory and time might be high.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a rolling hash to represent the substring. Then we store the hash values (which are integers) and avoid the actual substring slicing.\n\n     Steps for rolling hash (to avoid the cost of slicing):\n\n        We choose a base and modulus. Since the string is small, we can use double hashing to avoid collisions, but the problem is small so even one modulus might be acceptable, but the alphabet is 26, so we can use base=131 and modulus a large prime.\n\n        However, the problem constraints are small, so we can also use tuple of (start_index, end_index) to represent the substring, but that doesn't help the set operations.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary that maps the substring (by its hash) to the set of starting indices. But we want to check for duplicates.\n\n        But note: we are only checking for the existence of a duplicate for a fixed L.\n\n        We can precompute the hash for each substring of length L. We can use a rolling hash to compute the hash for the substring s[i:i+L] in O(1) time after O(n) precomputation.\n\n        Steps for rolling hash for fixed L:\n\n            Precompute the prefix hash array for the string s, and then the hash for s[i:i+L] = (prefix[i+L] - prefix[i]*base^L) % mod.\n\n        But then we have to do this for every L? That would be too heavy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We are iterating L from n-1 down to 1. For each L, we want to check for duplicate substrings of length L.\n\n            We can use a set that stores the hash value of the substring (using a base and modulus). We use two mods to reduce collisions.\n\n        However, given the small constraints (n<=100), we can also use the fact that the total number of distinct substrings is not huge.\n\n        Another idea: we can use a dictionary that maps the substring itself (the string) to the set of starting indices. But then we are storing the substring, which is O(L) per substring.\n\n        But the total storage is the same as the original method.\n\n        Given that n is at most 100, the worst-case total length of all substrings is about 5050 * (average length) which is 5050 * 50 = 252500, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But the slicing operation: each slice s[i:i+L] creates a new string of length L. The total memory is about 252500 characters, which is 252500 bytes, which is 250 KB, acceptable.\n\n        And the time is acceptable.\n\n        So we leave the code as is.\n\n     However, we can try to optimize by using a single pass for all L? Probably not necessary.\n\n     Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If n==0: but guaranteed non-empty.\n        ans = 0\n        # We are going to check L from n-1 down to 1.\n        # But note: the maximum L is n-1, and minimum is 1.\n\n        # If the string length is 1, then n-1=0, so the loop doesn't run.\n\n        # Edge: if the string has duplicate characters, but we are checking from the top.\n\n        # Let's run the loop.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            # Generate all substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                # Extract substring from i to i+L\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n     But wait: what if the string is very long? The problem says at most 100, so we are safe.\n\n     However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n     Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0. Correct.\n     Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3. Correct.\n     Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2. Correct.\n\n     Another test: \"a\" -> output 0. Correct.\n\n     But wait: what about \"aa\"? \n        n=2, check L=1 (from 1 down to 1):\n            i=0: \"a\" -> add\n            i=1: \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The substrings can overlap, which means we need to check all possible substrings of varying lengths to find duplicates.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length as the result since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards, ensuring the first found is the longest.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all starting positions in the string. If any substring of the current length is found more than once, the length is recorded as the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (length and starting positions) and substring operations. However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                ans = L\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            seen.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            break\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), the output is 0.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all possible starting positions in the string.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set, it means there's a duplicate, and the current length is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks as soon as the first duplicate is found for the largest possible length, ensuring efficiency.\n6. **Output Result**: The length of the longest duplicate substring is printed. If no duplicates are found, the output remains 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging set operations to detect duplicates early, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
