    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n However, note: we need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and these occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can consider all substrings and check for duplicates. But note: the problem asks for the longest one.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - We want the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check from the maximum possible length (which is n-1) down to 1 until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n How to check for a fixed length L?\n   - Extract all distinct substrings of length L (using a set or dictionary to track seen ones)\n   - If we find at least one substring that appears more than once (or if we find two different starting indices for the same substring), then L is achievable.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two or more.\n\n However, we are asked for the maximum L. So we can start from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) and go downwards until we find one.\n\n But wait: what is the maximum L? The maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is at most floor(n/2)*2? Actually, no: they can overlap, so even a substring of length 50 might appear twice in a string of length 100 (if the string is composed of repeating patterns). However, the maximum L cannot exceed n//2 + something? Actually, consider: the two occurrences must be non-overlapping? No, they can overlap. But the condition is that the substring of length L must appear at least twice. The entire string of length 100 can have a substring of length 100, but that appears only once. The next candidate is length 99: but then we have two substrings of length 99 (from index0 to index98 and index1 to index99) and if they are the same, then that's two. But if not, we look for a shorter one.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be contiguous. They can be anywhere. But the maximum L we can have is at most n-1 (because if we take the whole string, there's only one occurrence). Actually, the maximum L for which two occurrences exist must be less than n.\n\n Actually, let me think: \n   - The two occurrences can start at different positions. The first occurrence ends at index i+L-1, the second at index j+L-1. The condition for overlapping is that the second occurrence starts at j (with j < i) and the substring from j to j+L-1 is the same as from i to i+L-1.\n\n But note: the maximum length we can have is when the two occurrences are as long as possible. However, if we have a string of length n, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice is at most n-1 (because if we take a substring of length n, it appears only once). But actually, if we take a substring of length n-1, then there are two consecutive substrings (starting at index0 and index1) that are of length n-1. So if the string has two consecutive substrings of length n-1 that are the same, then that length is valid.\n\n However, we are to find the maximum L. So we can iterate L from min(n-1, some upper bound) down to 1, but note: the two occurrences don't have to be consecutive. But the maximum L is bounded by n-1 because if L==n, then there is only one occurrence.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaaaa\", then the substring \"aaaa\" (length 4) appears multiple times. In fact, the maximum L would be 4, because the entire string is 5, and the substring of length 5 appears only once. However, note that the substring \"aaa\" (length 3) appears multiple times, but 4 is larger and also appears multiple times.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n  Let n = len(s)\n  For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):   # from n-1 down to 1\n      Create a set (or use a dictionary) to record the substrings of length L and their frequency?\n      Alternatively, we can use a set and break when we see a duplicate.\n\n      Steps for fixed L:\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  Then we found a duplicate, so answer is L and break out.\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n\n      If we found a duplicate, output L and exit.\n  If we don't find any, output 0.\n\n However, note: we are iterating from the maximum L (n-1) downward, so the first duplicate we find is the maximum L.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"abcd\" -> n=4, we check L=3: \n        substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate -> then L=2: \n        \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\": no duplicate -> then L=1: \n        \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\": no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n   Input: \"ababa\" -> n=5, check L=4: \n        substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: \n            \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we see \"aba\" twice -> output 3.\n\n   Input: \"zzz\" -> n=3, check L=2: \n        substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n This matches the sample outputs.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty and up to 100 characters. Since 100 is small, we can do this.\n\n But worst-case: we check from L=99 down to 1. For each L, we iterate over (n-L+1) substrings, and each substring has length L. The total operations would be about sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L. \n\n Since n<=100, the worst-case total operations is about 100*100 = 10000, which is acceptable.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, we can optimize by breaking early. Also, we can avoid creating a set for each L from high to low. But since n is small, it's acceptable.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # If the string is empty, but guaranteed non-empty, so skip.\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n But wait: what if the same substring appears more than two times? We break at the first duplicate. That's okay because we are looking for at least two.\n\n However, note: we are checking from the largest L first, so we get the maximum L.\n\n Let me test with \"aaa\": \n   n=3, L from 2 down to 1.\n   L=2: substrings: \"aa\", \"aa\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n Another example: \"aabbaabb\" (length 8). \n   We hope to find a long substring that repeats. \n   The entire string is 8, so L=7: \n        \"aabbaab\", \"abbaabb\" -> not same.\n   L=6: \n        \"aabbaab\", \"bbaabb\" -> wait, actually the substrings for L=6 are:\n            \"aabbaab\", \"abbaabb\", \"bbaabba\"? Wait, the string is \"aabbaabb\", so:\n            index0: \"aabbaab\"\n            index1: \"abbaabb\"\n            index2: \"bbaabb\" -> wait, no: the substring of length 6 from index2: \"baabba\" (if the string is \"aabbaabb\", then index2 to index7: 'aabbaabb'[2:8] -> 'aabbaa'? Let me write it:\n\n            Actually, the string is \"aabbaabb\". \n            L=6: \n                i=0: \"aabbaa\" -> wait, no: \n                Actually, the string is \"aabbaabb\": \n                    i0: \"aabbaa\" -> wait, that's 6 letters: from index0 to index5: 'aabbaa'? \n                    Correction: \n                        s[0:6] = \"aabbaa\" -> but wait, the string is \"aabbaabb\": \n                        indices: 0:a,1:a,2:b,3:b,4:a,5:a,6:b,7:b.\n                        So substring at 0:6 -> \"aabbaa\" (from index0 to index5 inclusive? In Python, s[0:6] gives characters at indices 0,1,2,3,4,5 -> 'a','a','b','b','a','a' -> \"aabbaa\"\n                        substring at 1:7 -> \"abbaab\" (indices1 to6: 'a','b','b','a','a','b') -> \"abbaab\"\n                        substring at 2:8 -> but 8 is beyond the string, so from 2 to7: \"bbbaab\"? Wait, no: from index2 to index7 is 6 characters: \n                        index2: 'b', index3:'b', index4:'a', index5:'a', index6:'b', index7:'b' -> \"bbaabb\"\n\n            So the three substrings for L=6 are: \"aabbaa\", \"abbaab\", \"bbaabb\". None repeated.\n\n            Then L=5: \n                i0: \"aabba\"\n                i1: \"abbaa\"\n                i2: \"bbaab\"\n                i3: \"baabb\"\n                i4: \"aabb\" -> wait, no: from i4: s[4:9] -> but 9 is beyond, so substring of length5 from i4: s[4:9] -> but the string is only 8, so from index4: \"aabb\" (only 4 characters) -> wait, no: from index4: we take 5 characters: s[4:9] -> but 9 is beyond, so we get s[4:9] which is \"aabb\" (but that's only 4 characters). \n\n            Actually, the loop for i in range(0, n-L+1) for L=5: n=8, so i from 0 to 3 (inclusive). So we have 4 substrings.\n\n            So we have to be careful: the last substring is from index 3 to 3+5 = 8, which is the last 5 characters: \"baabb\" (from index3 to index7: 'b','a','a','b','b') -> \"baabb\".\n\n            Now, check duplicates: \n                \"aabba\", \"abbaa\", \"bbaab\", \"baabb\" -> no duplicates.\n\n            Then L=4: \n                i0: \"aabb\"\n                i1: \"abba\"\n                i2: \"bbaa\"\n                i3: \"aabb\" -> duplicate: \"aabb\" appears at i0 and i3.\n\n            So output 4.\n\n            But wait, the string \"aabbaabb\" has the substring \"aabb\" appearing at the beginning and then again at the end (overlapping? actually, the two occurrences are at [0:4] and [4:8]). They are not overlapping? But the problem says they can overlap. However, in this case, they are separated by two 'a's. But that's okay.\n\n            However, note that the two occurrences of \"aabb\" are not overlapping. But the problem allows overlapping. \n\n            But our method for L=4: \n                We are generating:\n                    i0: \"aabb\"\n                    i1: \"abba\"\n                    i2: \"bbaa\"\n                    i3: \"aabb\"\n\n            So we have duplicate at i0 and i3. That's two non-overlapping occurrences. But also, there is an overlapping occurrence? Actually, the substring \"aabb\" appears at index0 and index4 (which is the same as i3 in 0-indexing for substring extraction: because our substring extraction for i=3 gives s[3:7] -> but wait, our string is 8 characters, so index3 to index6 is \"aabb\"? \n\n            Let me write the string: \n                index0: a\n                index1: a\n                index2: b\n                index3: b\n                index4: a\n                index5: a\n                index6: b\n                index7: b\n\n            Then substring at i=0: s[0:4] -> \"aabb\"\n            substring at i=3: s[3:7] -> \"bbaa\"? Wait, no: from index3 to index6 (since 3+4=7, so [3:7]) -> \"b\" (index3), 'b' (index4)? Wait, no: \n            Actually, the substring of length4 starting at index3: \n                index3: 'b'\n                index4: 'a'\n                index5: 'a'\n                index6: 'b' -> so \"baab\", not \"aabb\".\n\n            I think I messed up the example. Let me correct:\n\n            The string is \"aabbaabb\"\n            Breakdown:\n                s[0] = 'a'\n                s[1] = 'a'\n                s[2] = 'b'\n                s[3] = 'b'\n                s[4] = 'a'\n                s[5] = 'a'\n                s[6] = 'b'\n                s[7] = 'b'\n\n            For L=4:\n                i=0: s[0:4] = \"aabb\"\n                i=1: s[1:5] = \"abba\"\n                i=2: s[2:6] = \"bbaa\"\n                i=3: s[3:7] = \"baab\"\n                i=4: s[4:8] = \"aabb\"   -> wait, i=4: from index4 to index7: \"aabb\"\n\n            So the two occurrences of \"aabb\" are at i=0 and i=4.\n\n            Now, the substring \"aabb\" at i=0 and i=4: \n                They are separated by two characters (so they don't overlap). \n\n            But note: the problem says occurrences can overlap. So even if they don't overlap, that's acceptable.\n\n            However, in our code, we are checking for any duplicate. So we will find \"aabb\" at i=0 and then at i=4.\n\n            But wait, in the loop for L=4, we are going from i=0 to i=4 (since n-L+1 = 8-4+1 = 5, so i from 0 to 4). \n\n            So the set will have:\n                i0: add \"aabb\"\n                i1: add \"abba\"\n                i2: add \"bbaa\"\n                i3: add \"baab\"\n                i4: \"aabb\" is already in the set -> duplicate found.\n\n            So we output 4.\n\n            But wait, is there a longer substring that repeats? We started from L=7,6,5 and didn't find, so 4 is the maximum.\n\n            However, note: the entire string is \"aabbaabb\", and we can see that the substring \"aabb\" (length4) appears twice, but also the substring \"aa\" (length2) appears multiple times, but 4 is longer.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n One more edge: empty string? The problem says non-empty.\n\n Let me test with \"a\": \n        n=1, then L from 0 to 0 (since n-1=0, and we go from 0 down to 0) -> then the loop runs for L=0? But our loop condition: range(n-1,0,-1) -> if n=1, then n-1=0, so range(0,0,-1) is empty. Then we print 0. Correct.\n\n But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty, and the longest substring that appears at least twice: for \"a\", there is no substring of length>=1 that appears twice, so 0 is correct.\n\n Code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the range function in Python: \n   range(start, stop, step) goes from start down to stop+1 (if step is negative) but stops before reaching stop.\n\n   So for n=1: range(0,0,-1) -> empty.\n\n   We can adjust the loop to go from n-1 down to 1 (so we skip 0). But if n=1, then we don't enter the loop and print 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the loop from n-1 down to 1 (inclusive). \n\n   We can do: for L in range(n-1, 0, -1): \n\n   This is correct.\n\n But note: what if n=0? The problem says non-empty, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Final code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n   # If the string is of length 1, then we output 0.\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n Let me test with provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0 -> correct.\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3 -> correct.\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2 -> correct.\n\n   Example 4: \"aaa\" -> output 2 -> correct.\n\n   Example 5: \"a\" -> output 0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 6: \"aabbaabb\" -> output 4 -> correct.\n\n   Example 7: \"abcde\" -> output 0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 8: \"aaaa\" -> \n        n=4, check L=3: \n            i0: \"aaa\", i1: \"aaa\" -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   Example 9: \"aba\" -> \n        n=3, check L=2: \n            i0: \"ab\", i1: \"ba\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=1: \n                i0: \"a\", i1: \"b\", i2: \"a\" -> duplicate \"a\" -> output 1.\n\n   But wait, in \"aba\", the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index2). So the answer should be 1. Our code does that.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"longest substring\", so we are checking from the largest L first. But in \"aba\", the maximum L for which there is a duplicate is 1 (because L=2 doesn't have duplicate, and L=3 is not checked because n=3, so L goes from 2 down to 1). And indeed, the substring \"a\" (length1) is the longest that appears twice.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n Let me run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n But note: the sample input format is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but actually, the input is read from stdin. We are reading one string per line.\n\n   Input: \n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   But wait, the sample input is given as a list of strings. However, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we read one string.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   Then process.\n\n   However, the sample output is given as ['0','3','2'] meaning three separate runs.\n\n   But the problem says: \n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is ambiguous. But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one string per run.\n\n   Since the problem is competitive programming, we assume one string per test case.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list. Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains the string.\n\n   So we are to read one string.\n\n   However, the example output is a list of answers for three different strings.\n\n   But the problem is: we are to write a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n   So if we are given one string, we output one number.\n\n   But the example input is given as three strings. This might be because the problem statement example is showing multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem says: \"You're given a string\", so we assume one string per execution.\n\n   So we write:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        ... \n\n   and output the answer.\n\n   However, if the problem intended multiple test cases, then we would need to read until EOF. But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", implying one string.\n\n   Since the constraints say the string length <=100, and the string is non-empty, we read one string.\n\n   But wait, the sample input is provided as a list of three strings. How do we know if the judge provides one string or multiple?\n\n   Looking at the problem statement: \n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is just an example of the input format. Actually, the input is one string per test case, and the example shows three test cases.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one line of input. So we assume one string per run.\n\n   But if the judge runs multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF. \n\n   Let me reread the problem: \n        \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So one string per test case, and the problem does not specify multiple test cases. \n\n   But note: the problem is presented as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n   And the example input is given as a list, which might be confusing.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"You're given a string\", meaning one string.\n\n   So we assume one string per run.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   However, the example input format in the problem statement is ambiguous. But the sample outputs are for three separate inputs.\n\n   Since the problem is from competitive programming, sometimes they provide multiple test cases. \n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" \n\n   So if we are to handle multiple test cases, we would read until EOF. \n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty and the length doesn't exceed 100. It doesn't say there are multiple.\n\n   However, the example output is provided as a list of three numbers.\n\n   How should we interpret this? \n\n   There are two possibilities:\n     1. The problem expects one string per run, and the example input was provided as a list for illustration of multiple examples.\n     2. The problem expects multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The first input line\", it implies one string per input.\n\n   But wait, the sample input is given as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is likely just a representation of three separate test cases. In a typical competitive programming contest, the input might be a file containing multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify. \n\n   Let me check the constraints: the string length is at most 100, and non-empty.\n\n   We are guaranteed that the string is non-empty.\n\n   But if there are multiple test cases, then the input format would be:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   Each test case on a new line.\n\n   And we must output:\n\n        0\n        3\n        2\n\n   Each on a new line.\n\n   But the problem says \"Output one number\", meaning one test case.\n\n   However, the example output is given as a list of numbers.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The first input line\", and then \"Output one number\", it suggests one test case.\n\n   But the sample input is given as a list of three strings, and the sample output as a list of three numbers.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n        \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   and \n\n        \"Output: Output one number\"\n\n   So if we are to process one string, then we output one number.\n\n   But the sample input example includes three strings. \n\n   I think the problem intended to show three examples, but the actual input is one string.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one string per run.\n\n   However, if the judge provides multiple test cases (each on a separate line), then we must read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I'll write the code to handle both:\n\n   Option 1: one test case (the common way in many problems is to have one test case per run).\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so we can read one line and process.\n\n   However, to be safe, let's check the problem constraints: the string length is at most 100 and non-empty.\n\n   If we are to process multiple test cases, then we can read until EOF. \n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify, and the sample input is provided as a list of three strings, but the problem says \"The first input line\", I think the intended input is one string.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format is standard.\n\n   In many competitions, the input may consist of multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\n   However, the problem statement here says \"The first input line\", which might imply that there is exactly one line.\n\n   Since the problem is from an unknown source, and the sample input is given as three strings, but the problem says \"first input line\", I will assume one string per run.\n\n   But wait, the sample input is written as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is the format of the input? Or is it the format of the example?\n\n   The problem says: \n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But then the output is:\n\n            ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So the input is three strings, and the output is three numbers.\n\n   This suggests that the input might have multiple test cases.\n\n   How to resolve?\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This is singular. \n\n   But then the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   I think the problem statement intended to say: \"The input contains several strings\", but wrote \"The first input line\" by mistake.\n\n   Or perhaps the example input is provided as a single string that contains commas and brackets? \n\n   But the example input is written with square brackets and commas, which is a representation.\n\n   Actually, in many problems, the sample input is shown as a list for clarity.\n\n   The real input would be:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   Or maybe:\n\n        ['abcd','ababa','zzz']\n\n   without the outer brackets? But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one line.\n\n   I think the intended input is one string per test case, and the example input is three separate test cases. \n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so if we are to process multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, I'll assume that the input may contain multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\n   How to do that?\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            # process s and output the answer\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The first input line\", so if there are multiple lines, then the first line is the first string, the second line the second string, etc.\n\n   And we output one number per test case.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"Output one number\", meaning for each test case we output one number.\n\n   But the example output is given as a list of three numbers. \n\n   Therefore, if the input has three test cases, we output three numbers.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The first input line\", it might be that there is only one test case. But the example input is three test cases.\n\n   I think the problem intended to provide one test case per run, but the example shows three separate examples.\n\n   However, to be safe and to match the sample output format (which is a list of numbers, but the problem says \"Output one number\"), I will assume one test case per run.\n\n   But the sample input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   Let me check the sample test 2: \n        Input: \"ababa\" -> Output: 3\n\n   And sample test 3: \"zzz\" -> Output: 2\n\n   So if we are given one string, we output one number.\n\n   Therefore, I'll write the code for one test case.\n\n   However, if the judge provides multiple test cases, we must read until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, I'll write two versions.\n\n   Version 1: one test case (read one string and output one number)\n\n   Version 2: multiple test cases (until EOF)\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so I think one test case.\n\n   But the sample input is given as three strings, so perhaps the judge will provide one string per line and we must process until EOF.\n\n   I decide to use the following: \n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        # If there is one line, then one string. If multiple, then multiple strings.\n\n        for s in data:\n            s = s.strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            # Then do the algorithm for s\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The first input line\", so if there are multiple lines, then the first line is the string, and the rest are not provided? \n\n   Actually, the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning the input has one line.\n\n   So if we read multiple lines, then we are processing multiple test cases, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n   Given the confusion, I think the intended input is one string.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n   I think the problem statement meant to say: \"You're given a string\" (singular) and the example input is just illustrative of the kind of inputs.\n\n   So I will assume one string per run.\n\n   However, the problem says \"competitive programming\", and in many competitive programming problems, the input may contain multiple test cases. \n\n   But the problem statement here explicitly says \"The first input line\", so I will follow that.\n\n   Therefore, we read one line.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # Then the algorithm\n\n   But wait, what if the input has spaces? The problem says the string consists of lower-case Latin letters. So no spaces.\n\n   However, the input is given in the first line, so we can safely use input().strip().\n\n   Let me submit the code for one test case.\n\n   But the sample input example has three test cases. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output: \n            ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This example is showing three separate examples. \n\n   The problem says: \"You're given a string\", meaning one string. \n\n   So the example is just showing three examples, not that the input will be three strings.\n\n   Therefore, I will assume one string per run.\n\n   Final code for one test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is given in the first input line. \n\n   So if we are running the program and the input is provided as:\n\n        abcd\n\n   Then we output 0.\n\n   If the input is:\n\n        ababa\n\n   Then we output 3.\n\n   If the input is:\n\n        zzz\n\n   Then we output 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, if the judge provides multiple test cases (each in its own line), then our code will fail because we read one line and then exit.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so I think the judge will provide one string per run.\n\n   But if the judge provides multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF.\n\n   To resolve this, I'll write a version that reads until EOF and processes each test case.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is given as a list of three strings, I think the judge might provide multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so one test case.\n\n   I decide to ask for clarification, but since I cannot, I'll write two versions and choose one.\n\n   But the problem says \"Output one number\", and if there are multiple test cases, then we output multiple numbers.\n\n   The problem statement does not specify.\n\n   After thinking, I recall that in many problems, the input format is one test case. But sometimes the problem says \"the first line\" and then the rest of the lines are part of the test case.\n\n   However, here the entire string is one line.\n\n   I think the intended solution is for one test case.\n\n   But to be safe, I'll write a version that reads until EOF and processes each line as a test case.\n\n   Then, if the judge provides one test case, we output one number.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases, we output one number per test case.\n\n   This matches the sample output format (a list of numbers) if we output each number on a separate line.\n\n   But the problem says \"Output one number\", meaning for the entire input.\n\n   However, if we have multiple test cases, then we output one number per test case.\n\n   The problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I choose to read until EOF and process each line.\n\n   Then, the sample input:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   would be processed as three test cases, and output:\n\n        0\n        3\n        2\n\n   Each on a new line.\n\n   This matches the sample output format (even though the sample output is given as a list, the actual output would be three lines).\n\n   But the problem says \"Output one number\", so if there are three test cases, we output three numbers.\n\n   This is acceptable if the problem intended multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, I change the code to read until EOF.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        results = []\n        for s in data:\n            s = s.strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            # If the string is empty, but guaranteed non-empty, so skip.\n            found = False\n            # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        results.append(str(L))\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if found:\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                results.append('0')\n\n        # Output each result on a separate line.\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"Output one number\", but if there are multiple test cases, we output multiple numbers. \n\n   However, the problem statement example output is given as a list of numbers, so this matches.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so if there is only one input line, then we output one number.\n\n   This code handles both.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", which might mean that the entire input is one line (containing the string). But then we are reading multiple lines.\n\n   But if the input is one line, then data will have one element.\n\n   This code works.\n\n   But note: the input might have empty lines. The problem says the string is non-empty, but what if the input has empty lines? \n\n   We are stripping each line, so if a line is empty, then s becomes '' and n=0, then the loop for L from -1 to 0? Actually, for n=0, range(-1,0,-1) is empty, so we append '0'. \n\n   But the problem says non-empty string. \n\n   We can assume there are no empty lines, but the problem says the string is non-empty.\n\n   Alternatively, we can skip empty lines.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", so there should be no empty lines.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can skip empty lines.\n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty, so every line that is not empty is a test case?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of each possible length and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest substring that repeats at least once in the input string. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of decreasing lengths from the longest possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current length as the result since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n2. **Intuition**: By starting from the largest possible substring length and decrementing, we ensure that the first duplicate found corresponds to the longest valid substring. This approach leverages the fact that longer substrings are less likely to repeat, so checking from the top down optimizes the solution.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating over possible substring lengths from the maximum (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates using a set. The first duplicate found during this process gives the solution.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (iterating over lengths and then over each substring). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    results = []\n    for s in data:\n        s = s.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            results.append('0')\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    results.append(str(L))\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        if not found:\n            results.append('0')\n            \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines. Each line is processed as a separate test case.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each string, the algorithm checks all possible substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 1.\n3. **Checking for Duplicates**: For each substring length, the algorithm generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates using a set. If a duplicate is found, the current length is recorded as the result for that test case, and the loop exits early.\n4. **Output**: Results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line. If no duplicate is found for a test case, the result is 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
