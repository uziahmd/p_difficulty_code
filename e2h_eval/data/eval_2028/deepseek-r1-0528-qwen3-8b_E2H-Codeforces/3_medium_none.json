Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap in the middle is from a_i + d to a_{i+1} - d.\n        To cover the entire street, the light from one lantern must extend to the next. So the distance between the two lanterns is (a_{i+1} - a_i). \n        The light from the left lantern must cover up to at least a_{i+1} - d, so the condition is: d must be at least (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for the gap to be covered?\n\n Actually, note: if we have two lanterns at positions x and y (x <= y), then the entire segment [x-d, x+d] and [y-d, y+d] must cover [x, y] without gap.\n The gap between the two lanterns is from x+d to y-d. For no gap, we require x+d >= y-d, i.e., 2*d >= y - x.\n\n Therefore, for each gap between consecutive lanterns, we require d >= (gap)/2.\n\n But note: the entire street must be lit. The whole street is from 0 to l.\n\n Steps:\n   Let sorted_positions = sorted(ai)\n\n   Consider:\n     d1 = (sorted_positions[0] - 0) / 2.0   [covers from 0 to sorted_positions[0]]\n     d2 = (l - sorted_positions[-1]) / 2.0   [covers from sorted_positions[-1] to l]\n\n   For gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n     For i from 0 to n-2:\n         gap = sorted_positions[i+1] - sorted_positions[i]\n         d3 = gap / 2.0\n\n   Then the answer is the maximum of these values because we need to cover the entire street.\n\n However, note: the requirement for covering the gaps is not just half the gap, but we must ensure that the lights from adjacent lanterns meet.\n\n Actually, the above reasoning is correct for the gaps: the light from the left lantern must extend to at least the midpoint? Not exactly.\n\n Example: two lanterns at [1, 3] and the street from 0 to 4.\n   Without the ends, the gap between 1 and 3 is 2. The minimal d to cover the gap is 1 (because the left lantern must cover from 1 to 1+d, and the right from 3-d to 3. We require 1+d >= 3-d -> 2*d >= 2 -> d>=1).\n\n But also consider the ends: \n   Left end: from 0 to 1 -> requires d >= 0.5 (if we set d=0.5, then the left lantern covers [0.5, 1.5] which doesn't cover 0 to 1? Actually, wait: the left lantern at 1 with d=0.5 covers [0.5, 1.5]. So the point 0 is not covered. Hence, we need d >= 1 to cover from 0 to 1 (since 1 - d >= 0 => d<=1, but actually we require that the left lantern's coverage starts at 0: 1 - d <= 0 -> d>=1? Actually, we require that the left lantern's coverage extends from 1-d to 1+d. To cover 0, we need 1-d <= 0 -> d>=1. Similarly, to cover the right end (4): we need 3+d >=4 -> d>=1.\n\n Now, if we set d=1, then:\n   Left lantern at 1: covers [0, 2]\n   Right lantern at 3: covers [2,4]\n   So the entire street [0,4] is covered.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the minimal d must be at least max( (positions[0]-0)/2, (l - positions[-1])/2, (gaps)/2 ) for each gap.\n\n However, note: the gaps between consecutive lanterns: the condition is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the entire segment between them. The condition is that the right lantern's left coverage must meet the left lantern's right coverage.\n\n Specifically, the left lantern at a_i covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern at a_{i+1} covers from a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, so d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n But wait, what about the entire street? Actually, the entire street is covered if:\n   - From 0 to the first lantern: the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The coverage from the first lantern is [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. But note: if d is large enough, the first lantern might be more than a0 away from 0, but then the coverage is from 0 to a0+d. However, we don't require that the first lantern alone covers 0, but the entire street. Actually, the requirement is that the light must cover 0. So the first lantern must have d at least a0 (if we only use the first lantern) but we might have multiple lanterns. However, the minimal d must be such that the leftmost point (0) is covered by some lantern. The closest lantern to 0 is the first one, so we require d >= a0 (if we use the first lantern to cover 0) but wait, maybe a lantern further to the right can help? Actually, no: the light from a lantern at position a_i can only cover from a_i-d to a_i+d. To cover 0, we must have a_i-d <= 0 for some i. The smallest a_i is a0, so we require d>=a0 (if we use the first lantern) or if there is a lantern closer to 0, but the first is the closest. However, note: if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. But the next lantern might not be necessary for the left side? Actually, the entire street is from 0 to l.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire street is lit by one lantern. We can have overlapping coverage.\n\n Let me reframe: the entire street must be covered by the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n\n Conditions:\n   Condition 1: The leftmost point 0 must be covered: there exists an i such that a_i - d <= 0 <= a_i + d. Since the first lantern is the closest to 0, the minimal d to cover 0 is d >= a0 (if we use the first lantern). But wait, if we have a lantern at 0, then d can be 0. But if the first lantern is at a0>0, then we require d >= a0? Actually, no: the coverage from the first lantern extends from a0-d to a0+d. For 0 to be covered, we require a0-d <= 0, so d>=a0. But wait, that would mean if we set d=a0, then the first lantern covers from 0 to 2*a0. However, consider if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. What if the next lantern is very far? Actually, the entire street is from 0 to l. We must cover up to l.\n\n Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n   The entire street must be covered. We can break the problem into segments:\n\n   Segment 1: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position. The coverage from the first lantern to the left is from (first_lantern - d) to (first_lantern + d). So to cover 0, we require first_lantern - d <= 0 -> d >= first_lantern.\n\n   But wait, that is not the same as the example above. In the example [2,5] for n=2, l=5, the first lantern is at 2. Then according to this, d>=2. Then the second sample output is 2.0.\n\n   However, consider if we set d=2, then the first lantern (at 2) covers [0,4] and the second lantern (at 5) covers [3,7]. The street is from 0 to 5. The point 0 is covered (by the first lantern: 2-2=0). The point 5 is covered by the second lantern (5-2=3, but wait 3 to 7: so 5 is covered). But the gap between the first and second lantern: the first lantern covers up to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3. So 3 to 4 is covered by both. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   However, note: the requirement for the leftmost part is d>=2 (from the first lantern) and for the rightmost part is d>= (5-5)=0. And for the gap between 2 and 5: d>= (5-2)/2 = 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2.\n\n   But wait, in the example with two lanterns at [1,3] and street from 0 to 4: \n        Condition1: d >= 1 (to cover 0)\n        Condition2: d >= (4-3)=1 (to cover the right end)\n        Condition3: d >= (3-1)/2 = 1\n        So d=1.\n\n   However, if we set d=1, then the first lantern (at 1) covers [0,2] and the second lantern (at 3) covers [2,4]. This covers the entire street.\n\n   But wait, the leftmost condition: d>=1 is correct because 1-d<=0 -> d>=1. The rightmost condition: d>= (4-3)=1. The gap condition: d>= (3-1)/2=1.\n\n   So the formula is: \n        candidate1 = (positions[0] - 0)   # for the left end: the entire left segment [0, positions[0]] must be covered by the first lantern? Actually, no: the first lantern's left coverage is from (positions[0]-d) to (positions[0]+d). To cover 0, we require positions[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=positions[0]. However, note that if there is a lantern at 0, then d>=0, but the condition above uses the first lantern's position. \n\n   But wait, consider if there are multiple lanterns: the first lantern might not be the one that covers 0? Actually, the first lantern is the closest to 0. However, if we have a lantern at 0, then the first lantern is 0, and then d>=0. But what if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition for the left end is satisfied for any d>=0.\n\n   However, note: the entire street must be covered. The left end is 0, and the first lantern is at 0, so even if d=0, the point 0 is covered. But then we must cover from 0 to l.\n\n   So the conditions are:\n\n   Condition 1: d must be at least the maximum of:\n        (a) (positions[0])   [to cover from 0 to the first lantern? Actually, no: the first lantern must extend to the left to 0, so d must be at least positions[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0)].\n\n   Condition 2: d must be at least the maximum of:\n        (b) (l - positions[-1])\n\n   Condition 3: for each gap between consecutive lanterns, d must be at least (positions[i+1] - positions[i]) / 2.0\n\n   Then the answer is the maximum of these three.\n\n   However, wait: Condition 1: the first lantern must cover the segment from 0 to ... but actually, the first lantern might not be the one that covers the entire left part if there is a lantern to the right that can cover the left part? But note: the first lantern is the closest to 0, so the leftmost uncovered point without the first lantern would be 0. Therefore, the first lantern must cover the part from 0 to at least its own position.\n\n   But wait, if we have multiple lanterns, could the second lantern help cover the left part? No, because the second lantern is further to the right. So the first lantern is the only one that can cover the left end.\n\n   However, note: if we have two lanterns: [0, 5] and l=10, then the first lantern at 0 requires d>=0 (so no constraint from the left end). The right end requires d>=5. The gap requires d>= (5-0)/2 = 2.5. So the maximum is 5.\n\n   With d=5, the first lantern covers [-5,5] (but our street is [0,10]), so from 0 to 5. The second lantern at 5 covers [0,10] (since 5-5=0, 5+5=10). So indeed the entire street is covered.\n\n   But note: the condition for the left end is d>=0, which is trivial. The condition for the right end is d>=5, which is the main constraint.\n\n   So the conditions are:\n\n        candidate_left = positions[0] - 0   [Actually, to cover 0, we require d >= (positions[0] - 0) if we use the first lantern? But wait, the first lantern's coverage to the left is from positions[0]-d to positions[0]+d. To cover 0, we require positions[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=positions[0]. However, if there is a lantern at 0, then we require d>=0, but the condition d>=positions[0] (which is 0) is satisfied.\n\n   However, consider: if the first lantern is at 0, then we require d>=0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition for the left end is 0, but what if we have a lantern at 0 and another at 5, then the left end is covered by the lantern at 0. The condition for the left end is d>=0, which is always true.\n\n   But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d>=positions[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0). However, note that the entire street must be covered. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern. But the first lantern also covers to the right. However, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n        (a) positions[0] (to cover the left end 0)\n        (b) (l - positions[-1]) (to cover the right end)\n        (c) (gaps)/2 for each gap (to cover the gaps between consecutive lanterns)\n\n   But wait, consider the example [1,3] and l=4: \n        (a) 1 -> d>=1\n        (b) 4-3=1 -> d>=1\n        (c) (3-1)/2=1 -> d>=1\n\n   Then the answer is 1.\n\n   However, consider if the lanterns are not placed at the edges. What if we have lanterns at [1, 2, 3, 4] and l=5?\n        Condition (a): 1 -> d>=1\n        Condition (b): 5-4=1 -> d>=1\n        Condition (c): gaps: (2-1)/2=0.5, (3-2)/2=0.5, (4-3)/2=0.5 -> maximum is 0.5\n        Then the answer is 1.\n\n   But let's check: with d=1, the first lantern (1) covers [0,2], the second (2) covers [1,3], the third (3) covers [2,4], the fourth (4) covers [3,5]. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   However, note: the condition (a) is actually not the entire story. The condition (a) is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern. But if d=0.5, then the first lantern (at 1) covers [0.5, 1.5]. Then 0 is not covered. So condition (a) is correct: d>=1.\n\n   But wait, why condition (a) is positions[0]? Because the first lantern must extend from its position to the left by at least positions[0] to cover 0? Actually, the distance from the first lantern to 0 is positions[0] (since the first lantern is at positions[0] and 0 is at 0). So the required d is at least positions[0] to cover 0.\n\n   However, consider: if the first lantern is at 0, then we don't need any d from the left? But note, the condition (a) becomes 0, so it's okay.\n\n   But wait, there's an alternative way: sometimes we can use the gap condition to cover the left end. Actually, no: the left end is fixed at 0 and the first lantern is the closest to 0. The minimal d required to cover 0 is the distance from the first lantern to 0, i.e., positions[0]. Similarly, the minimal d required to cover the right end is the distance from the last lantern to l, i.e., l - positions[-1].\n\n   However, note: if we have two lanterns: [0,5] and l=10, then the condition (a) is 0 (since the first lantern is at 0) and condition (b) is 5. Then the answer is 5.\n\n   But what if the street is [0, 10] and we have lanterns at [0, 10]? Then condition (a)=0, condition (b)=0, and gaps: (10-0)/2=5 -> so d>=5. Then the answer is 5. Correct.\n\n   However, what if the lanterns are at [0, 5, 10] and l=10? Then condition (a)=0, condition (b)=0, and gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5. Then d>=2.5.\n\n   Check: with d=2.5, the first lantern at 0: [-2.5,2.5] -> covers [0,2.5] (since negative part is irrelevant). Second lantern at 5: [2.5,7.5]. Third lantern at 10: [7.5,12.5]. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a lantern at 0 and then a gap of 5, then we require d>=2.5 to cover the gap from 0 to 5. Then the lantern at 0 must cover up to 2.5, and the next lantern at 5 must start at 5-2.5=2.5. So they meet.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        sort the list of lanterns\n        candidates = []\n        # left end\n        if n == 0:\n            # but n>=1 per input, so skip\n            pass\n        else:\n            candidates.append(positions[0])   # to cover the left end: from 0 to the first lantern, we need d >= positions[0]\n            candidates.append(l - positions[-1]) # to cover the right end: from the last lantern to l, we need d >= (l - positions[-1])\n\n            # gaps between consecutive lanterns\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n                # The required d to cover the gap is gap/2.0\n                candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        answer = max(candidates)\n\n   However, wait: the left end condition: we require d >= positions[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0). Similarly, the right end condition: d >= (l - positions[-1]). And the gaps: d >= (gap)/2.\n\n   But note: the gap condition is independent. The entire street is covered if we satisfy all conditions, so we take the maximum.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        n=7, l=15, positions = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15] (after sorting)\n\n        Left end: 0\n        Right end: 15-15 = 0\n        Gaps: \n            3-0 -> 3/2=1.5\n            5-3 -> 2/2=1.0\n            7-5 -> 2/2=1.0\n            9-7 -> 2/2=1.0\n            14-9 -> 5/2=2.5\n            15-14 -> 1/2=0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n        Output: 2.5000000000 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        n=2, l=5, positions=[2,5]\n        Left end: 2\n        Right end: 5-5=0\n        Gap: (5-2)/2=1.5\n        Then maximum: max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> matches.\n\n   However, wait: the second sample input was given as \"2 5\\n2 5\", and the output is 2.0.\n\n   But note: the example in the note: \n        Input: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n        Output: ['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n   However, wait: the example note says: \n        Consider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\n   But wait, the second sample input: \n        n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\n   With d=2, the first lantern (at 2) covers [0,4] and the second lantern (at 5) covers [3,7]. The street is [0,5]. The point 5 is covered by the second lantern (because 5 is in [3,7]). The point 4 is covered by the first lantern and 3 is covered by both. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   Our method gives 2.0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the gap condition for the second sample: (5-2)/2=1.5, but we found that d=2 is needed. Why didn't the gap condition require 2? \n\n   Actually, the gap condition is: the two lanterns must meet in the middle. The gap is 3 (from 2 to 5). The condition is d >= 3/2 = 1.5. But then why did we get 2 from the left end condition?\n\n   The left end condition: the first lantern must cover from 0 to 2. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is 2, so we require d>=2.\n\n   So the maximum of 2 (left end) and 1.5 (gap) is 2.\n\n   Therefore, the conditions are independent and we must take the maximum.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a lantern in the middle? The left end condition and the gap condition might be different.\n\n   Another example: n=3, l=10, lanterns at [0, 5, 10]. \n        Left end: 0\n        Right end: 0\n        Gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5 -> so answer=2.5.\n\n   Now, if we set d=2.5, then:\n        First lantern: [ -2.5, 2.5] -> covers [0,2.5]\n        Second lantern: [2.5,7.5]\n        Third lantern: [7.5,12.5]\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But what if we set d=2? \n        First lantern: [-2,2] -> covers [0,2] (since negative part is ignored, but our street starts at 0)\n        Second lantern: [3,7]\n        Third lantern: [8,12] -> so the point 2 to 3 is not covered, and 7 to 8 is not covered. So indeed we need 2.5.\n\n   Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n        d_min = max( \n            positions[0] - 0, \n            l - positions[-1],\n            max( (positions[i+1] - positions[i]) / 2.0 for i in range(n-1) ) \n        )\n\n   However, note: the left end condition is the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is positions[0] (if we use the first lantern). But what if we have multiple lanterns and the first lantern is not the one that covers 0? Actually, the first lantern is the one closest to 0, so it is the one that must cover 0.\n\n   But wait: what if the street has a lantern at 0? Then positions[0]=0, so condition is 0.\n\n   One more edge: n=1, l=5, lantern at [3]\n        Then left end: 3\n        Right end: 5-3=2\n        There are no gaps.\n        Then answer = max(3,2) = 3.\n\n        Check: with d=3, the lantern at 3 covers [0,6]. The street is [0,5] -> covered.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the right end: the lantern must cover from 3 to 5. The distance from 3 to 5 is 2, so d>=2. The left end requires d>=3. So the maximum is 3.\n\n   However, is 3 the minimal? Yes, because without d>=3, the left end (0) is not covered: 3-d < 0 -> d>3. Actually, to cover 0: 3-d <= 0 -> d>=3. So yes.\n\n   But note: the condition for the left end is the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is 3. The condition for the right end is the distance from the last lantern to l, which is 2. The gap condition is absent. So the answer is 3.\n\n   However, wait: the entire street is [0,5]. The lantern is at 3. With d=3, it covers [0,6] which includes [0,5]. But we can do with d=2.5? Let's check: \n        d=2.5: the lantern at 3 covers [0.5,5.5]. Then 0 is not covered (0.5>0). So d must be at least 3 to cover 0.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        Read n, l\n        Read the list of n integers, sort them.\n\n        candidates = []\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0.0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        candidates.append(positions[0])   # left end\n        candidates.append(l - positions[-1]) # right end\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n\n        Format ans to have 4 decimal places or as per the problem: absolute or relative error <= 1e-9.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer must have absolute or relative error <= 1e-9. We can use formatting to output with 10 decimal places.\n\n   But wait: the example outputs have 10 decimal places. We can use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But note: if the maximum is an integer, we want to output 2.0000000000.\n\n   Let's test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: 2.5 -> 2.5000000000\n   Example 2: 2.0 -> 2.0000000000\n\n   However, what if the maximum is an integer? We should output the float with 10 decimal places.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a_list.sort()\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we have to cover from 0 to l.\n        # But the above conditions still hold.\n\n        candidates.append(a_list[0])\n        candidates.append(l - a_list[-1])\n\n        for i in range(len(a_list)-1):\n            gap = a_list[i+1] - a_list[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait, what if n==0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't need to handle n==0.\n\n   However, let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        Output: 2.5 -> formatted to 2.5000000000\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        Output: 2.0 -> formatted to 2.0000000000\n\n   But wait, the first example input: \n        n=7, l=15, and the list [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] -> sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        candidates: \n            left = 0\n            right = 15-15=0\n            gaps: (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1, (7-5)/2=1, (9-7)/2=1, (14-9)/2=2.5, (15-14)/2=0.5\n            max = 2.5\n\n   Example 2: \n        n=2, l=5, list [2,5] -> sorted [2,5]\n        left = 2\n        right = 5-5=0\n        gap: (5-2)/2=1.5\n        max(2,0,1.5)=2\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, wait: what if the street is [0, 10] and we have one lantern at 5?\n        n=1, l=10, a_list=[5]\n        candidates: left=5, right=10-5=5, and no gaps.\n        ans = 5.\n\n        Check: d=5, the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] (from 0 to 10). Correct.\n\n   Another test: n=3, l=10, a_list=[0,5,10]\n        left=0, right=0, gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5 -> ans=2.5.\n\n   One more: n=2, l=10, a_list=[0,10]\n        left=0, right=0, gap=(10-0)/2=5 -> ans=5.\n\n   But wait, with d=5: \n        The first lantern at 0: [-5,5] -> so from 0 to 5 is covered (the street is from 0 to 10, so the part [0,5] is covered).\n        The second lantern at 10: [5,15] -> so from 5 to 10 is covered (and beyond). \n        So the entire street is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a_list.sort()\n\n        candidates = [a_list[0], l - a_list[-1]]\n\n        for i in range(len(a_list)-1):\n            candidates.append((a_list[i+1] - a_list[i]) / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait, what if the list has duplicate lanterns? The problem says: \"Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point.\" \n\n   Example: n=2, l=10, a_list=[5,5]\n        left=5, right=10-5=5, gap=(5-5)/2=0 -> ans=5.\n\n        Check: with d=5, the lanterns at 5 cover [0,10] and [0,10] (each). The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   So duplicates are handled because the gap condition for two same points is 0, which doesn't affect the maximum.\n\n   However, note: if we have duplicates, the gaps between duplicates are zero, so the condition for the gap is 0. But the left end and right end conditions are still the same.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But wait: what if the street is [0, 10] and we have lanterns at [0, 10] and also one at 5? \n        n=3, l=10, a_list=[0,5,10]\n        left=0, right=0, gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5 -> ans=2.5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the street length is l, and the lanterns are at positions from 0 to l. The endpoints are included.\n\n   One last test: n=1, l=0? \n        But the input constraints: n>=1, l>=1. So we don't have to worry about l=0.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a_list.sort()\n\n        candidates = [a_list[0], l - a_list[-1]]\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then the for loop won't run (n-1=0)\n        for i in range(len(a_list)-1):\n            gap = a_list[i+1] - a_list[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   However, note: if n==0, the input n>=1, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: the first line contains n, l (1<=n<=1000, 1<=l<=10^9). So n>=1.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, let me check the example with one lantern: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\"\n        Output: 5.0 -> 5.0000000000\n\n   But wait, the condition: \n        left = 5, right = 10-5=5, no gaps -> ans=5.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Submit.\n\n   But wait, I just thought: the left end condition is the entire left part must be covered. The left end condition is the distance from the first lantern to 0. But what if the first lantern is not the one that covers the left end? Actually, the first",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to light the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves covering a street of length `l` with `n` lanterns positioned at various points. The key observation is that the street must be entirely covered by the union of intervals `[ai - d, ai + d]` for each lantern at position `ai`. The solution requires finding the minimal `d` that ensures no segment of the street remains unlit.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal `d` is determined by three factors:\n   - **Leftmost Segment**: The distance from the first lantern (closest to 0) to the start of the street (0). This requires `d` to be at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - **Rightmost Segment**: The distance from the last lantern (closest to `l`) to the end of the street (`l`). This requires `d` to be at least `l - position of the last lantern`.\n   - **Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The required `d` here is half the distance between them (i.e., `(ai+1 - ai)/2`).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves sorting the lantern positions to systematically evaluate the leftmost, rightmost, and inter-lantern gaps. The minimal `d` is the maximum value derived from these three categories.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 1000`. The subsequent steps involve linear scans, making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is optimal for this problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    \n    candidates = [a_list[0], l - a_list[-1]]\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)-1):\n        gap = a_list[i+1] - a_list[i]\n        candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n        \n    ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of the leftmost, rightmost, and inter-lantern gaps.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - The leftmost candidate is the position of the first lantern (distance from 0).\n   - The rightmost candidate is the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the required `d` is half the gap length.\n4. **Result Determination**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among all candidates, ensuring all segments of the street are covered.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal light radius by leveraging sorting and linear scans, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
