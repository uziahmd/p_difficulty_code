Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. We need to check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight lines connecting each spaceship to its base do not intersect.\n\n Conditions:\n - Each base must be connected to exactly one spaceship and vice versa.\n - The straight lines (in the galaxy plane) must not intersect (except at the endpoints, which are distinct points).\n\n Note: It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.\n\n Since R, B <= 10, we can try to use a combinatorial approach. However, checking all possible matchings (which would be factorial in min(R,B)) might be acceptable because 10! is about 3.6 million, but note that we have two sets of points (spaceships and bases) and we are matching them. Actually, the number of matchings is factorial in the minimum of R and B, so for 10 it's 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case if we can check each matching quickly.\n\n However, note that the problem requires that the straight lines do not intersect. But note: the condition is that the two paths (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. Since we are drawing straight lines from a base to a spaceship, we must ensure that the set of line segments (each being from a base to a spaceship) does not have any crossing.\n\n Important: The problem does not require that the entire set of points forms a planar graph, but only that the chosen matching (the set of line segments) does not have any intersections.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read input: first line has R and B, then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n 2. We have two sets: S (spaceships) and Bases (bases). We want to assign each base to a spaceship (or equivalently, each spaceship to a base) such that the set of line segments connecting each base to its spaceship do not cross.\n\n 3. How to check for non-intersection of two line segments?\n    We can use the standard method: for two segments (A-B) and (C-D), they intersect if the points C and D lie on opposite sides of the line AB, and A and B lie on opposite sides of the line CD. However, note: our segments are from a base to a spaceship, and we are only concerned with the matching.\n\n 4. But note: the entire matching consists of multiple segments. We must check that no two segments (from different pairs) intersect, except at their endpoints.\n\n 5. However, note: the condition is that the two paths (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. This means that we must check for every pair of edges (i.e., two distinct assignments) whether they cross.\n\n 6. Approach:\n\n   Option 1: Generate all perfect matchings (if R == B) or if R != B, then we cannot have a perfect matching? Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we require R == B? \n\n   Let me read the problem: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies that we must have R == B. Otherwise, the assignment cannot be a perfect matching (since the bases must have one and the spaceships must have one). Therefore, if R != B, we immediately output 'No'.\n\n   But wait: the example input format: \n        Input: ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n   The second example: R=2, B=1 -> output 'No'. So indeed, if R != B, then no matching exists (because one base must have one spaceship and vice versa, so we need |R|==|B|). Therefore, we can assume that the problem only gives inputs where R==B, or we must check.\n\n   The problem states: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format. So we should handle the case when R != B.\n\n   According to the problem statement: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\", so the matching must be bijective. Hence, if R != B, it's impossible.\n\n   Therefore, first check: if R != B, output 'No'.\n\n   Then, if R == B, we consider all permutations of the bases (or all matchings) and check if there exists one matching such that the set of segments (from base i to spaceship j, where j is the assigned one) do not intersect.\n\n 7. However, note: the problem does not specify which points are bases and which are spaceships, but the input order: first R spaceships, then B bases.\n\n 8. Algorithm for checking non-intersection for a matching:\n\n   Given a matching, we have a set of segments: for each base i, we assign it to a spaceship j. Then we have the segment (base_i, spaceship_j). We need to check that no two segments (except at endpoints) cross.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   For each pair of segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) (with distinct endpoints), check if they intersect.\n\n   But note: the segments are defined by two distinct pairs. We must avoid checking the same segment twice and also avoid checking the same point.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the entire set of segments and check for crossings.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. So even if two segments share an endpoint, that is allowed? Actually, the problem says \"do not intersect\" and the endpoints are distinct. But note: two segments that share an endpoint are adjacent and that endpoint is common. The problem likely considers that sharing an endpoint is allowed (as long as the interior of the segments don't cross). \n\n   But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two distinct paths. And the paths are from base to spaceship. So two distinct paths that share an endpoint are okay, because they meet at the endpoint. However, the condition is that they do not intersect in the interior.\n\n   So we must check that for any two distinct segments, they do not share an interior point.\n\n   Standard way: use the cross product to check if two segments intersect.\n\n   We can define a function:\n\n   def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        # Check if segments (a, b) and (c, d) intersect (including endpoints? but we know the endpoints are distinct and we want to ignore if they share an endpoint? Actually, if two segments share an endpoint, then that endpoint is common and we don't consider that as an intersection? \n\n        However, note: the entire matching uses distinct points (no two points coincide). So the only common points between two segments are the endpoints that are shared. But in our matching, two segments will share an endpoint only if the base or the spaceship is the same? Actually, no: each base is used once and each spaceship is used once. Therefore, two segments (from base i to spaceship j) and (base k to spaceship l) will share an endpoint only if either base i = base k (but that would be the same base, which is not allowed because base i is assigned to j and base k is assigned to l, and we use each base once) or if base i = spaceship l or base k = spaceship j, etc. \n\n        Actually, the endpoints are distinct. The set of points is the union of the two sets: S (spaceships) and B (bases). There are R+B points. In the matching, we use each base and each spaceship exactly once, so the segments are:\n\n            base0 -> spaceship_j0\n            base1 -> spaceship_j1\n            ...\n\n        The endpoints are distinct because the bases and spaceships are distinct sets (the problem says \"no two points coincide\"). \n\n        However, wait: the input says \"no two points coincide\", so the entire set of R+B points are distinct.\n\n        Therefore, two segments (base_i, spaceship_j) and (base_k, spaceship_l) have four distinct endpoints. So they don't share an endpoint.\n\n        Then we can check using the standard method for segment intersection.\n\n   Standard method for two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4):\n\n        We can use the orientation method.\n\n        Let A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), C = (x3, y3), D = (x4, y4)\n\n        We say that the segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n          (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations (one clockwise and one counterclockwise) AND\n          (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n        However, note: if the segments are collinear, then we must check for overlap. But the problem states that no three points are collinear. So we don't have to worry about collinear segments.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n        def orient(a, b, c):\n            # returns the cross product of (b-a) and (c-a)\n            return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n        Then, two segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if:\n\n          o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n          o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n          o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n          o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n          and (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        But note: the above condition is for proper intersection (not including the case when the endpoints are colinear, but we know no three are colinear, so endpoints are distinct and the segments are not overlapping).\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the above condition is necessary and sufficient for two segments to intersect at an interior point, given that no three points are collinear.\n\n 9. Now, for a given matching (which is a permutation: we assign base i to spaceship perm[i]), we have R segments. We must check that no two of these segments intersect.\n\n 10. How to check for the entire matching?\n\n        Let the matching be represented by an array `perm` of length R (if we consider the bases as fixed and we assign base i to spaceship perm[i]). But note: the bases are given in a list, and we have to assign each base to one spaceship.\n\n        Actually, we have R spaceships and R bases. We can index the bases from 0 to R-1 and the spaceships from 0 to R-1 (but wait: the input gives R spaceships and then B bases, and we know R==B). So we can:\n\n        Let:\n          spaceships = [ (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ... ]  (first R lines after the first line)\n          bases = [ (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ... ]         (next R lines)\n\n        Then, we want to assign each base (index i) to a spaceship (index j). We can generate all permutations of [0, 1, ..., R-1] and check for each permutation if the matching (base i -> spaceship[perm[i]]) yields non-intersecting segments.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\n          Step 2: Read the next R lines for spaceships, then B (which is R) lines for bases.\n\n          Step 3: Generate all permutations of range(R). For each permutation p:\n\n                  segments = []\n                  for i in range(R):\n                      base_i = bases[i]\n                      spaceship_j = spaceships[p[i]]\n                      segments.append( (base_i, spaceship_j) )\n\n                  Then check if the set of segments has any two that intersect.\n\n          Step 4: If we find one permutation for which none of the segments intersect, output 'Yes'. If none of the permutations work, output 'No'.\n\n 11. Complexity: There are R! permutations, and for each permutation we check C(R,2) pairs of segments (each pair of segments we do 4 orientation checks). Since R<=10, the maximum number of permutations is 10! = 3628800, and for each permutation we check up to 45 pairs (for R=10, the number of pairs is C(10,2)=45). For each pair, 4 orientation checks (each orientation is a few multiplications). This is acceptable.\n\n 12. However, note: the problem says that the bases and spaceships are given, but the matching is from base i to spaceship j. We are generating all permutations of the assignment.\n\n 13. Implementation:\n\n        Read input:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n        if not data: \n            print('No')\n            exit(0)\n\n        r = int(data[0]); b = int(data[1])\n        if r != b:\n            print('No')\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Then read the next r*2 numbers for spaceships\n        index = 2\n        spaceships = []\n        for i in range(r):\n            x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n            spaceships.append((x,y))\n\n        bases = []\n        for i in range(b):\n            x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n            bases.append((x,y))\n\n        Then, we need to generate all permutations of [0, 1, ..., r-1] and for each permutation p, we form the matching.\n\n        Then, for the matching, we have a list of segments: [ (bases[i], spaceships[p[i]]) for i in range(r) ]\n\n        Then, we check for any two distinct segments (i, j) and (k, l) (with i<k) whether they intersect.\n\n        Note: We must check all unordered pairs of distinct segments.\n\n        How to check for a list of segments?\n\n            n = r (number of segments)\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i+1, n):\n                    if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                        break out of inner loop (this matching is invalid)\n                if we didn't break, then this matching is valid.\n\n        Then, if we found a valid matching, we break and output 'Yes'. Otherwise, after all permutations, output 'No'.\n\n 14. Write the helper function for segment intersection:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # a, b, c, d are tuples (x,y)\n            # Check if segments (a->b) and (c->d) intersect.\n\n            # Using cross products for orientation.\n\n            def orient(o, a, b):\n                # Returns the cross product of vectors OA and OB\n                oa_x = a[0] - o[0]\n                oa_y = a[1] - o[1]\n                ob_x = b[0] - o[0]\n                ob_y = b[1] - o[1]\n                return oa_x * ob_y - oa_y * ob_x\n\n            # We'll check the orientations of the points with respect to the two segments.\n\n            o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n            o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n            o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n            # General case: if the orientations are different for both pairs, then they intersect.\n            # But note: if the two segments are collinear, then we would have o1,o2,o3,o4 ==0. But the problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n            # However, we must also consider the possibility that one of the endpoints lies on the other segment. But wait, the condition for intersection of two segments (including endpoints) is that the orientations are such that one is zero. But the problem says \"do not intersect\", meaning we don't want any intersection (even at endpoints). However, note that the endpoints are distinct and the matching uses distinct points, so the only way two segments share an endpoint is if the base or spaceship points are shared. But in our matching, the base and spaceship points are distinct and the segments are defined by distinct pairs. However, note: the entire set of points (bases and spaceships) is distinct, so the four endpoints of two different segments are distinct. Therefore, an endpoint of one segment cannot lie on the other segment (unless by accident, but the condition for lying on the segment is that the orientation is zero and the point lies between the two endpoints). But the problem states no three points are collinear, so the only way an endpoint lies on the other segment is if the segment is degenerate, which is not the case because we have four distinct points and no three collinear. \n\n            # Actually, the condition of the problem: \"no three points are on the same line\". So even if we take two segments, the four endpoints are distinct and no three are collinear, so an endpoint cannot lie on the other segment (because that would require three collinear points: for example, if base_i and base_j lie on the segment (spaceship_k, spaceship_l) then we have four points, but the condition is no three collinear, so base_i and base_j and one of the spaceship_k or spaceship_l would be collinear, which is forbidden). \n\n            # Therefore, we can assume that no endpoint lies on the interior of the other segment. Moreover, the segments do not share any endpoint. So the only way two segments can intersect is by crossing in the interior.\n\n            # Then, the condition is: \n            #   (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n            # But note: the orientation can be positive (counterclockwise) or negative (clockwise). The product being negative means one is positive and the other negative.\n\n            return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n 15. However, wait: what if the segments are not given in a particular order? Our function `orient` works regardless.\n\n 16. But note: the above condition is standard for checking proper intersection (interior). However, we must also consider the case when the segments are given in reverse order? Actually, the function is symmetric.\n\n 17. Let me test with a known example:\n\n        Example: two segments that cross.\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n        Segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        For segment1: (0,0) to (2,2), and segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        Check segment1 with segment2:\n\n        For segment1: \n          o1 = orient((0,0),(2,2),(0,2)) \n             = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) ? Wait, let me recast the orient function:\n\n        Actually, the standard orient function is:\n\n          def orient(a, b, c):\n              return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n        Then:\n\n          o1 = orient((0,0),(2,2),(0,2)) \n               = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) -> wait, no:\n\n          Actually, we have:\n            a = (0,0), b = (2,2), c = (0,2)\n            dx1 = 2, dy1 = 2\n            dx2 = 0, dy2 = 2\n            = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4\n\n          o2 = orient((0,0),(2,2),(2,0))\n               = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*0 - 2*2 = -4\n\n          So o1 * o2 = 4 * (-4) = -16 < 0 -> good.\n\n          Now for the other segment (segment2) with respect to segment1's endpoints:\n\n          o3 = orient((0,2),(2,0),(0,0))\n               = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) = 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4\n          o4 = orient((0,2),(2,0),(2,2))\n               = (2-0)*(2-2) - (0-2)*(2-0) = 2*0 - (-2)*2 = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n          o3 * o4 = -4 * 4 = -16 < 0 -> good.\n\n          So returns True.\n\n        Example of two segments that do not cross:\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n        Segment2: (0,1) to (1,1)\n\n        Now, these two segments: (0,0)-(0,2) and (0,1)-(1,1). They share the point (0,1) but wait, the problem says no three points are collinear. However, note: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) are collinear. But the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line.\" So this example is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoints lying on the segments.\n\n 18. However, wait: the problem says \"no three points are on the same line\", but note that the entire set of points (both bases and spaceships) are distinct and no three are collinear. So in our matching, the four endpoints of two segments are four distinct points and no three of these four are collinear (because the entire set of points has that property). Therefore, the above condition is safe.\n\n 19. But wait: what if the two segments are adjacent? Actually, adjacent in the sense that they share a vertex? We already established that the four endpoints are distinct. So two segments in the matching cannot share an endpoint.\n\n 20. Therefore, we can rely on the condition.\n\n 21. However, note: the matching is defined by two sets: the bases and the spaceships. The bases are distinct from the spaceships, so two segments cannot share a base or a spaceship. Therefore, the four endpoints are distinct.\n\n 22.

But the problem says R>=1, so we don't have to handle 0.\n            for perm in permutations(range(r)):\n                # Build the matching: for base i, we assign spaceship[perm[i]]\n                segments = []\n                for i in range(r):\n                    base_point = bases[i]\n                    ship_point = spaceships[perm[i]]\n                    segments.append( (base_point, ship_point) )\n\n                # Check all pairs of segments\n                valid = True\n                n = len(segments)\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(i+1, n):\n                        if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid:\n                        break\n\n                if valid:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n            print('Yes' if found else 'No')\n\n        Then, define the helper function:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            def orient(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n            o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n            o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n            o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n            # Since no three points are collinear, we don't have to check for zero.\n            return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n 23. But wait: the standard orientation function is often defined with three points (a, b, c) and the cross product (b-a) x (c-a). The above orient function is correct.\n\n 24. However, note: the standard condition for two segments to intersect (given no three collinear) is:\n\n        (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n 25. But wait, there's an alternative: sometimes the segments are considered to be directed. The above function should work.\n\n 26. However, let me test with the example that does not cross:\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n        Segment2: (0,1) to (1,0)\n\n        We already tested and it returns True (they cross). Now, test two segments that don't cross.\n\n        Example: two horizontal segments, but wait, we cannot have three collinear. So let me choose:\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (1,0)\n        Segment2: (0,1) to (1,1)\n\n        These are parallel and do not cross.\n\n        Check:\n\n        o1 = orient((0,0),(1,0),(0,1)) \n            = (1-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(0-0) = 1*1 - 0 = 1\n        o2 = orient((0,0),(1,0),(1,1))\n            = (1-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 1*1 - 0 = 1\n        o1 * o2 = 1 * 1 = 1 -> not negative.\n\n        Then the first condition fails -> returns False. Correct.\n\n        Another example: two segments that do not cross but one is above the other and not aligned.\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (2,0)\n        Segment2: (0,1) to (2,1)\n\n        Similarly, o1 and o2 for segment1 with respect to (0,1) and (2,1) are both positive (same side) so condition fails.\n\n 27. Therefore, the code should be correct.\n\n 28. However, note: the above example of two horizontal segments is allowed because the entire set of points: [(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)] has no three collinear? Actually, (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) are not collinear, (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) are not collinear, etc. So the condition holds.\n\n 29. One more: two segments that are perpendicular but do not cross:\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n        Segment2: (1,1) to (1,3)\n\n        These do not cross.\n\n        Check:\n\n        For segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n        For segment2: (1,1) to (1,3)\n\n        o1 = orient((0,0),(0,2),(1,1)) \n            = (0-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 0*1 - 2*1 = -2\n        o2 = orient((0,0),(0,2),(1,3))\n            = (0-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 2 = -2\n        o1 * o2 = (-2)*(-2)=4 -> positive, so condition fails.\n\n        Then check the other way:\n\n        o3 = orient((1,1),(1,3),(0,0))\n            = (1-1)*(0-1) - (3-1)*(0-1) = 0*(-1) - 2*(-1) = 0 + 2 = 2\n        o4 = orient((1,1),(1,3),(0,2))\n            = (1-1)*(2-1) - (3-1)*(0-1) = 0 - 2*(-1)= 2\n        o3 * o4 = 4 -> positive.\n\n        So returns False. Correct.\n\n 30. Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n 31. But note: the above condition for orientation is the standard one. However, some implementations use a different sign convention. We are consistent.\n\n 32. Let me write the code.\n\n 33. However, note: the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. We are generating all permutations, so we cover all possible matchings.\n\n 34. Edge: when R=0, but the problem says R>=1, so we don't have to.\n\n 35. Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n        This means: \n          R=3, B=3\n          Spaceships: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n          Bases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\n        We must check if there is a matching (permutation) such that the three segments do not intersect.\n\n        One example matching: \n          base0 (-2,1) -> spaceship0 (0,0)\n          base1 (0,3) -> spaceship1 (2,0)\n          base2 (2,2) -> spaceship2 (3,1)\n\n        Let's draw the segments:\n\n          (-2,1) to (0,0)\n          (0,3) to (2,0)\n          (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n        We need to check if any two of these segments intersect.\n\n        Check segment1 and segment2: (-2,1)-(0,0) and (0,3)-(2,0)\n\n        Compute:\n\n        Segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n        Segment2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n        o1 = orient((-2,1),(0,0),(0,3)) \n            = (0 - (-2))*(0-1) - (0-1)*(0 - (-2))\n            = (2)*(-1) - (-1)*(2) = -2 + 2 = 0 -> wait, this is zero? But the problem says no three points are collinear, so this should not happen.\n\n        Wait: the entire set of points is distinct and no three are collinear, but the four points (-2,1), (0,0), (0,3) are not necessarily collinear. However, we got zero for the orientation? That means that (0,3) lies on the line from (-2,1) to (0,0)? \n\n        Let me check: the line from (-2,1) to (0,0): \n            slope = (0-1)/(0-(-2)) = (-1)/2 = -0.5\n            equation: y - 1 = -0.5*(x - (-2)) => y = -0.5*x -1 +1 => y = -0.5*x.\n\n            Check (0,3): 3 = -0.5*0 -> 3=0 -> false.\n\n        Why did we get zero?\n\n        The orient function:\n\n            def orient(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n        For o=(-2,1), a=(0,0), b=(0,3):\n\n            (a[0]-o[0]) = 0 - (-2) = 2\n            (b[1]-o[1]) = 3 - 1 = 2\n            (a[1]-o[1]) = 0 - 1 = -1\n            (b[0]-o[0]) = 0 - (-2) = 2\n\n            = 2 * 2 - (-1) * 2 = 4 - (-2) = 6, not zero.\n\n        I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\n        Correction:\n\n        o1 = orient((-2,1), (0,0), (0,3)) \n            = (0 - (-2)) * (3 - 1) - (0 - 1) * (0 - (-2))\n            = (2) * (2) - (-1) * (2)\n            = 4 - (-2) = 6\n\n        o2 = orient((-2,1), (0,0), (2,0))\n            = (2) * (0-1) - (-1) * (2 - (-2))\n            = 2*(-1) - (-1)*(4) = -2 + 4 = 2\n\n        Then o1*o2 = 6*2=12 (positive) -> condition fails for the first part.\n\n        Then check the other segment:\n\n        o3 = orient((0,3),(2,0),(-2,1))\n            = (2-0)*(1-3) - (0-3)*(-2-0)\n            = 2*(-2) - (-3)*(-2) = -4 - 6 = -10\n        o4 = orient((0,3),(2,0),(0,0))\n            = (2-0)*(0-3) - (0-3)*(0-0)\n            = 2*(-3) - (-3)*(0) = -6\n\n        Then o3*o4 = (-10)*(-6)=60 (positive) -> condition fails.\n\n        So the two segments do not intersect.\n\n        Now, check the other two segments: segment1 and segment3, and segment2 and segment3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the example says output 'Yes', so there must be a matching.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships to see if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If not, output 'No' immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the spaceships and bases from the input.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: For each permutation of the assignment of bases to spaceships, generate the corresponding segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship.\n4. **Checking Segment Intersections**: For each generated set of segments, verify that no two segments intersect. This is done using the orientation method, which checks the relative positions of points to determine if segments intersect.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting segments, output 'Yes'; otherwise, output 'No'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    def orient(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n    \n    o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n    \n    return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print('No')\n        return\n        \n    r = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if r != b:\n        print('No')\n        return\n        \n    idx = 2\n    spaceships = []\n    for i in range(r):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(b):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if r == 0:\n        print('Yes')\n        return\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(r)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(r):\n            base_pt = bases[i]\n            ship_pt = spaceships[perm[i]]\n            segments.append((base_pt, ship_pt))\n            \n        valid = True\n        n = len(segments)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print('Yes' if found else 'No')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input values, including the number of spaceships and bases, followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Validation**: It checks if the number of spaceships and bases are equal. If not, it outputs 'No' because a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: For each possible permutation of base-spaceship assignments, the code constructs segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship.\n4. **Intersection Check**: Using the `segments_intersect` function, which employs the orientation method, the code checks if any two segments intersect. The orientation method calculates the cross product to determine the relative positions of points, ensuring accurate intersection detection.\n5. **Result Determination**: If any permutation results in all segments being non-intersecting, the code outputs 'Yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'No' after checking all permutations.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings to determine the existence of a valid configuration where the connecting segments do not intersect, leveraging combinatorial generation and geometric properties for correctness.",
