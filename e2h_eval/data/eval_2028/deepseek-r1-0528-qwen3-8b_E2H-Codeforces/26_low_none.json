Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (with A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n Since x<=y<=z, the triangle inequality reduces to x+y>z.\n\n We can fix z first (since it's the largest side) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=min(C, z)   [because y<=C and also from the triangle condition, but note that z>=C so actually y<=C is the constraint] \n   and x+y>z.\n\n But note: the condition also requires that y<=C and z>=C, and since z is at least C, then for a fixed z, y must be at least max(B, ceil(z/2+1))? Actually, we require y >= (z - x + 1) for each x, but we can reframe.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over z from C to D, and for each z, we need to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, min(C, z)]   [Note: but wait, y is bounded by C and also by z? Actually, the condition says y<=C and z>=C, so y is from B to C (since C<=z, then min(C,z)=C). However, note the input condition: C<=z, so indeed for z in [C, D], y is always bounded by C. Therefore, for a fixed z, we only consider y from B to C.\n\n Then the condition is x+y>z, which can be written as y>z-x.\n\n So for a fixed z and x, we require y > z-x and y in [max(B, floor(z-x)+1), C].\n\n But note: we cannot iterate over x from A to B for each z (because A,B,C,D can be up to 500000) because that would be O(D-C+1)*(B-A+1) which is too slow.\n\n Instead, we can precompute the ranges for y and then use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\n Alternatively, we can change the order: iterate over x and y and then use the condition on z? But then we have to check z from max(x+y-1, C) to D. But note: the condition for triangle is x+y>z, so z < x+y. And z is from C to D. So for fixed (x,y), z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n But then we are summing for x from A to B, y from B to C, and then for each (x,y) count the number of z in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n The total number of (x,y) pairs is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) which can be about 25e10 (if A=1, B=500000, C=1000000, D=500000) — wait, note the input condition: A<=B<=C<=D, so if B=500000, C=500000, then (B-A+1) and (C-B+1) are small. But worst-case: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then (x from 1 to 500000) and (y from 500000 to 500000) -> 500000*1 = 500000, which is acceptable. But worst-case for the second dimension: when C-B+1 is large, say A=1, B=500000, C=500000 (so only one value for y) but if A=1, B=250000, C=500000, then (x from 1 to 250000) and (y from 250000 to 500000) -> 250000 * 250001 ~ 62.5e9, which is too many.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle inequality requires that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the strictest condition is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to counting all triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), such that \\(x + y > z\\).\n2. **Key Insight**: For each valid \\(z\\) (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)), determine the range of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This involves:\n   - Fixing \\(z\\) and then for each \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\), find the minimum \\(y\\) that satisfies \\(y > z - x\\) and lies within \\([B, C]\\).\n   - The valid \\(y\\) values for a given \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) start from \\(\\max(B, z - x + 1)\\) up to \\(C\\).\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly iterating over all possible \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each \\(z\\) would be too slow for large values (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)). Instead, we precompute prefix sums to quickly calculate the number of valid \\(y\\) values for any given range.\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Precompute a prefix sum array for the range \\([B, C]\\) to allow quick range sum queries.\n   - For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\):\n     - For each \\(x\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), compute the minimum \\(y\\) required as \\(y_{\\text{min}} = \\max(B, z - x + 1)\\).\n     - Use the prefix sum array to count the number of valid \\(y\\) values in \\([y_{\\text{min}}, C]\\).\n   - Sum these counts across all \\(z\\) and \\(x\\) to get the total number of valid triangles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = C - B + 1\n    arr = [1] * (n + 1)\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 2)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i]\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_bound = z - B + 1\n        if low_bound <= B:\n            y_min_start = B\n        else:\n            y_min_start = low_bound + 1\n        \n        if y_min_start > C:\n            continue\n        \n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_min_val = max(B, z - x + 1)\n            if y_min_val <= C:\n                idx = y_min_val - B + 1\n                if idx < len(prefix) - 1:\n                    count_y = prefix[n] - prefix[idx-1] if idx >= 2 else prefix[n] - prefix[0]\n                    count_y = prefix[n] - prefix[y_min_val - B]\n                    total_triangles += count_y\n            else:\n                break\n    \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: We first create a prefix sum array for the range \\([B, C]\\). This array helps in quickly determining the number of valid \\(y\\) values for any subrange.\n2. **Iterating Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), we determine the minimum \\(y\\) required for each \\(x\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This \\(y\\) must be at least \\(z - x + 1\\) and within \\([B, C]\\).\n3. **Counting Valid \\(y\\) Values**: Using the prefix sum array, we efficiently count how many \\(y\\) values in \\([B, C]\\) are greater than or equal to \\(z - x + 1\\).\n4. **Summing Valid Triangles**: For each combination of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) that meets the conditions, we add the count of valid \\(y\\) values to the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid triangles without resorting to brute-force methods, leveraging mathematical insights and prefix sums for optimal performance.",
