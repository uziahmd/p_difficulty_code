    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Idea:\n 1. Sort the array and then consider that the entire array's min is the first element and max is the last in sorted order.\n 2. When we remove an element, the new min would be the smallest element if we don't remove the current min, but if we remove the min then the next smallest becomes the new min.\n 3. Similarly, the new max would be the largest element if we don't remove the current max, but if we remove the max then the next largest becomes the new max.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to remove only one element.\n\n Alternate approach:\n Let the original array be sorted: b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1]\n\n Then the instability without removal is b[n-1] - b[0].\n\n But we are allowed to remove one element. We can consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: Remove an element that is not the current minimum. Then the new min remains b[0] and the new max is either b[n-1] (if we didn't remove the maximum) or if we removed the maximum then the new max is b[n-2].\n However, we can also remove an element that is not the maximum, then the max remains b[n-1] and the min might change only if we remove the minimum? Actually, we have to consider removal of every element and then compute the instability for the resulting array.\n\n But note: the problem size is up to 10^5, so we cannot try removing each element and then compute min and max by scanning (that would be O(n^2)).\n\n Insight:\n\n Consider the sorted array. After removing an element at index i, the new array will have:\n   If i is the first occurrence, then the new min is b[1] (if n>=2) unless we remove the only occurrence of the min, but note there might be duplicates.\n\n Actually, we can break down the removals:\n\n Option 1: Remove an element that is not the global min. Then the min remains b[0].\n Option 2: Remove an element that is not the global max. Then the max remains b[n-1].\n Option 3: Remove an element that is the global min (and possibly the only one) then the min becomes the next distinct value (which is b[1]).\n Option 4: Remove an element that is the global max (and possibly the only one) then the max becomes the next distinct value (which is b[n-2]).\n\n However, note that we might remove an element that is both the min and the max (if the array has only one distinct value). Then both min and max change.\n\n But note: we are removing one element. So the instability after removal is:\n   If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the instability is still b[n-1]-b[0].\n   But wait, actually, if we remove an arbitrary element, the min and max might not change if the element removed was neither the min nor the max.\n\n However, we want to minimize the instability.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n After removal, the array will have a new min and a new max.\n\n The new min will be:\n   b[0] if we do not remove the min (i.e., we remove an element that is >= b[0] and if there is at least one occurrence of b[0] left, then min remains b[0])\n   Otherwise, if we remove all occurrences of b[0], then the new min is the next smallest distinct value which is b[k] where k is the first index such that b[k] > b[0]. But note: we are only removing one element. So if there are multiple b[0] and we remove one, then the min remains b[0]. Only when we remove the last occurrence of b[0] then the min becomes b[1] (if the array has duplicates, then we need to know how many times b[0] appears).\n\n Similarly, the new max will be:\n   b[n-1] if we do not remove the max (i.e., we leave at least one b[n-1])\n   Otherwise, if we remove the last occurrence of b[n-1], then the max becomes b[n-2].\n\n However, note: we are only removing one element. Therefore, if the array has multiple occurrences of the min, then removing one min doesn't necessarily change the min.\n\n Actually, we can consider two types of removals:\n\n 1. Removal of an element that is the global min (but not necessarily the last one) -> then the new min is still the global min if there's another min left, else the next distinct value.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to keep the same count of elements. We are just removing one.\n\n We can reframe the problem:\n\n The instability of the array after removal is: max_remaining - min_remaining.\n\n We can consider the following possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an element from the left part (not necessarily the first) but then the min might change only if we remove the first element? Actually, no: the min is the smallest element. Removing an element that is not the min doesn't change the min.\n\n Actually, the min of the array after removal is:\n   min_remaining = \n        if we remove an element that is the smallest, then we look for the next smallest (which is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to the original min, but note: we might remove one occurrence of the min and there are duplicates so the min remains the same).\n        otherwise, the min remains the same.\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n So let:\n\n   Let the sorted array be b.\n\n   Consider removing the element at position i (0-indexed). Then:\n\n     The new min is:\n        if b[i] == b[0] and the frequency of b[0] is 1, then the new min is b[1]\n        else if b[i] == b[0] and the frequency of b[0] > 1, then the new min is b[0] (because there is still at least one b[0] left)\n\n     Similarly, the new max is:\n        if b[i] == b[-1] and the frequency of b[-1] is 1, then the new max is b[-2]\n        else if b[i] == b[-1] and the frequency of b[-1] > 1, then the new max is b[-1]\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is b[-1]-b[0].\n\n   However, note that we are only removing one element. There are three cases:\n\n   Case A: Remove an element that is the min (and there are multiple mins) -> then min remains the same, max remains the same -> instability = b[-1]-b[0].\n   Case B: Remove an element that is the max (and there are multiple maxes) -> then min remains the same, max remains the same -> instability = b[-1]-b[0].\n   Case C: Remove an element that is the min (and there is only one min) -> then min becomes b[1], max remains the same -> instability = b[-1] - b[1].\n   Case D: Remove an element that is the max (and there is only one max) -> then max becomes b[-2], min remains the same -> instability = b[-2] - b[0].\n   Case E: Remove an element that is the min and also the max (only possible if the entire array is the same) -> then min becomes b[1] and max becomes b[-2] (but if n==2, then after removal the array has one element, so instability=0; if n>2, then the array has at least two distinct values? Actually, if the entire array is the same, then after removing one, the remaining array is all the same, so instability=0. But note: if the array is [5,5,5] then removing one 5, the array becomes [5,5] -> instability 0.\n\n   Actually, if the entire array is the same, then for every removal, the instability is 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the instability after removal is the difference between the maximum of the remaining array and the minimum of the remaining array.\n\n   The remaining array's min and max must lie within the original array's min and max.\n\n   We can consider that the best candidate removals are those that remove an element at the extreme (either min or max). Why? Because if we remove an element in the middle, the min and max don't change, so the instability remains the same. Therefore, to reduce the instability, we must remove an extreme element.\n\n   So we can consider two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: Remove the minimum element (one occurrence). Then the new instability is (max of entire array) - (next minimum if exists, else the next smallest distinct value). But note: if we remove one occurrence of the min, and there are other mins, then the min doesn't change.\n\n   Actually, we can precompute:\n\n     Let left[i] = the minimum value in the subarray from 0 to i-1 (if we remove the element at i, then the min is the min of the rest). But we can use the sorted array.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n     Candidate 1: Remove the first occurrence (the min) -> then the new instability is (max) - (min if there is duplicate min, else the next distinct value). But wait, we don't know the next distinct value.\n\n   Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n     The instability after removal is the maximum value in the array minus the minimum value in the array, but with one element missing.\n\n     We can consider two scenarios:\n\n       Scenario 1: Remove an element that is the min. Then the min becomes the next smallest distinct value (if the min is unique) or remains the same (if there are duplicates). Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove an extreme. But removing a non-extreme element doesn't change the instability. Therefore, the minimal instability must be either:\n\n        Option A: The original instability (if we remove a non-extreme)\n        Option B: The instability when removing the min (if unique) -> then instability = max - (second smallest distinct value) [but note: second smallest distinct value is the next value after the min, which may not be contiguous]\n        Option C: The instability when removing the max (if unique) -> then instability = (second largest distinct value) - min\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? Then we get the instability as (max without the last occurrence of max) - (min without the last occurrence of min). However, if the array has only one distinct value, then after removal, the array still has the same distinct value? No, because if the entire array is the same, then removing one element leaves the same distinct value. Actually, if the entire array is the same, then after removal, the array is still the same, so instability is 0.\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n     If the array is [x, x, x, ...], then removing one x leaves [x, x, ...] -> instability = x - x = 0.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n     Sort the array: b\n\n     Let m = len(b) = n\n\n     Possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the minimum. Then the instability is:\n            If the first k elements are the same (k>=2), then even if we remove one, the min remains the same. Then the instability is b[m-1] - b[0].\n            Else (the min is unique), then the instability is b[m-1] - b[1].\n\n        Possibility 2: Remove an element that is the maximum. Then the instability is:\n            If the last k elements are the same (k>=2), then even if we remove one, the max remains the same. Then the instability is b[m-1] - b[0].\n            Else (the max is unique), then the instability is b[m-2] - b[0].\n\n        Possibility 3: Remove an element that is neither the min nor the max. Then the instability is the same as the original: b[m-1]-b[0].\n\n     However, note: there might be a case where the array has more than two distinct values, and removing an element that is not the min or the max doesn't change the min and max, so the instability remains the same. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum among:\n\n        candidate1 = (if the min is duplicated) then (b[m-1]-b[0]) else (b[m-1]-b[1])\n        candidate2 = (if the max is duplicated) then (b[m-1]-b[0]) else (b[m-2]-b[0])\n        candidate3 = (if we remove an element that is both the min and the max) then 0? Actually, if the array has only one distinct value, then candidate1 and candidate2 become 0 (since then b[m-1]-b[0] is 0, and also if we remove one, the array is still the same distinct value, so 0). But note: if the array has only one distinct value, then the above conditions for candidate1 and candidate2 are triggered because the min and max are the same.\n\n     Actually, we can combine:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = (b[m-1] - (b[1] if b[0] != b[1] else b[0]))   -> but wait, if the min is duplicated, then we don't need to change the min. However, we are removing one occurrence of the min. The min remains the same if there is at least one min left. So the min remains b[0] (because there is at least one left). Then the instability is b[m-1]-b[0]. Similarly, for candidate_remove_max: if the max is duplicated, then the instability is b[m-1]-b[0]; else, it is b[m-2]-b[0].\n\n     But wait, if we remove the min, and the min is duplicated, then the min remains the same, so the instability is the original (b[m-1]-b[0]). Similarly, if we remove the max and it is duplicated, the instability is the original.\n\n     However, what if we remove an element that is both the min and the max? For example, the array [1,1,2] -> removing a 1: then the array becomes [1,2] -> instability 1. Removing 2: then the array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n     But note: in [1,1,2], the min is 1 and the max is 2. The min is duplicated. So according to candidate_remove_min: we get 2-1 = 1. candidate_remove_max: since the max is not duplicated, we get 1-1=0.\n\n     So the minimal instability is 0.\n\n     Therefore, we must consider that sometimes removing the max (which is unique) gives a lower instability than removing the min (which is duplicated) or vice versa.\n\n     We can simply consider:\n\n        candidate1 = b[m-1] - b[0]   # This is the original, and also the result when removing a non-extreme OR when removing a duplicate extreme.\n\n        candidate2 = b[m-1] - b[1]    # This is when we remove the unique min\n        candidate3 = b[m-2] - b[0]    # This is when we remove the unique max\n\n     But wait, what if the array has multiple distinct values? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] \n          candidate1 = 4-1 = 3\n          candidate2 = 4-2 = 2\n          candidate3 = 3-1 = 2\n\n        Then the answer is min(3,2,2) = 2.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,3,4] \n          candidate1 = 4-1 = 3\n          candidate2 = 4-1 = 3   (because the min is duplicated, so removing one min doesn't change the min, so instability remains 3)\n          candidate3 = 3-1 = 2\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,3] \n          candidate1 = 3-1 = 2\n          candidate2 = 3-2 = 1   (because the min 1 is unique)\n          candidate3 = 3-1 = 2   (because the max 3 is duplicated, so removing one 3 leaves the max as 3)\n\n        Then the answer is min(2,1,2)=1.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4,5] \n          candidate1 = 5-1=4\n          candidate2 = 5-2=3\n          candidate3 = 4-1=3\n          answer = 3.\n\n     However, note: in the example [1,2,3,3] we have two possibilities: removing the 1 (unique) gives [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n        removing the 5 (unique) in [1,2,3,4,5] gives [1,2,3,4] -> instability 4-1=3.\n\n     But wait, in [1,2,3,3] we did not consider the possibility of removing a non-extreme? Actually, we don't need to because non-extremes don't change the instability.\n\n     However, what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max? Then the instability remains 5-1=4 (for [1,2,3,4,5]) and 3-1=2 (for [1,2,3,3])? \n\n        [1,2,3,3]: removing 2 (which is not min nor max) -> [1,3,3] -> instability 3-1=2, which is the same as candidate1.\n\n        [1,2,3,4,5]: removing 2 or 3 or 4 -> instability remains 5-1=4.\n\n     So the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n        candidate1 = b[-1]-b[0]   (if we remove an element that is not an extreme, or if we remove a duplicate extreme, then the instability remains candidate1)\n        candidate2 = b[-1]-b[1]   (if we remove the unique min, then the instability becomes this)\n        candidate3 = b[-2]-b[0]   (if we remove the unique max, then the instability becomes this)\n\n     But wait, what if the array is [1,1,2,2]? Then:\n\n        candidate1 = 2-1 = 1\n        candidate2: the min is 1 and duplicated -> so we don't use candidate2? Actually, we should not consider candidate2 if the min is duplicated because then the min doesn't change. Similarly for candidate3.\n\n     How do we know if the min is duplicated? We can check the frequency of the min and max.\n\n     Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = \n            if the first occurrence of the min is at index0 and the last occurrence of the min is at index0 (i.e., the min is unique) then instability = b[-1]-b[1]\n            else (min is not unique) then instability = b[-1]-b[0]\n\n        Similarly, candidate_remove_max = \n            if the last occurrence of the max is at index n-1 and the first occurrence of the max is at index n-1 (i.e., the max is unique) then instability = b[-2]-b[0]\n            else (max is not unique) then instability = b[-1]-b[0]\n\n     But note: the array is sorted, so the min is at the beginning and the max at the end.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Read n\n        Read list a\n        Sort the list: b\n\n        Check the frequency of the first element and the last element.\n\n        Let left = 0, right = n-1.\n\n        Count the frequency of the first element: we can use while loop or use groupby.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # Frequency of min\n            freq_min = 1\n            i = 0\n            while i+1 < n and b[i] == b[i+1]:\n                freq_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n            Similarly for max:\n\n            j = n-1\n            freq_max = 1\n            while j-1 >= 0 and b[j] == b[j-1]:\n                freq_max += 1\n                j -= 1\n\n        Then:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - b[0] if freq_min > 1 else b[-1] - b[1]\n            candidate_remove_max = b[-1] - b[0] if freq_max > 1 else b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        But wait, candidate_remove_min: if the min is duplicated, then removing one occurrence of the min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains the original (b[-1]-b[0]). Similarly for candidate_remove_max.\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum between candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, and the original candidate1 (which is the same as candidate_remove_min or candidate_remove_max when duplicates exist) but note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The best candidate is the minimum of these two.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if we remove an element that is the min (and duplicated) and also the max (and duplicated)? Then we have two candidates that are the original instability, but there might be a better candidate? Actually, we are covering all cases.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2] -> \n            candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1 (because min is duplicated)\n            candidate_remove_max = 2-1 = 1 (because max is duplicated)\n            Then the answer is 1.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] -> \n            candidate_remove_min = 4-2 = 2 (min is unique)\n            candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2 (max is unique)\n            Then the answer is 2.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2] -> \n            candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1 (min duplicated)\n            candidate_remove_max = 1-1 = 0 (max unique)\n            Then the answer is 0.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,3] -> \n            candidate_remove_min = 3-1 = 2 (min 1 is unique -> wait, no: we said candidate_remove_min = b[-1]-b[0] if freq_min>1 else b[-1]-b[1]. Here, the min is 1 and it appears once -> so candidate_remove_min = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2 (because the max 3 appears twice -> so we use the original 3-1=2) -> wait, no: for candidate_remove_max, if the max is duplicated, then we use the original instability (which is 3-1=2). But note: the original instability is 3-1=2, and removing one max (duplicate) leaves the max as 3, so the instability is 3-1=2.\n\n            Then the answer is min(1,2)=1.\n\n        But wait, in [1,2,3,3] the original instability is 2. Removing the min (1) gives [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1. Removing the max (3) gives [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2. So yes, 1 is the minimum.\n\n        However, note: what if we remove the min (1) in [1,2,3,3]? The array becomes [2,3,3] -> the min is 2, the max is 3, so 1.\n\n        But wait, our candidate_remove_min for [1,2,3,3] is 1, and candidate_remove_max is 2.\n\n        Now, what about the possibility of removing an element that is not the min or the max? Then the instability remains 2. But 1 is less than 2, so we don't care.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has only two distinct values? Example: [1,2,2,3] \n            Original instability: 3-1=2.\n            candidate_remove_min: min is 1 (unique) -> so instability = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max: max is 3 (unique) -> so instability = 2-1 = 1.\n            Then the answer is 1.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,2,3] \n            Removing the 1: [2,2,3] -> 3-2=1.\n            Removing the 3: [1,2,2] -> 2-1=1.\n\n        So both give 1.\n\n        What about [1,2,2,3,3]?\n            Original: 3-1=2.\n            candidate_remove_min: min is 1 (unique) -> 3-2=1.\n            candidate_remove_max: max is 3 (duplicated) -> so we use the original 3-1=2.\n\n            Then the answer is 1.\n\n        But wait, if we remove the max (a 3) from [1,2,2,3,3], then the array becomes [1,2,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n        However, we can also remove the min (1) and get [2,2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n\n        So the answer is 1.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n          Step 2: Sort the list.\n          Step 3: Count the frequency of the first element (to see if min is unique) and the last element (to see if max is unique).\n\n          However, note: the frequency of the first element: we can do:\n\n            i = 0\n            while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n                i += 1\n            freq_min = i   # number of consecutive same from the start\n\n          Similarly for the last:\n\n            j = n-1\n            while j >=0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n                j -= 1\n            freq_max = n-1-j\n\n          Then:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - b[0] if freq_min > 1 else b[-1] - b[1]\n            candidate_remove_max = b[-1] - b[0] if freq_max > 1 else b[-2] - b[0]\n\n          But wait, what if the array has only two elements? Then:\n\n            Example: [1,2] \n                sorted: [1,2]\n                freq_min: 1 (so min is unique) -> candidate_remove_min = 2-? but wait, if we remove the min, then the array becomes [2] -> instability 0? But our formula uses b[1] (which is the next element). However, in [1,2] the next element after 1 is 2, so candidate_remove_min = 2-2? That would be 0.\n\n            Actually, for [1,2]:\n                candidate_remove_min = 2 - 2? But wait, the array after removing the min is [2], so the min is 2 and the max is 2, so instability=0.\n\n            Our formula for candidate_remove_min when min is unique: b[-1]-b[1] -> but in [1,2] the second element is 2, so 2-2=0.\n\n            Similarly, candidate_remove_max: since the max is 2 (unique) -> then instability = b[-2]-b[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n            Then the answer is 0.\n\n          But wait, what if the array is [1,2] and we remove the min (1) then the array is [2] -> instability 0.\n          And if we remove the max (2) then the array is [1] -> instability 0.\n\n          However, note: the array has two elements. Removing one element leaves one element, so the instability is 0.\n\n          So the formula works.\n\n        However, consider [1,1,2] again:\n\n            sorted: [1,1,2]\n            freq_min = 2 -> duplicated -> candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1\n            freq_max = 1 -> unique -> candidate_remove_max = 1-1 = 0\n\n        But wait, if we remove the max (2) from [1,1,2], then the array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n        And if we remove a min (one of the 1's) then the array becomes [1,2] -> instability 1.\n\n        So the answer is 0.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          a.sort()\n\n          # Count frequency of the first element (min)\n          freq_min = 1\n          i = 1\n          while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n              freq_min += 1\n              i += 1\n\n          # Count frequency of the last element (max)\n          freq_max = 1\n          j = n-2\n          while j >=0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n              freq_max += 1\n              j -= 1\n\n          # But wait, the above for max: we traverse backwards until we find a different element.\n\n          Then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_min > 1 else a[-1] - a[1]\n          candidate_remove_max = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_max > 1 else a[-2] - a[0]\n\n          print(min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max))\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has only one distinct value? Then a[0]==a[-1]. Then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = a[-1]-a[0] if freq_min>1 else a[-1]-a[1] -> but wait, if the array is all the same, then a[1] is the same as a[0] (if n>=2). But if n==1? but n>=2 per the problem.\n\n          Example: [5,5,5] (n=3)\n            freq_min = 3 (so candidate_remove_min = 5-5=0)\n            freq_max = 3 (so candidate_remove_max = 5-5=0)\n\n          Then min(0,0)=0.\n\n        But wait, if we remove one 5 from [5,5,5] then the array is [5,5] -> instability 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,2,3,4] (all distinct) then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = 4-2 = 2\n          candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2\n          answer = 2.\n\n        But wait, the original instability is 3, and we can remove either 1 or 4 to get 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,2,3,4,5] (distinct) then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = 5-2 = 3\n          candidate_remove_max = 4-1 = 3\n          answer = 3.\n\n        The original is 4, and by removing 1 or 5 we get 3.\n\n        However, is that the minimal? Yes.\n\n        But wait, there is a catch: what if the array has more than two distinct values and the min and max are not adjacent? \n\n        Example: [1,3,4,5,6] (distinct)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: remove 1 -> [3,4,5,6] -> 6-3=3\n          candidate_remove_max: remove 6 -> [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4\n\n          Then the answer would be 3.\n\n        But wait, our formula for candidate_remove_max for distinct array: \n            candidate_remove_max = a[-2] - a[0] = 5-1=4.\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is not the max? Then the instability is the original (6-1=5) which is worse. And if we remove the min, we get 3.\n\n        But wait, is there a way to get a lower instability? \n\n        We are only allowed to remove one element.\n\n        The minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n          candidate_remove_min: 3\n          candidate_remove_max: 4\n\n        So 3.\n\n        However, note: we can also remove an element that is not the min nor the max, but then the instability remains 5 (worse). \n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min and then the instability becomes 3. Or remove the max and becomes 4. \n\n        However, there is no better candidate.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the min nor the max, but the array becomes [1,3,4,5] (if we remove 6) then the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse than 3.\n\n        So the answer is 3.\n\n        However, consider: [1,3,4,5,6] -> the instability after removing 1 is 6-3=3, which is better.\n\n        But wait, is 3 the minimal? Yes.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove 3? Then the array becomes [1,4,5,6] -> instability 6-1=5, worse.\n\n        Remove 4: [1,3,5,6] -> 6-1=5, worse.\n\n        Remove 5: [1,3,4,6] -> 6-1=5, worse.\n\n        Remove 6: [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4, worse.\n\n        So the minimal is 3.\n\n        But wait, our candidate_remove_min is 3, candidate_remove_max is 4, so we take 3.\n\n        The formula works.\n\n        However, wait: in the example [1,3,4,5,6] we assumed the array is distinct. But note: the array is distinct, so the min (1) is unique and the max (6) is unique.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,3,4,5,6,7]? Then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = 7-3 = 4\n          candidate_remove_max = 6-1 = 5\n\n          Then the answer is 4.\n\n        But wait, if we remove 1, the array becomes [3,4,5,6,7] -> 7-3=4.\n        If we remove 7, the array becomes [1,3,4,5,6] -> 6-1=5.\n\n        So indeed the answer is 4.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove 3? Then [1,4,5,6,7] -> 7-1=6, worse.\n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n          Read n and the list a.\n          Sort a.\n          Count the frequency of the first element (min) and the last element (max).\n\n          candidate1 = a[-1] - a[0] if (the first element repeats) else a[-1] - a[1]\n          candidate2 = a[-1] - a[0] if (the last element repeats) else a[-2] - a[0]\n\n          print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\n        However, wait: in the example [1,3,4,5,6] we have:\n\n          a = [1,3,4,5,6]\n          candidate1 = 6-3 = 3   (since min is unique, so we subtract a[1]=3)\n          candidate2 = 6-1 = 5   (since max is unique, so we subtract a[-2]=5? Actually, no: wait, our candidate2 formula was: \n            candidate_remove_max = a[-1]-a[0] if freq_max>1 else a[-2]-a[0]\n\n          In [1,3,4,5,6]: \n            candidate_remove_max = 6-1 = 5? But wait, the formula was: if the max is duplicated then use the original (a[-1]-a[0]), else use a[-2]-a[0]. \n\n          But wait, in the formula above, we defined candidate_remove_max as:\n\n            candidate_remove_max = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_max>1 else a[-2] - a[0]\n\n          For [1,3,4,5,6]: the max is 6 and it appears once, so we use a[-2]-a[0] = 5-1=4.\n\n          Then candidate_remove_max = 4, and candidate_remove_min=3, so the answer is 3.\n\n        But wait, the formula for candidate_remove_min was:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_min>1 else a[-1] - a[1]\n\n          In [1,3,4,5,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the new minimum and maximum after removing any element.\n2. **Count Frequencies**: Check if the first element (minimum) and the last element (maximum) appear more than once in the sorted array. This helps in deciding whether removing these elements will affect the new minimum or maximum.\n3. **Calculate Candidates**:\n   - **Candidate 1**: If the minimum element is duplicated, removing it won't change the minimum, so the instability remains the same as the original array. Otherwise, removing the unique minimum changes the minimum to the next smallest element, and the instability becomes the difference between the original maximum and this new minimum.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Similarly, if the maximum element is duplicated, removing it doesn't change the maximum, keeping the instability the same. Otherwise, removing the unique maximum changes the maximum to the next largest element, and the instability becomes the difference between this new maximum and the original minimum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The answer is the minimum value between the two candidates calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    freq_min = 1\n    i = 1\n    while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n        freq_min += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    freq_max = 1\n    j = n-2\n    while j >= 0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n        freq_max += 1\n        j -= 1\n        \n    candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_min > 1 else a[-1] - a[1]\n    candidate_remove_max = a[-1] - a[0] if freq_max > 1 else a[-2] - a[0]\n    \n    ans = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: The code counts how many times the smallest and largest elements appear in the array. This helps determine if their removal will affect the new minimum or maximum values.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Candidate Remove Min**: If the smallest element appears more than once, removing one instance doesn't change the minimum, so the instability remains `a[-1] - a[0]`. Otherwise, the new minimum becomes `a[1]`, and the instability is `a[-1] - a[1]`.\n   - **Candidate Remove Max**: Similarly, if the largest element appears more than once, the instability stays `a[-1] - a[0]`. Otherwise, the new maximum is `a[-2]`, and the instability is `a[-2] - a[0]`.\n4. **Result**: The minimum value between the two candidates gives the optimal solution, ensuring the least instability after removing one element. This approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting and frequency counting for optimal performance.",
