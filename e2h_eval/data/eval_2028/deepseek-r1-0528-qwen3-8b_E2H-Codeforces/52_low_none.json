Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, we can recycle: every time we have 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle.\n\n How it works:\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We burn all of them, so we get 'a' hours and 'a' old candles.\n   Then, from the 'a' old candles, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we are left with a % b old candles.\n\n   Then we use these new candles (which are actually recycled) and burn them too. Then we get more old candles, which can be combined again.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_new = a\n   Let leftover_old = 0\n\n   While current_new > 0:\n      total_hours += current_new   # because we burn all the current_new candles\n      leftover_old += current_new   # each burned candle becomes one old candle\n      # Now, using the leftover_old, we can make new candles\n      current_new = leftover_old // b\n      leftover_old = leftover_old % b\n\n   But note: we don't need to wait until the very end to use the leftover_old? Actually, we are burning the current_new and then immediately recycling the leftovers.\n\n However, note that in the example: \n   Input: \"4 2\"\n   Step1: current_new=4 -> burn 4 candles, total_hours=4, leftover_old=4\n   Step2: current_new = 4//2 = 2, leftover_old = 4%2 = 0 -> burn 2 candles, total_hours=6, leftover_old=2\n   Step3: current_new = 2//2 = 1, leftover_old = 0 -> burn 1 candle, total_hours=7, leftover_old=1\n   Step4: current_new = 1//2 = 0 -> stop.\n\n   This gives 7, which is correct.\n\n   But wait, after step2 we have 2 old candles, which we use to make 1 new candle (and no leftover). Then we burn that one, and then we have 1 old candle (from that last candle). Then we try to make a new candle from 1 old candle? But 1 < 2, so we cannot. So we stop.\n\n   However, the above code does exactly that.\n\n   But what if we have a=6, b=3?\n   Step1: current_new=6 -> burn 6, total_hours=6, leftover_old=6\n   Step2: current_new = 6//3 = 2, leftover_old = 0 -> burn 2, total_hours=8, leftover_old=2\n   Then current_new = 2//3 = 0 -> stop.\n\n   So output is 8, which matches the sample.\n\n   However, note that in the example input, the second sample is \"6 3\" and the output is 8.\n\n   But wait, let's break down the example \"6 3\":\n      Hours 1-6: burn 6 new candles. Now we have 6 old ones.\n      Then we can make 6//3 = 2 new candles from the 6 old ones. Burn these 2 candles -> that's 2 more hours (total 8). Then we have 2 old ones from the last 2 burned, but 2 < 3, so we stop.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" So we must have at least b old candles to make one new.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n   total = 0\n   current_new = a\n   leftover_old = 0\n\n   while current_new > 0:\n        total += current_new\n        leftover_old += current_new\n        current_new = leftover_old // b\n        leftover_old = leftover_old % b\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But wait, is this efficient? Since a is at most 1000, and b is at least 2, the number of iterations is logarithmic (base b) of a, so very safe.\n\n   However, let me test with a=1, b=2:\n        total=0, current_new=1, leftover_old=0\n        Iteration1: total=1, leftover_old=1; current_new = 1//2 = 0, leftover_old=1%2=1 -> then loop ends. Output 1.\n\n   But according to the problem: \n        We start with 1 candle -> burn for 1 hour, then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle provides one hour of light, and every `b` burnt candles can be recycled into a new candle. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` new candles. Each candle burns for one hour, so initially, we can have `a` hours of light.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all available candles, count the leftover burnt candles. For every `b` burnt candles, recycle them into one new candle.\n3. **Iterative Burning and Recycling**: Repeat the process of burning the newly recycled candles and recycling their burnt remains until there are not enough burnt candles left to form a new candle (i.e., fewer than `b` burnt candles).\n4. **Summing Hours**: Accumulate the total hours from each burning phase until no more candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    current_new = a\n    leftover_old = 0\n\n    while current_new > 0:\n        total_hours += current_new\n        leftover_old += current_new\n        current_new = leftover_old // b\n        leftover_old = leftover_old % b\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `total_hours`, `current_new`, and `leftover_old` are initialized to zero. `current_new` starts with the initial number of candles `a`.\n2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn (`current_new > 0`).\n   - **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, add the number of current candles (`current_new`) to `total_hours` because each candle provides one hour of light.\n   - **Recycling**: Update `leftover_old` by adding the burnt candles from the current burning phase. Then, calculate how many new candles can be made from these leftovers (`current_new = leftover_old // b`) and the remaining leftovers (`leftover_old = leftover_old % b`).\n3. **Termination**: The loop exits when there are not enough leftover burnt candles to form a new candle. The total accumulated hours (`total_hours`) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by iteratively burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of all available resources. The complexity is logarithmic in nature due to the recycling process, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
