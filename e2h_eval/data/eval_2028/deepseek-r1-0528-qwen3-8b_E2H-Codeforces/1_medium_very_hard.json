    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The border of an (a x b) rectangle has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is at least 1x1, then the border is: \n        top and bottom: each row has b cells, but wait: actually for a rectangle of a rows and b columns, the border is:\n        top: b, bottom: b, left and right: (a-2) for each? Actually, no: the entire border is 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that if the rectangle has only 1 cell (a=1, b=1): then the border is 1, but by the formula we get 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> so we must be careful.\n\n Actually, the problem states that the ring has a width of 1 cell. So the ring is the outer layer of the inner rectangle.\n\n How to compute the number of cells in the border of an (a x b) rectangle?\n   It's: \n        if a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n        else: 2*(a + b) - 4   [But wait: if a==1 then the top and bottom would be the same row? Then we have a single row, so we can't use this formula for a=1 or b=1 in the same way.]\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n   total = 0\n   if a >= 1 and b >= 1:\n        if a == 1:\n            total = b   # because it's just one row\n        elif b == 1:\n            total = a\n        else:\n            total = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n However, note that the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is w x h). \n The example: \"3 3 1\" -> 8.\n\n For the 3x3 plate: \n   The outer border: \n        top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 1 (since the top and bottom already covered the corners) and right: 1 -> total 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n But wait: the standard formula for the border of an a x b grid is: 2*a + 2*b - 4 (if a>=2 and b>=2). \n   For a=3, b=3: 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But what if the inner rectangle for the first ring is (w-0) x (h-0)? Actually, the problem says the first ring is the outermost, so we use the original w and h.\n\n However, note: the description says \"the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n So for the first ring (i=1): \n   a1 = w, b1 = h.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the first one should go along the edge\", meaning the entire outer frame. \n\n However, note: the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So the inner rectangle for the second ring would be (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n Therefore, the rings are drawn from the outside inward, and each ring uses the next inner rectangle.\n\n But note: the condition on k: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't try to draw a ring that would have negative dimensions.\n\n However, there is a catch: the formula for the border of an (a x b) rectangle only works when a>=1 and b>=1. And note: the ring i requires that the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)) must have positive area (so at least 1x1). \n\n Steps:\n\n   For ring i (from 1 to k):\n        Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then the number of cells for ring i is:\n            If a_i == 1 and b_i == 1: then 1\n            Else if a_i == 1: then b_i  (because the rectangle is 1 row and b_i columns, so the border is the entire row: b_i cells)\n            Else if b_i == 1: then a_i\n            Else: 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4\n\n   Then we sum the cells for all k rings.\n\n Example: \"3 3 1\"\n   i=1: a1=3, b1=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 8.\n\n Example: \"7 9 1\"\n   i=1: a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n\n Example: \"7 9 2\"\n   i=1: 2*7+2*9-4 = 28\n   i=2: a2=7-4=3, b2=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12\n   Total = 28+12 = 40.\n\n However, wait: the example input \"7 9 2\" gives output 40.\n\n But let me check: the second ring is the border of a 3x5 rectangle. The border of a 3x5 is:\n        top: 5, bottom: 5, left: 3-2=1, right: 3-2=1 -> 5+5+1+1 = 12. Correct.\n\n However, note that the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So we remove 2 cells from each side. The original plate is 7x9.\n\n After removing 2 from each side (left, top, right, bottom) we get 7-4=3 and 9-4=5.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\". That means we are effectively taking the inner rectangle that is 2 cells in from the edge, so we remove 2 from the left and 2 from the right (total 4 from the width) and similarly for the height.\n\n Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\n However, note: the condition on k is such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring must be at least 1x1. Our calculation for the border uses the above conditions.\n\n But note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So we are safe from negative dimensions.\n\n However, we must ensure that we don't get a_i < 1 or b_i < 1. But the condition on k ensures that the last ring's rectangle is at least 1x1.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read the input: one line with three integers.\n\n   Then, for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            # According to the problem, k is chosen so that we don't get negative, but still, if we do, we break.\n            # But the problem says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), so we shouldn't get negative.\n            # So we can assume a>=1 and b>=1 for all i from 1 to k.\n            break\n\n        Then compute the border cells.\n\n   However, the problem condition ensures that we have nonnegative (actually positive) a and b for all i from 1 to k.\n\n   But note: if the plate is 3x3 and k=1: then a=3, b=3 -> okay.\n\n   Another example: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> so k=1.\n\n   For k=1: a=5, b=5 -> border: 2*5+2*5-4 = 20-4=16.\n\n   But wait: the outer border of 5x5 is 5*4 - 4 (the four corners are counted twice) -> 20-4=16, correct.\n\n   However, what if we have a ring that results in a_i=1 and b_i=5? Then we use the condition for a_i==1: then the border is 5.\n\n   Example: w=5, h=5, k=2: \n        Condition: min(w,h)=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1, so k cannot be 2. So we are safe.\n\n   But the problem says: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   Therefore, we don't need to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n   However, let's write the code with the condition to avoid negative, but the problem guarantees k is valid.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # According to the problem, this should not happen, but if it does, we break.\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   But wait: what if one of them is 1 and the other is greater than 1? Then the border is the entire perimeter of that single row/column.\n\n   However, note that the border of a 1xN rectangle is N (if we consider the entire row as the border). Similarly, the border of an Nx1 rectangle is N.\n\n   But note: the problem defines the ring as the border of the inner rectangle. In a 1xN rectangle, the border is the entire rectangle, which is N cells.\n\n   However, we can also note: the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 fails for a=1, b=5: 2*1+2*5-4 = 2+10-4=8, but the actual border is 5. So we must use the condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a unified formula: for any a>=1, b>=1, the border is:\n\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            result = a * b   # but wait: if a=1, then b cells; if b=1, then a cells; if both 1, then 1. However, if a=2 and b=1: then the border is 2, which is 2*2 + 2*1 - 4 = 4+2-4=2 -> that works. Actually, the general formula for the border of a rectangle is: 2*a + 2*b - 4, but only when a>=2 and b>=2. Otherwise, we use the condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_cells = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total_cells += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total_cells += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total_cells += a\n            else:\n                total_cells += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say w, h at least 3, and k at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   However, there's a more efficient way: we can compute without conditionals for the border by:\n\n        border = 0\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            border = 1\n        elif a == 1 or b == 1:\n            border = a * b   # because if either is 1, then the border is the entire rectangle (which is a*b) but wait: if a=1, then the border is b, and if b=1, then the border is a. And if both are 1, then 1. But note: the condition above already handles both 1. So we can do:\n\n        Actually, wait: for a=1 and b=5: the border is 5, which is a*b? no, a*b=5 -> yes. But for a=5 and b=1: 5*1=5 -> yes. And for a=1 and b=1: 1*1=1 -> yes. But wait: for a=2 and b=1: the border should be 2 (the two cells in the row) but a*b=2*1=2 -> yes. For a=2 and b=2: border = 2*2+2*2-4=4+4-4=4, but 2*2=4 -> same. \n\n        Actually, wait: the border of a rectangle is the entire rectangle if at least one of the dimensions is 1. Otherwise, if both dimensions are at least 2, then the border is 2*(a+b)-4.\n\n        But note: the entire rectangle is a*b, but that counts the interior as well. So we cannot use a*b for the border.\n\n        Let me clarify: the border is the outer layer. For a rectangle of a rows and b columns, the border is the set of cells that are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n        The entire rectangle has a*b cells, but the border is not the entire rectangle if there is an interior. The border is:\n\n            First row: b cells\n            Last row: b cells\n            The middle rows: only the first and last column (each row has 2 cells, but the first and last row are already taken) so (a-2)*2.\n\n        Total = b + b + 2*(a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4, provided a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        Now, if a==1: then the rectangle has only one row, so the border is the entire row: b cells.\n        If a==2: then the border is: top row: b, bottom row: b, and no middle rows (since a-2=0) -> 2*b. Also, using the formula 2*a+2*b-4 = 4+2*b-4 = 2*b -> same.\n\n        Similarly, if b==1: then the border is the entire column: a cells. Using the formula: 2*a+2*1-4 = 2*a+2-4 = 2*a-2, which is not a. \n\n        So the formula 2*a+2*b-4 is only valid when a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                border = 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                border = b\n            elif b == 1:\n                border = a\n            else:\n                border = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But wait, what if a==2 and b==1? Then according to the above condition: since b==1, we return a=2. But the border of a 2x1 rectangle is 2 (two cells). Correct.\n\n        Similarly, a==1 and b==2: returns 2. Correct.\n\n        And a==2 and b==2: returns 2*2+2*2-4=4, which is correct (the four cells).\n\n        And a==3 and b=1: returns 3. Correct.\n\n        So we'll use the condition.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the rings are drawn from the outside inward, and the first ring is the outermost. The example inputs are provided.\n\n   Let me test with the example: \"3 3 1\": 2*3+2*3-4=8. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"7 9 1\": 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28. Correct.\n\n   Example: \"7 9 2\": first ring: 28, second ring: a=3, b=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12. Total 40. Correct.\n\n   One more: w=5, h=5, k=1: 2*5+2*5-4=20-4=16. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1. Then the first ring: a=4, b=4 -> 2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n   The outer border of 4x4: \n        top:4, bottom:4, left:2, right:2 -> 4+4+2+2 = 12. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so we don't have to worry about w=4 being too small? Actually, the constraint is w,h>=3, so 4 is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # This should not happen per problem, but break to avoid negative numbers.\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" is provided, and we computed 8. But what if we have w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        i=1: a=3, b=3 -> else branch: 2*3+2*3-4=8. Correct.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: the first ring is the edge. The edge of 3x3 is 8. Correct.\n\n   But note: the example input format is a list of strings in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   Since the problem says the input is one line with three integers, we can read as above.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n   But we are reading one line. So if we run the program, we must provide one line with three integers.\n\n   Let me run with the examples:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> Output: 28\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> Output: 40\n\n   But wait: the example output is:\n\n        ['8', '28', '40']\n\n   So we are printing the integer, and the example output is string representation. But the problem says to print the integer.\n\n   However, the example output is shown as a list of strings. In the competition, they will compare integers.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # We can also do: i from 0 to k-1, then the i-th ring has offset 4*i\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   Wait, in the above loop I used i from 0 to k-1, and the formula subtracts 4*i (which is 4*(i) not 4*(i-1)). \n\n   But note: for the first ring (i=0): \n        a = w - 0 = w, b = h - 0 = h -> correct.\n\n   For the second ring (i=1): \n        a = w-4, b = h-4 -> correct.\n\n   So this is equivalent.\n\n   However, the problem condition says the first ring is the one that goes along the edge (without subtracting 4*(0)), so yes.\n\n   But wait: in the initial description, the i-th ring uses (w - 4*(i-1)) for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1). \n\n   Our loop uses i from 0 to k-1, so the ring index in our loop is (i+1). But the formula for the i-th ring (when i=0) is the first ring, and we subtract 4*i = 0. \n\n   So the formula in the loop is correct.\n\n   However, the problem condition on k: the maximum k is floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: \n        First ring: i=0 -> 7,9 -> 28\n        Second ring: i=1 -> 3,5 -> 12\n\n   But wait, the condition: floor((min(7,9)+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2, so k=2 is allowed.\n\n   But note: the condition says \"at most\", so k=2 is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with k=0? The problem says k>=1, so we don't have to.\n\n   However, the problem says k>=1.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                # We break early if the rectangle becomes invalid.\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: what if the rectangle becomes 0? The condition checks for <1, so 0 is caught. The problem says w,h>=3 and k is bounded, so we won't get negative, but we break if we get 0 or negative.\n\n   However, the problem condition ensures we don't get negative, but we break to be safe.\n\n   But note: the problem condition: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   Example: w=3, h=3, k= floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed. Then we do i=0: a=3, b=3 -> valid.\n\n   Example: w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> allowed. Then i=0: a=4, b=4 -> valid.\n\n   Example: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> allowed.\n\n   Example: w=6, h=6, k= floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1 -> allowed.\n\n   Example: w=7, h=7, k= floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> allowed.\n\n        i=0: a=7, b=7 -> 2*7+2*7-4=28\n        i=1: a=3, b=3 -> 8, total=36.\n\n   But wait: 7x7 plate: \n        First ring: outer border: 2*7+2*7-4=28.\n        Second ring: inner rectangle 3x3, which is 8 cells.\n\n   Total 36.\n\n   Is that correct?\n\n   Let me visualize:\n\n        Original 7x7:\n\n        Ring1: outer border: 28 cells.\n\n        Then we remove 2 from each side: so the inner rectangle is 3x3. The border of 3x3 is 8.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So the second ring is the border of the 3x3 rectangle. \n\n        However, note: the second ring is the one that is 2 cells away from the edge, so it is the next border. The total gilded cells is the union of the two borders.\n\n        The first ring: the outer border. The second ring: the border of the inner 3x3. There is no overlap because the first ring includes the outer layer and the second ring is two layers in. \n\n        So the total is indeed 28+8=36.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ring has a width of 1 cell. The first ring is the outer border (1 cell wide). The second ring is the border of the inner 3x3 (which is 1 cell wide) and that is two cells away from the edge. \n\n   The example outputs are:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   Our code produces:\n\n        \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait: what if the plate is 100x100 and k=25? The problem says k is at most floor((min(100,100)+1)/4)=floor(101/4)=25. So k=25 is the maximum.\n\n        The last ring: i=24 (since we start from 0) -> a=100-4*24=100-96=4, b=100-96=4 -> border=2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n   So the total is the sum for i=0 to 24.\n\n   We can compute it without iterating 25 times? But 25 is small (max k is 25 because min(w,h)>=3, so floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) <= (100+1)//4 = 25). So even if w=h=100, k=25, we iterate 25 times. That's acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, so we don't have to worry about very large w and h (only up to 100). \n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4 * i\n            b = h - 4 * i\n            if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                break\n            if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                total += 1\n            elif a == 1:\n                total += b\n            elif b == 1:\n                total += a\n            else:\n                total += 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n        print(total)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n        i=0: a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4=6+6-4=8 -> prints 8.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n        i=0: a=7, b=9 -> else: 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28 -> prints 28.\n\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n        i=0: 7,9 -> 28\n        i=1: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> else: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total=28+12=40 -> prints 40.\n\n   All correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a case where the rectangle becomes 0? \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k= floor((min(3,3)+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> k=1 is the maximum.\n\n   But if someone gives k=2? The problem says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). However, our code doesn't enforce that. The problem says the input k satisfies that condition.\n\n   But if we get k=2 for w=3, h=3, then:\n\n        i=0: a=3, b=3 -> valid, add 8.\n        i=1: a=3-4= -1 -> invalid, so break. Then total=8.\n\n   However, the problem condition says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)=1, so k=2 should not be given.\n\n   But the problem says the input k satisfies that condition, so we don't have to handle k beyond the condition.\n\n   We break early if we get a dimension less than 1, which is safe.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   Note: the problem says the input k is within the bounds, but breaking early is a good practice.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outer edge of the plate. The solution involves iterating through each ring, calculating the border cells of the corresponding inner rectangle, and summing these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is represented as a grid of `w x h` cells. The first ring is the outermost border of this grid. Each subsequent ring is formed by stepping 2 cells inward from the previous ring. The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle defined by dimensions `(w - 4*i) x (h - 4*i)` for the i-th ring (0-indexed).\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border depends on the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If either dimension is 1, the border is simply the length of the other dimension. Otherwise, the border consists of the top and bottom rows plus the left and right columns, minus the four corners counted twice.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate from 0 to k-1 (for each ring). For each iteration, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If either dimension becomes negative or zero, break the loop early. Otherwise, compute the border cells using the appropriate formula and accumulate the total.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The loop runs at most k times, where k is bounded by the problem constraints (k ≤ floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)). Given the constraints (w, h ≤ 100), the maximum k is 25, making the approach efficient with O(k) time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            break\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            total += 1\n        elif a == 1:\n            total += b\n        elif b == 1:\n            total += a\n        else:\n            total += 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring index `i` from 0 to k-1:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle as `a = w - 4*i` and `b = h - 4*i`.\n   - If either dimension is less than 1, break the loop early since further rings would be invalid.\n   - Compute the border cells:\n     - If both dimensions are 1, the border is 1 cell.\n     - If one dimension is 1, the border is the length of the other dimension.\n     - Otherwise, use the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4` to compute the border cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all valid rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and early termination for invalid cases, ensuring optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
