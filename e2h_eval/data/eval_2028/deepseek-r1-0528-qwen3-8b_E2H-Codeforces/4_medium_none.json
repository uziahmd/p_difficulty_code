The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are counting the red spots (losses) for both players over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2·10^9, we cannot simulate each round.\n\n Instead, we note:\n   - The sequences A and B repeat every m and k moves respectively.\n   - The total rounds is n. We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n Let:\n   - L = the least common multiple of m and k? Actually, we might consider the two cycles together.\n\n However, note: the two sequences are independent and we are going to compare the i-th move of A (cyclically) with the j-th move of B (cyclically).\n\n But note: the rounds are played in order. In round 1: A[0] vs B[0]\n           round 2: A[1] vs B[1]\n           round 3: A[2] vs B[2]\n\n So we are comparing A[i mod m] and B[j mod k] for the i-th and j-th index? Actually, no: the round index t (from 0 to n-1) uses:\n   A_t = A[t % m]\n   B_t = B[t % k]\n\n We need to count for how many t in [0, n-1]:\n   - When does Nikephoros lose? (i.e., when A_t beats B_t? Actually, according to the rules, if the two moves are the same -> draw.\n        Otherwise, if one beats the other, then the one who chose the beating item wins.\n\n        Specifically, the rules are:\n          Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n          Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n          Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n        So for a given round t:\n          If A_t == B_t -> draw (no red spot)\n          Else, if (A_t, B_t) is one of the following: \n            (R, S) -> A_t wins (so Polycarpus loses, i.e., Nikephoros doesn't get a red spot, but Polycarpus does)\n            (S, P) -> A_t wins\n            (P, R) -> A_t wins\n          Then A_t wins.\n\n          Similarly, if (B_t, A_t) is one of the following:\n            (R, S) -> B_t wins (so Nikephoros loses)\n            (S, P) -> B_t wins\n            (P, R) -> B_t wins\n\n        Alternatively, we can say:\n          If A_t wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n          If B_t wins, then Nikephororos gets a red spot.\n\n        And if they are the same, no one gets a red spot.\n\n Therefore, we can define a function that for a given pair (x, y) returns:\n   -1 if x wins against y (then y loses, so if we are looking at (A_t, B_t): then Polycus gets a spot)\n    0 if draw\n    1 if y wins against x (then x loses, so Nikephoros gets a spot)\n\n But actually, we want to count separately for each player.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for one full cycle of both sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different periods.\n\n We can consider the entire game as a grid of indices (t) from 0 to n-1. But n is huge.\n\n Idea: use the fact that the pattern of outcomes repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the outcome at time t depends on t mod m and t mod k.\n\n Let L = LCM(m, k). Then the state (t mod m, t mod k) repeats every L rounds.\n\n However, note: the round index t: \n   A_t = A[t % m]\n   B_t = B[t % k]\n\n The pair (t % m, t % k) has period L = LCM(m, k). So the entire sequence of outcomes (whether draw, A wins, or B wins) repeats every L rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the LCM of m and k: L = (m * k) // GCD(m, k). But note: we are only interested in the first min(n, L) rounds because after that the pattern repeats.\n\n 2. However, n can be very large (up to 2e9) and L might be too large if we compute it naively (but m,k <= 1000, so L <= 1000*1000 which is 1e6, which is acceptable for storing the cycle, but note: we cannot store 2e9 rounds).\n\n But note: we don't need to store all L rounds if we can compute the counts per cycle.\n\n 3. We can break the n rounds into:\n     full_cycles = n // L\n     remainder = n % L\n\n 4. Then, for the full_cycles, we can compute the total red spots for each player by multiplying the counts in one cycle by full_cycles.\n\n 5. Then, for the remainder, we simulate the next 'remainder' rounds.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the LCM might be too large to iterate over? Actually, m and k are at most 1000, so LCM(m,k) is at most 1000*1000 (if they are coprime) which is 1e6, which is acceptable to iterate over.\n\n But wait: what if we do this? We can iterate over one cycle (L rounds) to count:\n   - How many times does Nikephoros get a red spot? (i.e., when B_t wins, meaning (B_t, A_t) is a winning pair for B_t)\n   - How many times does Polycarpus get a red spot? (i.e., when A_t wins, meaning (A_t, B_t) is a winning pair for A_t)\n\n However, note: the outcome for a round t is determined by (A_t, B_t). We can precompute for one cycle (for t from 0 to L-1) the number of wins for A and wins for B.\n\n But note: the outcome of a round is either:\n   - A_t wins: then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n   - B_t wins: then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n   - Draw: no one.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let wins_A = 0   # number of rounds in one cycle where A wins (so Polycarpus loses)\n   Let wins_B = 0   # number of rounds in one cycle where B wins (so Nikephoros loses)\n\n   For t from 0 to L-1:\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n        a = A[i]\n        b = B[j]\n\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            wins_A += 1\n        elif (b, a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            wins_B += 1\n\n   Then, the total for the full cycles:\n        total_nike = full_cycles * wins_B\n        total_poly = full_cycles * wins_A\n\n   Then for the remaining 'r' = n % L rounds, we simulate from t = 0 to r-1 (but note: we have already considered the first L * full_cycles rounds, so we need to simulate the next r rounds, which correspond to t from L*full_cycles to n-1.\n\n   However, note: the state at t is (t mod m, t mod k). We can compute the same way for the next r rounds, but we can also use the same cycle representation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate the next r rounds by iterating from t=0 to r-1, but using the same modulo operations. But note: the cycle is defined by the LCM, so the next r rounds are just the first r rounds of the cycle? Actually, the entire sequence is periodic with period L. So the first r rounds of the cycle (from t=0 to r-1) is the same as the rounds from t = L*full_cycles to n-1.\n\n   So we can simply do:\n\n        for t in range(r):\n            i = (t + L * full_cycles) % m   -> but wait, we don't need to use the absolute t because the modulo operation is periodic. Actually, the outcome at t is determined by (t % m, t % k). But note: (L * full_cycles + t) % m = (t % m) because L is a multiple of m? \n\n        Why? Because L is the LCM of m and k, so L is divisible by m. Therefore, (L * full_cycles) % m = 0, so (L * full_cycles + t) % m = t % m.\n\n        Similarly, (L * full_cycles) % k = 0, so (L * full_cycles + t) % k = t % k.\n\n        Therefore, the outcome of the round at position (L * full_cycles + t) is the same as the outcome at position t.\n\n        So we can simply use the first r rounds (t from 0 to r-1) to count the additional wins.\n\n        But wait: we already computed the entire cycle of length L, and we are breaking the game into full_cycles cycles and then the first r rounds of the next cycle.\n\n        However, we can also compute the additional wins by:\n\n            additional_nike = 0\n            additional_poly = 0\n            for t in range(r):\n                i = t % m\n                j = t % k\n                a = A[i]\n                b = B[j]\n\n                if a == b:\n                    continue\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    additional_poly += 1\n                elif (b, a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    additional_nike += 1\n\n        Then total_nike = full_cycles * wins_B + additional_nike\n        total_poly = full_cycles * wins_A + additional_poly\n\n 6. But note: the above simulation for the full cycle and the remainder is O(L + r). Since L can be up to 1000000 (if m and k are 1000 and coprime, then L=1000000) and r is at most L-1 (which is about 1000000) then worst-case we are doing about 2000000 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n However, note: the input constraints say that m, k are at least 1 and at most 1000, so LCM(m,k) can be as large as 1000*1000 = 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: there's a catch. What if n is 0? Then we don't need to do anything. Also, if n is very small, then we don't even enter the full_cycles loop.\n\n 7. Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n   Step 2: Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n   Step 3: Compute L = LCM(m, k). We can compute GCD first.\n\n   How to compute GCD?\n        import math\n        gcd = math.gcd(m, k)\n        L = (m * k) // gcd\n\n   Step 4: Precompute the full cycle (one cycle of length L) and count wins_A and wins_B.\n\n        wins_A_cycle = 0\n        wins_B_cycle = 0\n\n        for t in range(L):\n            i = t % m\n            j = t % k\n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if a_char beats b_char\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_A_cycle += 1\n            elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_B_cycle += 1\n\n   Step 5: Compute full_cycles = n // L\n            remainder = n % L\n\n   Step 6: Count the remainder part (first remainder rounds of the cycle) similarly.\n\n        wins_A_rem = 0\n        wins_B_rem = 0\n\n        for t in range(remainder):\n            i = t % m\n            j = t % k\n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_A_rem += 1\n            elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_B_rem += 1\n\n   Step 7: Total for Nikephoros (the one who uses A) gets red spots when B wins, i.e., wins_B_cycle and wins_B_rem.\n            Total_Nike = full_cycles * wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem\n\n        Total for Polycarpus (the one who uses B) gets red spots when A wins, i.e., wins_A_cycle and wins_A_rem.\n            Total_Poly = full_cycles * wins_A_cycle + wins_A_rem\n\n   Step 8: Print Total_Nike and Total_Poly.\n\n 8. However, wait: let me check the example.\n\n Example input: \n      7\n      RPS\n      RSPP\n\n  Here, n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n  m=3, k=4 -> LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n  But wait: we are going to break 7 rounds into 0 full cycles (since 7//12=0) and remainder=7.\n\n  Then we simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\n  Round 0: t=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n  Round 1: t=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> (P, S): P beats S? Yes, so wins_A_cycle +=1 (Polycarpus loses). \n  Round 2: t=2 -> A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> (S, P): S beats P? Yes, so wins_A_cycle +=1 (Polycarpus loses again).\n  Round 3: t=3 -> A[3%3]=A[0]='R', B[3%4]=B[3]='P' -> (R, P): R vs P -> P beats R? (because P beats R) so wins_B_cycle +=1 (Nikephoros loses).\n  Round 4: t=4 -> A[4%3]=A[1]='P', B[4%4]=B[0]='R' -> (P, R): P beats R -> wins_A_cycle +=1 (Polycarpus loses).\n  Round 5: t=5 -> A[5%3]=A[2]='S', B[5%4]=B[1]='S' -> draw.\n  Round 6: t=6 -> A[6%3]=A[0]='R', B[6%4]=B[2]='P' -> (R, P): P beats R -> wins_B_cycle +=1 (Nikephoros loses).\n  Round 7: t=7 -> not included because we only go to 6 (remainder=7, so we do t=0 to 6).\n\n  So in the first 7 rounds (remainder part) we have:\n        wins_A_rem = 3 (from rounds 1,2,4) -> Polycarpus loses 3 times.\n        wins_B_rem = 2 (from rounds 3,6) -> Nikephoros loses 2 times.\n\n  Then the output would be: Nikephoros: 2, Polycarpus: 3.\n\n  But the example output is \"3 2\".\n\n  Wait, the problem says: \n        \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n  So according to the example, the counts are:\n        Nikephoros (using A) has 3 red spots -> meaning he lost 3 times (so his losses are counted as wins_B)\n        Polycarpus (using B) has 2 red spots -> meaning he lost 2 times (so his losses are counted as wins_A)\n\n  In our code, we have:\n        Total_Nike = wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem = 2 (from above) -> correct for Polycarpus's red spots? No, wait.\n\n  Actually, note: \n        - When A wins (wins_A_cycle): that means Polycarpus loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n        - When B wins (wins_B_cycle): that means Nikephoros loses -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n  Therefore, we have:\n        Nikephoros's red spots = wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem = 2 (from example remainder) + 0 (full cycles) = 2, but expected is 3.\n\n  And Polycarpus's red spots = wins_A_cycle + wins_A_rem = 3 + 0 = 3, but expected is 2.\n\n  This is the opposite.\n\n  Correction:\n\n        In the example, the rounds:\n\n          Round 0: draw -> no one\n          Round 1: (P, S) -> A wins (so Polycarpus loses) -> Polycarpus: 1\n          Round 2: (S, P) -> A wins -> Polycarpus: 2\n          Round 3: (R, P) -> B wins (because P beats R) -> Nikephoros: 1\n          Round 4: (P, R) -> A wins -> Polycarpus: 3\n          Round 5: draw\n          Round 6: (R, P) -> B wins -> Nikephoros: 2\n\n        So indeed, Polycarpus has 3 red spots and Nikephoros has 2. But the example says:\n\n          \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n        There is a discrepancy.\n\n  Let me re-read the example:\n\n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Output: \n          3 2\n\n        Explanation:\n\n          Round 1: R - R -> Draw.\n          Round 2: P - S -> Nikephoros loses. (So that's one red spot for Nikephoros)\n          Round 3: S - P -> Polycarpus loses.\n          Round 4: R - P -> Nikephoros loses.\n          Round 5: P - R -> Polycarpus loses.\n          Round 6: S - S -> Draw.\n          Round 7: R - P -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So:\n          Nikephoros loses in rounds 2,4,7 -> 3 times.\n          Polycarpus loses in rounds 3,5 -> 2 times.\n\n        Now, what are the moves?\n\n          Round 1: t=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw. Correct.\n          Round 2: t=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> (P, S): According to the rules, P beats S? Actually, no: \n                  Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n                  Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n                  Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n          So (P, S): Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors beats Paper. Therefore, S wins. But note: the example says \"Nikephoros loses\", meaning the one who used the sequence A (Nikephoros) loses.\n\n          In round 2: \n            A_t = 'P', B_t = 'S'\n            Who wins? \n              P vs S: S beats P -> so the winner is the one who played S? \n            But wait: the rule is: \n              - Rock beats Scissors\n              - Scissors beats Paper\n              - Paper beats Rock\n\n            So when comparing A_t (P) and B_t (S): \n                P vs S: S beats P -> so B_t wins. Therefore, B wins, meaning Nikephoros loses.\n\n          Round 3: t=2 -> A[2]='S', B[2]='P'\n            S vs P: S beats P? Yes, because Scissors beats Paper. So A wins (because A is showing S and B is showing P). Therefore, Polycarpus (who is using B) loses.\n\n          Round 4: t=3 -> A[3%3]=A[0]='R', B[3]='P'\n            R vs P: P beats R -> so B wins -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n          Round 5: t=4 -> A[4%3]=A[1]='P', B[4%4]=B[0]='R'\n            P vs R: P beats R -> so A wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n\n          Round 6: t=5 -> A[5%3]=A[2]='S', B[5%4]=B[1]='S' -> draw.\n\n          Round 7: t=6 -> A[6%3]=A[0]='R', B[6%4]=B[2]='P'\n            R vs P: P beats R -> so B wins -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So the outcomes:\n\n          Round 2: B wins -> Nikephoros loses (count for Nikephoros +=1)\n          Round 3: A wins -> Polycarpus loses (count for Polycarpus +=1)\n          Round 4: B wins -> Nikephoros loses (count for Nikephoros +=1)\n          Round 5: A wins -> Polycarpus loses (count for Polycarpus +=1)\n          Round 7: B wins -> Nikephoros loses (count for Nikephoros +=1)\n\n        Therefore, in the remainder (7 rounds) we have:\n          wins_B_rem = 3 (rounds 2,4,7) -> these are the losses for Nikephoros.\n          wins_A_rem = 2 (rounds 3,5) -> these are the losses for Polycarpus.\n\n        Then our code should assign:\n          Total_Nike = full_cycles * wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem\n          Total_Poly = full_cycles * wins_A_cycle + wins_A_rem\n\n        But wait, in our code we defined:\n          wins_A_cycle: the count of rounds where A wins (so Polycarpus loses) -> which we added to wins_A_cycle for the cycle.\n          wins_B_cycle: the count of rounds where B wins (so Nikephoros loses) -> which we added to wins_B_cycle for the cycle.\n\n        So in the example, we computed wins_B_rem=3 and wins_A_rem=2.\n\n        Therefore, we must output:\n          Nikephoros: wins_B_cycle (from full cycles) + wins_B_rem (from remainder) = 3\n          Polycarpus: wins_A_cycle (from full cycles) + wins_A_rem (from remainder) = 2\n\n        But wait, in the example we broke the 7 rounds (which is less than LCM(3,4)=12) so full_cycles=0, then:\n          Total_Nike = 0 + 3 = 3\n          Total_Poly = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n        That matches.\n\n        However, in the code above we did:\n\n          if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              wins_A_cycle += 1   # meaning A wins\n          elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              wins_B_cycle += 1   # meaning B wins\n\n        This is correct because:\n\n          Condition for A wins: \n            (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then A wins (so Polycarpus loses)\n\n          Condition for B wins: \n            (b_char, a_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then B wins (so Nikephoros loses)\n\n        But note: the condition for B wins can be rewritten by swapping: \n            (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] \n          is equivalent to:\n            (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] \n\n        However, we don't need to change the code because we are checking separately.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a draw? Then we skip.\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n 9. Therefore, the code is:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A_str)\n        k = len(B_str)\n\n        # Compute LCM of m and k\n        gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n        L = (m * k) // gcd_val\n\n        # Precompute one full cycle (length L) for both players' wins\n        wins_A_cycle = 0   # A wins -> Polycarpus loses\n        wins_B_cycle = 0   # B wins -> Nikephoros loses\n\n        for t in range(L):\n            i = t % m\n            j = t % k\n            a_char = A_str[i]\n            b_char = B_str[j]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if a_char beats b_char\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_A_cycle += 1\n            else:\n                # Then check if b_char beats a_char\n                if (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    wins_B_cycle += 1\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        # Now, we need to count the remainder part (first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle)\n        wins_A_rem = 0\n        wins_B_rem = 0\n\n        for t in range(remainder):\n            i = t % m\n            j = t % k\n            a_char = A_str[i]\n            b_char = B_str[j]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_A_rem += 1\n            else:\n                if (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    wins_B_rem += 1\n\n        nike_red = full_cycles * wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem\n        poly_red = full_cycles * wins_A_cycle + wins_A_rem\n\n        print(f\"{nike_red} {poly_red}\")\n\n 10. But wait: the example provided in the problem also has a second sample:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          RRRRRRRR\n          R\n\n        Output: \n          0 0\n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n          n=5, A_str=\"RRRRRRRR\", B_str=\"R\"\n\n          m=8, k=1 -> LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n          We break n=5 into full_cycles=0, remainder=5.\n\n          We simulate 5 rounds:\n\n            t=0: (R,R) -> draw.\n            t=1: (R,R) -> draw.\n            t=2: (R,R) -> draw.\n            t=3: (R,R) -> draw.\n            t=4: (R,R) -> draw.\n\n          So wins_A_rem=0, wins_B_rem=0.\n\n          Therefore, output \"0 0\" -> correct.\n\n 11. Another example from the problem: the first sample output is \"3 2\", which we already matched.\n\n 12. However, note: the condition for B wins in the example was written as an 'else' but we can also do without else.\n\n  But wait: what if the pair is not a win for A and not a win for B? It must be one of them because the moves are either same or one beats the other. However, we have two conditions: \n        Condition1: (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then A wins.\n        Condition2: (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then B wins.\n\n  And if neither holds, then it's a draw? Actually, the only possibilities are draw or one of the two wins.\n\n  But note: the set of pairs that are not draws and not A wins must be the ones that are B wins. However, we can also check by:\n\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            A wins\n        elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            B wins\n        else:\n            draw\n\n  But note: the condition for B wins is the same as (b_char, a_char) being a winning pair for the first element? \n\n  However, we can also note that the set of winning pairs is fixed. \n\n  But wait: what about (R, R)? We skip by the first condition (a_char==b_char). Similarly, (S, S) and (P, P) are skipped.\n\n  Now, consider a non-draw and non-A win: for example, (R, P). \n        Condition1: (R, P) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> false.\n        Condition2: (P, R) -> check: ('P','R') is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, because ('P','R') is the third tuple.\n\n        So (R, P) is caught by the else if.\n\n  Similarly, (S, R): \n        Condition1: ('S','R') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n        Condition2: ('R','S') -> which is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so B wins.\n\n  But wait: (S, R): \n        According to the rules: \n          Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n          So in (S, R): the first is Scissors and the second is Rock -> Scissors vs Rock: Rock beats Scissors -> so the second wins, so B wins.\n\n  And (R, S): \n        Condition1: (R, S) is in the list -> A wins. Correct because Rock beats Scissors.\n\n  So the conditions are correctly defined.\n\n  However, note: we can also write the condition for B wins as:\n\n        if (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] \n\n  But note: the set [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] is symmetric in the sense that if (x,y) is a win for x, then (y,x) is a loss for x (which is a win for y). \n\n  But our condition for B wins is exactly that.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  Let me test with a small cycle: m=1, k=1: \n        A_str=\"R\", B_str=\"S\"\n\n        n=1: \n          t=0: (R,S) -> A wins? Condition1: (R,S) in [('R','S'), ...] -> yes, so wins_A_cycle=1, wins_B_cycle=0.\n\n        Then for n=1: \n          full_cycles = 1 // LCM(1,1)=1 -> 1\n          remainder=0\n\n          Total_Nike = 1 * wins_B_cycle (which is 0) + 0 = 0\n          Total_Poly = 1 * wins_A_cycle (which is 1) + 0 = 1\n\n        Output: \"0 1\"\n\n        But wait: the round: A wins -> Polycarpus loses. So Polycarpus has 1 red spot, Nikephoros has 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n  Another test: m=1, k=1: A_str=\"R\", B_str=\"P\"\n        n=1: \n          t=0: (R,P) -> Condition1: (R,P) not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no.\n                 Condition2: (P,R) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so wins_B_cycle=1.\n\n        Then: \n          Total_Nike = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1\n          Total_Poly = 1 * 0 + 0 = 0\n\n        Correct: (R,P) -> P beats R, so B wins -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n 13. Code:\n\n        We'll use math.gcd.\n\n        Note: if m or k is 0? The problem states m,k>=1.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n 14. However, note: the LCM computation: (m*k)//gcd(m,k) is safe because m and k are positive integers.\n\n 15. Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Output: 3 2 -> correct.\n\n  Example 2:\n        Input:\n          5\n          RRRRRRRR\n          R\n\n        Output: 0 0 -> correct.\n\n  Example 3: \n        Input: \n          1\n          R\n          S\n\n        Output: 0 1 -> correct.\n\n  Example 4:\n        Input:\n          1\n          R\n          P\n\n        Output: 1 0 -> correct.\n\n  Example 5: \n        Input:\n          1\n          S\n          P\n\n        Condition: (S, P) -> Condition1: (S, P) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, because ('S','P') is in the list. So A wins -> Polycarpus loses -> output for Polycarpus is 1, Nikephoros 0.\n\n        Output: 0 1 -> correct.\n\n  Example 6: \n        Input:\n          1\n          P\n          S\n\n        Condition: (P, S) -> Condition1: (P, S) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no, because the list has ('P','R') but not ('P','S').\n                   Condition2: (S, P) -> (S, P) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so B wins -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Output: 1 0 -> correct.\n\n 16. We are good.\n\n However, note: the condition for A wins is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] and for B wins is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] but applied to (b_char, a_char). \n\n 17. Final code with math import.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints say that n can be up to 2000000000, and we are iterating up to L (which is at most 1000000) and then remainder (at most 1000000) so total iterations up to 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, if we want to optimize further, we can precompute the entire cycle without iterating each round by having a double loop for the two sequences? \n\n  But since m and k are at most 1000, we could do:\n\n        total_wins_A = 0\n        total_wins_B = 0\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(k):\n                # Each pair (A[i], B[j]) will appear once per cycle? Not exactly: the cycle length is LCM(m,k) and the pair (i,j) appears floor(L/(m*k)) * (m*k) / (m*k) ? \n\n        Actually, the number of times a particular (i,j) appears in L rounds is: \n            Since the cycle is LCM(m,k) = (m*k)//g, and the period for i is m and for j is k, then the pair (i,j) appears exactly g times? \n\n        But note: the rounds t from 0 to L-1: \n            t mod m = i and t mod k = j.\n\n        The solutions for t are the numbers in the arithmetic progression: \n            t ≡ i (mod m)\n            t ≡ j (mod k)\n\n        By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since m and k are not necessarily copr",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The players use predefined sequences of moves that repeat cyclically. Given the potentially large number of rounds (up to 2·10^9), a direct simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to efficiently compute the results.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of rock, paper, or scissors. Each round's outcome depends on the current move in each player's sequence. The challenge is to count the total losses (red spots) over `n` rounds without processing each round individually due to the large constraint on `n`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined sequence repeats every `LCM(m, k)` rounds. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of length `LCM(m, k)` and then handling the remaining rounds separately.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Compute LCM**: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Analysis**: For each round in one full cycle, determine if Nikephoros or Polycarpus loses. Count these losses (red spots) for the cycle.\n   - **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total losses are computed by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes up to `LCM(m, k)` rounds, which is at most 1,000,000 for sequences of length 1000. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // gcd_val\n\n    wins_A_cycle = 0\n    wins_B_cycle = 0\n\n    for t in range(L):\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n        a_char = A_str[i]\n        b_char = B_str[j]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            wins_A_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            if (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_B_cycle += 1\n                \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    wins_A_rem = 0\n    wins_B_rem = 0\n    \n    for t in range(remainder):\n        i = t % m\n        j = t % k\n        a_char = A_str[i]\n        b_char = B_str[j]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            wins_A_rem += 1\n        else:\n            if (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                wins_B_rem += 1\n                \n    nike_red = full_cycles * wins_B_cycle + wins_B_rem\n    poly_red = full_cycles * wins_A_cycle + wins_A_rem\n\n    print(f\"{nike_red} {poly_red}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the cycle length `L`.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round in one full cycle (`L` rounds), the code checks if the current moves result in a loss for either player. The counts of such losses (`wins_A_cycle` for Polycarpus losing and `wins_B_cycle` for Nikephoros losing) are recorded.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total losses are calculated by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`n // L`) and adding the losses from the remaining rounds (`n % L`).\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance.",
