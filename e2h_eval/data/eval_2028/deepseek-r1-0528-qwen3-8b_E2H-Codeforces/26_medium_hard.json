    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three variables with ranges. The total number of triples is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1) which can be very large (up to about 500000^3) so we cannot iterate.\n\n We need to count the triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, but note that x and y have fixed ranges.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For a fixed z (which must be at least C and at most D), the condition is x+y>z.\n\n Now, x is from [A, B] and y is from [B, C] (note: but note the condition on y: it must be >=B and <=C, but also note that in the input we have B<=C, so that's fine).\n\n So for fixed z, we require x+y>z.\n\n We can precompute two arrays or use prefix sums to count the pairs (x,y) for different z? But note that z runs from C to D, and for each z we are counting pairs (x,y) from two intervals.\n\n Alternatively, we can change the order: Instead of iterating over z, we can consider the entire set of pairs (x,y) and then for each pair (x,y) count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. Then sum over all pairs.\n\n However, the range of x+y: minimum is A+B, maximum is B+C. And we require z < x+y, and z>=C and z<=D.\n\n But note: we have two independent variables and the triple must satisfy the given ranges.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Count the total number of triples without the triangle condition: \n        total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n 2. Subtract the degenerate cases? But actually we want to count only the non-degenerate ones, and the condition is x+y>z.\n\n But wait, there might be an easier way: \n\n We can count the pairs (x,y) and for each pair, count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y.\n\n However, note: the condition for a non-degenerate triangle is x+y>z, so z must be strictly less than x+y. Also, we require that the sides form a triangle, which is equivalent to the three conditions, but because x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z is the only one that matters.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Let F(z) = the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\n   Then the answer = Sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z)\n\n But note: we can also do:\n\n   Let T = {(x,y) | A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C}\n\n   Then for a fixed z, we want to count the pairs (x,y) in T such that x+y>z.\n\n   Since T is defined by two independent intervals, we can precompute an array for the possible x+y values.\n\n   However, the range of x+y is from A+B to B+C. The maximum value is B+C (when x=B, y=C) and the minimum is A+B (when x=A, y=B). \n\n   We can use two pointers or sorting and binary search if we fix one variable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can fix x and then y must be in [max(B, z-x+1), C] (but note: we require y>=B and y<=C, and also y>=ceil(z-x+1)? Actually, y must be at least max(B, z-x+1) but wait: the condition is x+y>z -> y>z-x. Since y is integer, y>=floor(z-x)+1.\n\n   But note: we can also use inclusion-exclusion: total pairs minus the pairs with x+y<=z.\n\n   So for fixed z, let:\n        total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n        bad_pairs = pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n   Then F(z) = total_pairs - bad_pairs.\n\n   Then we can compute:\n\n        ans = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            bad_pairs = 0\n            for x from A to B:\n                # For a fixed x, y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)] (because x+y<=z => y<=z-x, and y>=B, and y<=C)\n                low_y = B\n                high_y = min(C, z-x)\n                if low_y <= high_y:\n                    bad_pairs += (high_y - low_y + 1)\n            F(z) = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - bad_pairs\n\n        Then ans += F(z) for each z.\n\n   But wait: the range of z is from C to D (at most 500000) and x from A to B (at most 500000) so the total operations would be (D-C+1)*(B-A+1) which is about 500000*500000 = 25e10, too slow.\n\n   We need a better way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We can precompute the bad_pairs for each z by considering the pairs (x,y) and then using a two-dimensional prefix sum? Or by changing the order.\n\n   Note: bad_pairs for a fixed z is the number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z.\n\n   We can think of the set of pairs (x,y) as a rectangle in the grid. The condition x+y<=z defines a half-plane.\n\n   We can use a two-pointer method or a cumulative sum for the diagonal.\n\n   Let's fix x and then the condition on y is y <= min(C, z-x) and y>=B.\n\n   Then bad_pairs(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1)   [if min(C, z-x) >= B]\n\n   We can rewrite: for each x, the condition on y is y in [B, min(C, z-x)]. So the length of y for a fixed x is: L(x, z) = max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1)\n\n   Then bad_pairs(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} L(x, z)\n\n   Now, note that z runs from C to D (about 500000 distinct z) and x runs from A to B (about 500000 distinct x) again leading to 250e9 operations.\n\n   We need to invert the summation: instead of iterating over x for each z, we can iterate over x and then update the contributions for all z.\n\n   Notice that for a fixed x, the condition for y is fixed, and the condition for z is that z must be at least x+B (because y>=B, so x+y>=x+B) and at most x+C (because y<=C, so x+y<=x+C). But note, our z is from C to D.\n\n   However, the condition for bad_pairs is x+y<=z, so for fixed x and y, the condition is z>=x+y. But wait, we are counting bad_pairs for a fixed z: all pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute an array F for the entire grid of (x,y) and then do a 2D prefix sum, but note the grid is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) which is about 500000*500000, which is 250e9 elements, too big.\n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the pairs (x,y) form a rectangle, and the condition x+y<=z is a linear constraint. We can use the concept of \"diagonals\".\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let M = B-A+1, N = C-B+1.\n\n   Then the set of pairs (x,y) is a grid from x=A to x=B, y=B to y=C.\n\n   We want to count the number of points (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n   This is equivalent to: for each z, we want to count the points below the line x+y=z.\n\n   We can use a two-variable function and then use cumulative sums over the diagonals.\n\n   However, note: the grid is not too large in the sense that the range of x+y is from A+B to B+C, which is about 1e6 (if A,B,C,D up to 500000, then A+B can be 1e6, and B+C can be 1e6, so the range of x+y is about 1e6). \n\n   We can precompute an array for the frequency of each s = x+y for s in [min_sum, max_sum] (min_sum = A+B, max_sum = B+C).\n\n   Then for a fixed z, the bad_pairs is the sum_{s = min_sum}^{min(max_sum, z)} freq[s].\n\n   How to compute freq[s] for s from A+B to B+C?\n\n   We can iterate over x from A to B, and for each x, y from B to min(C, s-x) doesn't help directly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use two nested loops but that is O(M*N) which is too slow.\n\n   Another way: use the two pointers and a difference array.\n\n   Let s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\n   We can iterate over x from A to B, and then the y values for a fixed x run from B to C. Then the s values for this x are from x+B to x+C.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let arr = [0]*(s_max+2)   # s_max = B+C, which is up to 1000000 (since A,B,C,D up to 500000, so B+C<=1000000)\n\n        For x from A to B:\n            # The smallest s for this x is x+B, largest is x+C.\n            # The counts for s from x+B to x+C: each s appears once for each x? Actually, for each x and each y in [B, C] we have one pair (x,y) and one s=x+y.\n\n            # But note: multiple pairs (x,y) can have the same s.\n\n            # Actually, we are just counting the pairs, so we can do:\n\n            # For x, we have (C-B+1) pairs, and they contribute to s from x+B to x+C.\n\n            # But we can use a sweep: we can mark the start and end of s values for x.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use two pointers and a Fenwick tree, but note that the range of s is 10^6, which is acceptable for a difference array.\n\n        Steps for the frequency array:\n\n            Let diff = [0]*(s_max+2)\n            For x from A to B:\n                low_s = x+B\n                high_s = x+C\n                # Then for s from low_s to high_s, we add 1 for each s? But wait, the pairs (x,y) for fixed x: y runs from B to C, so s runs from x+B to x+C, and each s is hit exactly once per x? Actually, no: for fixed x, as y increases by 1, s increases by 1. So for x, the s values are consecutive from x+B to x+C.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    diff[low_s] += 1\n                    diff[high_s+1] -= 1\n\n            Then we do a prefix sum on diff to get freq[s] for s from s_min to s_max.\n\n        Then, we can precompute a prefix array for the freq array:\n\n            prefix[i] = freq[0] + freq[1] + ... + freq[i]\n\n        Then for a fixed z, the bad_pairs(z) = prefix[min(s_max, z)] - prefix[s_min-1]   [but note: we built the frequency for s from s_min to s_max, and we don't care about s outside]\n\n        Actually, we should build the frequency array only for s from s_min to s_max.\n\n        But note: the condition for bad_pairs is x+y<=z, so we need the sum of freq[s] for s from s_min to min(s_max, z).\n\n        Then F(z) = total_pairs - bad_pairs(z) = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - (prefix[min(s_max, z)] - prefix[s_min-1])\n\n        But wait: our prefix array is built from index 0 to s_max, but we are only concerned with s_min to s_max. We can define:\n\n            Let s_min_val = A+B\n            Let s_max_val = B+C\n\n            Build an array `freq` for indices from s_min_val to s_max_val.\n\n            Actually, we can use a difference array for the entire range [0, s_max_val] (with s_max_val = B+C, which is <= 1000000) and then take the prefix.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the frequency array for s from 0 to s_max_val (we can set s_max_val = B+C).\n\n            Step 2: Use a difference array `diff` of zeros of size (s_max_val+2).\n\n            Step 3: For x from A to B:\n                s_low = x+B\n                s_high = x+C\n                diff[s_low] += 1\n                diff[s_high+1] -= 1\n\n            Step 4: Build the freq array for s from 0 to s_max_val by doing:\n\n                freq[0] = 0\n                for i from 1 to s_max_val:\n                    freq[i] = freq[i-1] + diff[i]\n\n            Then build a prefix array P for the frequency from s_min_val to s_max_val? Actually, we can do:\n\n                P[i] = P[i-1] + freq[i]   for i from 0 to s_max_val.\n\n            Then for a fixed z (from C to D):\n\n                If z < s_min_val: then bad_pairs(z)=0.\n                Else if z >= s_max_val: then bad_pairs(z) = total_pairs (because every pair (x,y) has s<=s_max_val<=z).\n                Else: bad_pairs(z) = P[z] - P[s_min_val-1]   but wait, we built P from 0 to s_max_val.\n\n            Actually, we built P from 0 to s_max_val, and the pairs (x,y) only contribute to s from s_min_val to s_max_val.\n\n            However, note: we built the frequency for s from 0 to s_max_val, but the pairs (x,y) only appear in the range [s_min_val, s_max_val]. So for s < s_min_val, freq[s]=0.\n\n            Then bad_pairs(z) = P[z]   [because we want the sum of freq[s] for s from 0 to z, but note: we only care about s from s_min_val to min(z, s_max_val). However, our P[z] includes s from 0 to z, but the pairs only exist from s_min_val to s_max_val. But we set the diff for s_min_val and above, so for s < s_min_val, freq[s]=0.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Let total_pairs = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n                Let s_min_val = A+B\n                Let s_max_val = B+C\n\n                Build an array `freq` for s from 0 to s_max_val (index 0 to s_max_val) by:\n\n                    diff = [0]*(s_max_val+2)\n                    for x from A to B:\n                        s_low = x+B\n                        s_high = x+C\n                        if s_high >= s_min_val:\n                            # But note: s_low might be less than s_min_val? Actually, x>=A, so s_low = x+B >= A+B = s_min_val. Similarly, s_high = x+C <= B+C = s_max_val.\n                            # So we can safely do:\n\n                            diff[s_low] += 1\n                            if s_high+1 <= s_max_val:\n                                diff[s_high+1] -= 1\n                    # Then build freq from diff.\n\n                Then build P[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i} freq[j] for i from 0 to s_max_val.\n\n                Then for each z from C to D:\n\n                    if z < s_min_val:\n                        bad_pairs = 0\n                    elif z >= s_max_val:\n                        bad_pairs = total_pairs\n                    else:\n                        bad_pairs = P[z]   # because P[z] = freq[0]+...+freq[z] and for s< s_min_val, freq[s]=0, so effectively it's the sum from s_min_val to min(z, s_max_val) but note: we built the entire array from 0 to s_max_val, and we did not skip s_min_val.\n\n                Then F(z) = total_pairs - bad_pairs\n\n                Then ans += F(z)\n\n            However, wait: the condition for bad_pairs is x+y<=z, which is s<=z. And we counted the pairs (x,y) by their s=x+y. So yes, bad_pairs(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n            But note: our frequency array counts the pairs (x,y) by the value of s=x+y, so the sum of freq[s] for s from 0 to z is indeed the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n        Then the answer is the sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z) = sum_{z=C}^{D} [total_pairs - bad_pairs(z)]\n\n        However, note: total_pairs is constant for all z, so:\n\n            ans = (D-C+1)*total_pairs - sum_{z=C}^{D} bad_pairs(z)\n\n        But wait: is that correct? Because we are counting for each z the number of pairs (x,y) that form a triangle with that z? Actually, no: the condition is that the triangle must have sides (x,y,z) with x,y,z in the given ranges and the triangle condition x+y>z. And we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z. Then we sum over z.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            ans = sum_{z=C}^{D} [number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z]\n\n            = sum_{z=C}^{D} [total_pairs - bad_pairs(z)]\n\n            = (D-C+1)*total_pairs - sum_{z=C}^{D} bad_pairs(z)\n\n        But note: total_pairs is the total number of pairs (x,y) (which is independent of z). However, we must ensure that the same pair (x,y) can be used for multiple z. And indeed, we are counting the same (x,y) for different z.\n\n        This is correct because for a fixed (x,y) and a fixed z, the condition is independent.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the entire set of z to be considered independently? Actually, we are iterating over z from C to D, and for each z we count the pairs (x,y) that work with that z.\n\n        But note: the pairs (x,y) are fixed and independent of z. So we can also compute:\n\n            ans = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} [number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y]\n\n        And that is equivalent.\n\n        Now, let's compare:\n\n            Method 1: Iterate over z from C to D, for each z compute bad_pairs(z) (using the precomputed frequency array for s) and then subtract from total_pairs.\n\n            Then ans = (D-C+1)*total_pairs - sum_{z=C}^{D} bad_pairs(z)\n\n        But note: the range of z is [C, D] and the bad_pairs(z) is the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n        However, we can also compute the second term by:\n\n            sum_{z=C}^{D} bad_pairs(z) = sum_{z=C}^{D} (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z)\n\n            = sum_{s=s_min_val}^{min(s_max_val, D)} [freq[s] * (number of z in [C, D] such that z>=s and z>=C) ]\n\n            Actually, for a fixed s, the condition is that z must be >= s and also in [C, D]. But wait: bad_pairs(z) counts the pairs (x,y) with s=x+y<=z. Then we are summing over z from C to D.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the order: \n\n            = sum_{s=s_min_val}^{min(s_max_val, D)} freq[s] * max(0, (D - max(s, C) + 1))\n\n            Why? For a fixed s, the condition for z is: z>=s and z>=C and z<=D. So z must be in [max(s, C), D]. Then the number of z is max(0, D - max(s, C) + 1).\n\n            Then:\n\n                bad_pairs_total = 0\n                for s from s_min_val to min(s_max_val, D):\n                    count_z = max(0, D - max(s, C) + 1)\n                    bad_pairs_total += freq[s] * count_z\n\n            Then ans = (D-C+1)*total_pairs - bad_pairs_total\n\n        But wait, which method is easier? The first method requires building the frequency array for s (which is O(B-A) and then iterating over z from C to D (which is O(D-C)), which is acceptable because D-C can be up to 500000.\n\n        However, note that the frequency array for s is built from s_min_val to s_max_val (which is about 10^6) and the iteration over z is 500000, so both are acceptable.\n\n        But the second method (by s) requires iterating over s from s_min_val to s_max_val (about 10^6) and then for each s we do a simple computation.\n\n        Actually, we already built the frequency array for s, so the second method is also easy.\n\n        However, note: we have two ways to compute the same thing. We can choose the first method (iterating over z) because we have the frequency array and then we can use the prefix array to quickly get bad_pairs(z) for each z.\n\n        Steps for the first method:\n\n            Step 1: Read A, B, C, D.\n\n            Step 2: total_pairs = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n            Step 3: s_min_val = A+B, s_max_val = B+C.\n\n            Step 4: Build a diff array for the frequency of s (from 0 to s_max_val) for the pairs (x,y).\n\n            Step 5: Build the freq array and then the prefix array P (for the cumulative sum of freq from 0 to s_max_val).\n\n            Step 6: Initialize ans = 0.\n\n            Step 7: For z from C to D:\n                if z < s_min_val:\n                    bad_pairs_z = 0\n                elif z >= s_max_val:\n                    bad_pairs_z = total_pairs\n                else:\n                    bad_pairs_z = P[z]   # because P[z] = sum_{s=0}^{z} freq[s] and for s < s_min_val, freq[s]=0, so it's the same as the sum from s_min_val to min(z, s_max_val) but note: our P[z] includes all s from 0 to z.\n\n                Then F(z) = total_pairs - bad_pairs_z\n\n                ans += F(z)\n\n            Step 8: Print ans.\n\n        But wait: is this correct? \n\n            Example: Input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n            Then A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n            total_pairs = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1) = 2*2 = 4.\n\n            s_min_val = 1+2 = 3, s_max_val = 2+3 = 5.\n\n            Build diff array for s from 0 to 5.\n\n            x from 1 to 2:\n\n                x=1: s from 1+2=3 to 1+3=4 -> diff[3] +=1, diff[5] -=1 (because 4+1=5)\n                x=2: s from 2+2=4 to 2+3=5 -> diff[4] +=1, diff[6] -=1 (but 6 is beyond 5, so we do nothing for the second part if s_high+1>s_max_val)\n\n            Then build freq for s from 0 to 5:\n\n                s=0:0, s=1:0, s=2:0, s=3:1, s=4:1 (from x=1) then from x=2: s=4 gets another 1, so s=4 becomes 2, then s=5: from x=2 we subtract at s=6 which is out of bounds, so s=5: from x=1 we subtracted at s=5? Actually, we did:\n\n                diff[3]=1, diff[5]=-1, diff[4]=1, and then for s=5: we have diff[5]=-1, and then we build:\n\n                s0:0\n                s1:0\n                s2:0\n                s3:1\n                s4:1+1=2\n                s5:2-1=1   (from the diff: at s=5 we have -1 from the first x, and no other additions, so at s=5: freq[5] = freq[4] + diff[5] = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\n                Then the pairs (x,y) are:\n\n                    (1,2): s=3\n                    (1,3): s=4\n                    (2,2): s=4\n                    (2,3): s=5\n\n                So the frequencies: s=3:1, s=4:2, s=5:1.\n\n            Now, for z from 3 to 4 (since C=3, D=4):\n\n                z=3: \n                    bad_pairs_z = P[3] = freq[0]+freq[1]+freq[2]+freq[3] = 0+0+0+1 = 1.\n                    Then F(3)=4-1=3.\n\n                z=4:\n                    bad_pairs_z = P[4] = 1 (from s=3) + 2 (from s=4) = 3.\n                    Then F(4)=4-3=1.\n\n                Total ans = 3+1 = 4.\n\n            The example says 4. So that matches.\n\n            However, note: the example lists the triangles: (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). \n\n            But wait, according to our calculation, for z=3: we require x+y>3. The pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>3 are:\n\n                (1,3): 1+3=4>3 -> valid for z=3, but wait: the triangle condition is x+y>z, so for z=3, we require x+y>3. Then the pairs (1,2):1+2=3 is not valid, (1,3):4>3 valid, (2,2):4>3 valid, (2,3):5>3 valid -> so 3 pairs for z=3.\n\n                Then for z=4: we require x+y>4. \n                    (1,2):3<=4 -> invalid\n                    (1,3):4<=4 -> invalid (non-degenerate requires strictly greater, so 4 is not allowed for z=4)\n                    (2,2):4<=4 -> invalid\n                    (2,3):5>4 -> valid.\n\n                So only 1 pair for z=4.\n\n            Therefore, the total is 3+1=4.\n\n            But note: the example output is 4.\n\n            However, note the problem: the sides must satisfy A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            In the example, for z=3: the side z must be at least C=3, so z=3 is allowed. But then why is (1,3,3) valid? The condition is x+y>z: 1+3>3 -> 4>3, yes.\n\n            Also, (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3, yes.\n\n            (2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3, yes.\n\n            (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4, yes.\n\n            But wait, in our calculation for z=3, we counted the pairs (x,y) that have x+y>3, and then we assigned that for z=3, the triangle is (x,y,3) and for z=4, the triangle is (x,y,4). \n\n            However, note: the problem does not require that the same (x,y) cannot be used with different z. And indeed, we are counting each (x,y,z) triple.\n\n            But note: the problem states: the sides must satisfy A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            So the side y must be between B and C, and z between C and D. \n\n            In the example, for (1,3,3): y=3 (which is between B=2 and C=3) and z=3 (between C=3 and D=4). Similarly, (2,2,3): y=2 (which is between 2 and 3) and z=3. (2,3,3): y=3, z=3. (2,3,4): y=3, z=4.\n\n            So our calculation is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" (second example) gives 3.\n\n            A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n            Conditions: x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (so y=2), z in [2,5].\n\n            total_pairs = (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)=2*1=2.\n\n            s_min_val = 1+2=3, s_max_val=2+2=4.\n\n            Build diff array for s from 0 to 4.\n\n            x=1: s from 3 to 3 (because y=2, so s=1+2=3) -> diff[3]+=1, diff[4]-=1.\n            x=2: s from 4 to 4 -> diff[4]+=1, diff[5]-=1 (but 5>4, so we don't do the subtraction for the upper bound beyond 4).\n\n            Then freq:\n                s0:0, s1:0, s2:0, s3:1, s4: (from x=1: diff[4] becomes -1, then from x=2: diff[4] becomes 0) -> so s4:1.\n\n            Then for z from 2 to 5 (C=2, D=5):\n\n                But note: our bad_pairs(z) counts pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n                However, note: our pairs (x,y) are (1,2) and (2,2). \n\n                For z=2: \n                    Condition: x+y<=2. \n                    The smallest s is 3, so bad_pairs(2)=0. Then F(2)=2-0=2.\n\n                For z=3: \n                    bad_pairs(3)=P[3]=freq[0]+...+freq[3]=0+0+0+1=1 -> F(3)=2-1=1.\n\n                For z=4:\n                    bad_pairs(4)=P[4]=1 (from s=3) + 1 (from s=4) = 2 -> F(4)=0.\n\n                For z=5:\n                    bad_pairs(5)=P[4] (since our s_max_val=4) = 2 -> F(5)=0.\n\n                Then total ans = 2+1+0+0 = 3.\n\n            The example says 3.\n\n            However, let's list the triangles:\n\n                (x,y,z) must satisfy: 1<=x<=2, 2<=y<=2, 2<=z<=5.\n\n                Condition: x+y>z.\n\n                (1,2,z): 1+2=3>z -> z must be <3, so z=2 (only) -> (1,2,2): valid.\n                (2,2,z): 2+2=4>z -> z must be <4, so z=2,3 -> (2,2,2) and (2,2,3).\n\n                So the triangles are (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3) -> 3 triangles.\n\n            But note: in the problem statement, the condition is: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            For (1,2,2): we have x=1, y=2, z=2. But note: the condition requires y>=B (which is 2) and y<=C (which is 2) -> ok, and z>=C (which is 2) -> ok. But the condition also requires C<=z, and C=2, so z>=2. However, note the condition: the entire condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. \n\n            In the condition: we have B<=y<=C and C<=z. Here, y=2 and C=2, so y<=C is 2<=2, and then z>=C=2. But the condition requires y<=C and then z>=C. So the triangle (1,2,2) is valid because y=2<=C=2 and z=2>=C=2.\n\n            However, note: the condition is written as: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n            This implies that we have: x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. And the condition for the triangle is x+y>z.\n\n            So (1,2,2) is valid.\n\n            But wait: the problem statement says: \"In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides (1,2,2), (2,2,2) and (2,2,3)\".\n\n            So our code works.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" gives 1.\n\n            A=B=C=D=500000.\n\n            total_pairs = (500000-500000+1)*(500000-500000+1)=1.\n\n            s_min_val = 500000+500000=1000000, s_max_val=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n            Build diff: for x=500000, y from 500000 to 500000, so s=1000000.\n\n            Then for z from 500000 to 500000:\n\n                if z < s_min_val? 500000 < 1000000 -> bad_pairs_z=0 for z=500000? \n\n                Then F(500000)=1-0=1.\n\n            But wait: the triangle condition: 500000+500000>500000 -> 1000000>500000, true.\n\n            However, note: we must check if the condition holds: the side z must be at least C (500000) and at most D (500000). So z=5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we must efficiently compute this without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition that needs to be checked for non-degeneracy is \\(x + y > z\\). The other conditions (\\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\)) are automatically satisfied if \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: We can leverage the ranges provided for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to efficiently count valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\). The total number of possible triples without the triangle condition is \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\). However, we need to subtract those triples that do not satisfy \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), count how many pairs \\((x, y)\\) produce that sum. This is done using a difference array technique to mark the start and end of ranges for each \\(x\\).\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array from the frequency array to quickly compute the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\) for any given \\(z\\).\n   - **Iterate Over Valid \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), use the prefix sum array to determine the number of invalid pairs (where \\(x + y \\leq z\\)) and subtract this from the total pairs to get the count of valid pairs for that \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles the constraints by processing the sums \\(x + y\\) in linear time relative to the range of possible sums (up to \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 10^5\\)), making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n    s_min_val = A + B\n    s_max_val = B + C\n    \n    if n_pairs == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    diff = [0] * (s_max_val + 2)\n    \n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        low_s = x + B\n        high_s = x + C\n        diff[low_s] += 1\n        if high_s + 1 <= s_max_val:\n            diff[high_s + 1] -= 1\n            \n    freq = [0] * (s_max_val + 1)\n    current = 0\n    for s in range(s_max_val + 1):\n        current += diff[s]\n        freq[s] = current\n        \n    P = [0] * (s_max_val + 1)\n    P[0] = freq[0]\n    for i in range(1, s_max_val + 1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + freq[i]\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        if z_val < s_min_val:\n            bad_pairs_z = 0\n        elif z_val >= s_max_val:\n            bad_pairs_z = n_pairs\n        else:\n            bad_pairs_z = P[z_val]\n        ans += (n_pairs - bad_pairs_z)\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If there are no possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) (i.e., \\(B < A\\) or \\(C < B\\)), the answer is immediately 0.\n3. **Difference Array Setup**: For each \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), compute the range of sums \\(x + y\\) where \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\). Use a difference array to mark these ranges efficiently.\n4. **Frequency and Prefix Arrays**: Convert the difference array into a frequency array representing how many pairs \\((x, y)\\) produce each possible sum \\(s\\). Then, construct a prefix sum array to quickly compute cumulative frequencies up to any sum \\(s\\).\n5. **Counting Valid Triples**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), determine the number of invalid pairs (where \\(x + y \\leq z\\)) using the prefix sum array. Subtract this from the total pairs to get the count of valid triples for each \\(z\\).\n6. **Output the Result**: Sum the valid triples for all \\(z\\) and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to manageable computations by leveraging mathematical insights and array techniques, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
