He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with at least one string s of length n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n How can we approach?\n\n Observation:\n Since the string s has length n, we can consider that the prefixes and suffixes must overlap in a consistent way.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: ['5', 'ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'] \n   Actually, wait: the example input is given as a string that we split? Let's look:\n\n Example input format:\n   First line: '5'\n   Then 8 lines: 'ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'\n\n But wait, the example output is 'SPPSPSPS'. That means the first string 'ba' is assigned 'S', the next two 'a' (two of them) are assigned 'P'? Actually, let's break down:\n\n However, note: the example input has two strings of length 1: two 'a's. And two strings of length 2: 'ab' and 'ba'. Similarly, for length 3: two 'aba'? Actually, let's list by length:\n\n Length 1: two strings: 'a', 'a'\n Length 2: two strings: 'ab', 'ba'\n Length 3: two strings: 'aba', 'aba'? Wait, but the example input has two 'aba'? Actually, the example input provided as:\n\n   ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\n But wait, there are 9 tokens if split by '\\n'? Actually, the example input is given as a multi-line string.\n\n Let me re-read the example input:\n\n   Input: \n      5\n      ba\n      a\n      abab\n      a\n      aba\n      baba\n      ab\n      aba\n\n So the two strings of length 1: ['a','a']\n        length 2: ['ba','ab']   (but wait, the third string is 'abab' which is length 4, then 'a' (length1 again?), actually:\n\n Let me count the lengths:\n\n   n=5, so we have lengths from 1 to 4.\n\n   Strings:\n     0: 'ba' -> len=2\n     1: 'a'  -> len=1\n     2: 'abab' -> len=4\n     3: 'a' -> len=1\n     4: 'aba' -> len=3\n     5: 'baba' -> len=4\n     6: 'ab' -> len=2\n     7: 'aba' -> len=3\n\n So we have:\n   length1: ['a','a'] -> two\n   length2: ['ba','ab'] -> two\n   length3: ['aba','aba'] -> two\n   length4: ['abab','baba'] -> two\n\n Now, we have to assign each string as either P or S.\n\n Conditions:\n   For length 1: one prefix and one suffix.\n   For length 2: one prefix and one suffix.\n   etc.\n\n But note: the entire string s must be of length 5. What is the full string?\n\n The only string that matches is \"ababa\" (as the example says). \n\n How do we assign?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the strings by their length.\n\n 2. We know that for each length L (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings: one is a prefix of s and one is a suffix of s.\n\n 3. But we don't know which is which. However, we can use the following idea:\n\n    Consider the condition that the full string s must have a prefix of length L and a suffix of length L, and they must be compatible with the entire string.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require us to recover the full string, only to assign labels 'P' or 'S' to each input string.\n\n    But the assignment must be consistent. How?\n\n    Note: the set of prefixes and suffixes must form a string s of length n.\n\n    Let the full string s = s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}\n\n    Then, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n\n    Now, consider two consecutive conditions: for example, for L and L+1.\n\n    We must have that the prefix of length L+1 starts with the prefix of length L.\n\n    Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 ends with the suffix of length L.\n\n    But note: we are also given the set of all prefixes and suffixes. However, the problem says that the given set is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of some string s.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We know the entire set of prefixes and suffixes. We can try to reconstruct the string s.\n\n    However, note: the problem says that there might be multiple answers, but we just need one.\n\n    Another observation:\n\n    The problem guarantees that there is at least one string s of length n that has the given set as its proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\n    How about we try to determine the full string?\n\n    Steps:\n\n    Let s be the unknown string of length n.\n\n    We know all the proper prefixes and suffixes. In particular, we know the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1, and similarly for others.\n\n    But note: we don't know which is which.\n\n    However, we can use the following:\n\n    Consider the two strings of length 1. One must be the first character (prefix) and the other the last character (suffix).\n\n    Similarly, for length 2: one is the first two characters and one is the last two.\n\n    But note: the last two characters must end with the last character (which we know from length1). Similarly, the first two must start with the first character.\n\n    Therefore, we can:\n\n    Step 1: Group the 2n-2 strings by length.\n\n    Step 2: For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two candidate strings.\n\n    Step 3: We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n    But how? We can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent.\n\n    Let's denote:\n\n        Let P_L be the prefix of length L, and S_L be the suffix of length L.\n\n    Then, the full string s must satisfy:\n\n        s[0:L] = P_L\n        s[n-L:n] = S_L\n\n    Also, for two consecutive lengths L and L+1:\n\n        P_{L+1} must be equal to P_L + (some char) [the next char]\n        S_{L+1} must be equal to (some char) + S_L\n\n    But we don't know which of the two in a group is P and which is S.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try to reconstruct the entire string by aligning the prefixes and suffixes.\n\n    However, note: the problem constraints (n<=100) and the total number of strings is 2n-2 (which is at most 198) is too high for exponential algorithms.\n\n    Insight:\n\n    Consider the two strings of length 1. Let them be a and b.\n\n    Then, the first character of s must be one of them, say a, and the last character must be the other, say b.\n\n    Now, consider the two strings of length 2. Let them be c and d.\n\n    The prefix of length 2 must start with a, so it must be a + x (where x is the second character). Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with b, so it must be y + b.\n\n    But wait, we don't know the second character. However, from the prefix of length 2, we know that the second character is the last character of the prefix of length 2.\n\n    Similarly, from the suffix of length 2, the second last character is the first character of the suffix of length 2.\n\n    Now, also note: the entire string of length n must have the prefix of length 2 and the suffix of length 2.\n\n    Moreover, the prefix of length 3 must start with the prefix of length 2, and the suffix of length 3 must end with the suffix of length 2.\n\n    We can try to determine the entire string by using the following:\n\n        Let s0 = first character (one of the length1)\n        Let s_{n-1} = last character (the other of the length1)\n\n        Then, the prefix of length L must be s0...s_{L-1}. Similarly, the suffix of length L must be s_{n-L}...s_{n-1}.\n\n    But we don't know the entire string. However, we can use the two strings of each length to choose the correct one.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, then the 2n-2 strings.\n\n    Step 2: Group the strings by length.\n\n    Step 3: We'll assign the two strings of length 1: one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        How to decide? We can use the consistency with longer strings.\n\n        But note: we don't know the entire string. However, we can use the following:\n\n        For the two strings of length 1, we have two possibilities: \n            Possibility 1: s0 = a, s_{n-1} = b.\n            Possibility 2: s0 = b, s_{n-1} = a.\n\n        Then, for the two strings of length 2, we have two candidates: one must start with s0 and the other must end with s_{n-1}. But wait, if we fix s0 and s_{n-1}, then the prefix of length2 must start with s0, and the suffix of length2 must end with s_{n-1}.\n\n        However, we have two strings of length2. They must be assigned: one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        Condition for prefix of length2: must start with s0.\n        Condition for suffix of length2: must end with s_{n-1}.\n\n        So, if we fix s0 and s_{n-1}, then we can check:\n\n            Let the two length2 strings be A and B.\n\n            Then, the prefix must be the one that starts with s0, and the suffix must be the one that ends with s_{n-1}. But note: what if both conditions are satisfied by the same string? That would be impossible because then we cannot assign the other string.\n\n        Therefore, we must have that one string starts with s0 and the other ends with s_{n-1}. \n\n        But wait, what if a string starts with s0 and also ends with s_{n-1}? Then we have two choices? Actually, no: we have two distinct strings. However, the problem does not say they are distinct. But note the guarantee: the set of prefixes and suffixes of a string s. It is possible that a prefix and a suffix are the same string? Then we have two copies of that string. But the input has exactly two strings for each length, and they can be the same?\n\n        Example: n=3, string \"aaa\". Then the proper prefixes are \"a\" and \"aa\", and the proper suffixes are \"a\" and \"aa\". So the two length1: two \"a\"s, and two length2: two \"aa\"s.\n\n        So, we must account for duplicates.\n\n        Approach:\n\n        We can try both possibilities for length1? But n is at most 100, and we have 2n-2=198 strings, and n-1=99 groups. Trying both possibilities for the first group (length1) would lead to 2^(n-1) possibilities, which is too many.\n\n    Alternative Insight:\n\n    Notice: the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes of a string s must be closed under taking the prefix property and suffix property. \n\n    However, we can use the following:\n\n        We know that the entire string s must be the unique string that has the given set of proper prefixes and suffixes. But note: the problem allows multiple answers (any consistent one) and the set is guaranteed to be from some string.\n\n    Another idea:\n\n        Consider the two strings of length 1. Without loss of generality, let the two be a and b.\n\n        Then, the two strings of length 2: one must be a + c (for the prefix) and one must be d + b (for the suffix). But note: the prefix of length2 must be the two-character string starting with a, and the suffix must be the two-character string ending with b.\n\n        Now, what if we look at the two strings of length (n-1)? \n\n        The prefix of length n-1 must be s[0:n-1], and the suffix of length n-1 must be s[1:n]. \n\n        But note: the prefix of length n-1 must end with the last character of the prefix of length 2? Not necessarily.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n        We have two strings of length L. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix. The entire string s must be built from the prefix and the suffix. \n\n        Specifically, for a fixed L, if we assign a string X as the prefix of length L, then the next character (if we were to extend the prefix to L+1) must be the first character of the prefix of length L+1. Similarly, the previous character (if we were to extend the suffix to L+1) must be the last character of the suffix of length L+1.\n\n        But wait, we don't know the entire string. However, we can use the fact that the two strings of length L and the two strings of length L+1 must be related.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n        Let P_L be the chosen prefix of length L, and S_L be the chosen suffix of length L.\n\n        Then, the prefix of length L+1 must be P_L + c (for some char c). Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 must be d + S_L (for some char d).\n\n        But note: the entire string s must have the same middle part? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the two strings of length 1 and then the two strings of length n-1:\n\n          The prefix of length n-1 must be the entire string without the last character. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 must be the entire string without the first character.\n\n        Then, we can write:\n\n          s = P_{n-1} + last_char   (and last_char is the suffix of length1)\n          s = first_char + S_{n-1}\n\n        But note: the two strings of length n-1: one is the prefix and one is the suffix.\n\n        How do they relate?\n\n          P_{n-1} = s[0:n-1] and S_{n-1} = s[1:n]\n\n        Then, s[0] is known (from the length1) and s[n-1] is known (from the length1). Also, the two strings of length n-1 must be:\n\n          P_{n-1} = s0 + ... + s_{n-2}\n          S_{n-1} = s1 + ... + s_{n-1}\n\n        Then, we have:\n\n          s0 = known (from length1)\n          s_{n-1} = known (from length1)\n\n        And the two strings of length n-1 must be:\n\n          Candidate1: P_{n-1} = s0 + ... + s_{n-2}\n          Candidate2: S_{n-1} = s1 + ... + s_{n-1}\n\n        Then, the entire string s is:\n\n          s0 + ... + s_{n-2} + s_{n-1}   [from P_{n-1} and the known s_{n-1}] but wait, the last character is already known and must be s_{n-1}. However, the prefix of length n-1 does not include the last character.\n\n        Actually, we can reconstruct s from the two length n-1 strings?\n\n        But note: we don't know which is which. However, we know:\n\n          The prefix of length n-1 must start with s0 (the first character) and the suffix of length n-1 must end with s_{n-1} (the last character).\n\n        So, for the two strings of length n-1:\n\n          Let A and B be the two strings.\n\n          Then, one of them must start with s0 and the other must end with s_{n-1}.\n\n        But wait, we don't know s0 and s_{n-1} yet. However, from length1 we have two possibilities.\n\n    This becomes complicated.\n\n    Let me try to think simpler:\n\n    We know the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes. The entire string s must be such that:\n\n        The set of all prefixes (of length from 1 to n-1) is exactly the given set of half the strings, and the set of all suffixes (of length from 1 to n-1) is the other half.\n\n    We can try to use the following:\n\n        The two strings of length 1: {a, b}. Then, the two strings of length 2: {c, d}. Then, the two strings of length 3: {e, f}, and so on.\n\n        The entire string s must have:\n\n            s0 = one of {a, b} (say a)\n            s_{n-1} = the other (b)\n\n        Then, the prefix of length2 must be a + x, and the suffix of length2 must be y + b.\n\n        Now, what is x? It is s1. And what is y? It is s_{n-2}.\n\n        Then, the prefix of length3 must be a + x + s2, and the suffix of length3 must be s_{n-3} + s_{n-2} + b.\n\n        Now, we have two strings of length3: one must be a+x+? and the other must be ? + s_{n-2}+b.\n\n        But note: the two strings of length3 must be the prefix and the suffix.\n\n        How do we choose? We can check:\n\n            The prefix of length3 must start with a and the suffix must end with b.\n\n        However, we don't know x and s_{n-2}. But we have the two strings of length2: one is a+x (prefix) and one is s_{n-2}+b (suffix). \n\n        From the two strings of length2, we know:\n\n            Let the two be: \n                A = a+x\n                B = s_{n-2}+b\n\n        Then, we can get x = A[1] (if we assume A is the prefix) OR if we assume B is the prefix then x = B[1]? But wait, the prefix must start with a, so the prefix is the one that starts with a. Similarly, the suffix must end with b, so the suffix is the one that ends with b.\n\n        So, we can assign:\n\n            For each length L, we can assign the string that matches the expected beginning (for prefix) or ending (for suffix) based on the previously determined parts.\n\n        However, we don't know the entire string. But we know the first and last characters from length1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. From the two length1 strings, we have two possibilities for the first and last characters.\n\n        2. Then, for each length L from 2 to n-1, we have two strings. We can assign:\n\n            - The prefix of length L must be the one that starts with the prefix of length L-1? No, that's not necessarily true for non-consecutive? Actually, the prefix of length L must start with the prefix of length L-1? Yes, because the prefix of length L is the prefix of length L-1 plus one more character.\n\n            Similarly, the suffix of length L must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n        But wait, we don't have the entire prefix of length L-1 and suffix of length L-1 until we assign them.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n            We know the first character (s0) and the last character (s_{n-1}).\n\n            For the two strings of length2:\n\n                The prefix must be the one that starts with s0.\n                The suffix must be the one that ends with s_{n-1}.\n\n            Then, for length3:\n\n                The prefix must be the one that starts with the prefix of length2 (which we have now) and the suffix must be the one that ends with the suffix of length2.\n\n            And so on.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Let groups = {}\n            for i in range(2*n-2):\n                read a string s_i, and group by len(s_i)\n\n            Then, we have groups: {1: [str1, str2], 2: [str3, str4], ...}\n\n            Then, we try the two possibilities for the length1:\n\n                Possibility 1: \n                    s0 = group[1][0], s_last = group[1][1]\n                Possibility 2:\n                    s0 = group[1][1], s_last = group[1][0]\n\n            Then, for each possibility, we try to assign the rest:\n\n                We'll create two lists: one for the assignment (to output) and one to mark which strings we've used.\n\n                But note: the input order matters for the output. We have to output the same order as the input, with each string labeled 'P' or 'S'.\n\n            Steps for one possibility:\n\n                We'll keep a mapping: for each string, whether it is assigned as prefix ('P') or suffix ('S').\n\n                We know the entire string s must be of length n, and we know s0 and s_last.\n\n                Then, for L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                    In the group[L], we have two strings.\n\n                    For the prefix: it must be the string that starts with the prefix of length L-1 (which we have already determined). Similarly, the suffix must be the string that ends with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n                However, we don't have the entire prefix of length L-1, but we do have the entire prefix of length L-1: it is the string we assigned as the prefix of length L-1.\n\n                But wait: the prefix of length L-1 is a string of length L-1. The prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 extended by one character.\n\n                Similarly, the suffix of length L must be the suffix of length L-1 extended by one character at the beginning.\n\n                So:\n\n                    For a candidate string in group[L] to be the prefix, it must be equal to the known prefix of length L-1 + one character. But we don't know the next character. However, the prefix of length L-1 is fixed, so the next character is determined: it is the character after the prefix of length L-1.\n\n                But wait, we don't know the entire string. How can we check? \n\n                Actually, we can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent. We can build the entire string from the prefixes, but we have two possibilities for the first character and then the rest is forced by the prefixes.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                    We have the two strings in group[L]. We know that one must be the prefix and one the suffix.\n\n                    Condition for prefix: \n                        The prefix of length L must start with the prefix of length L-1 (which we know) and the next character is arbitrary? But we don't know the next character. However, we can compare the two strings in group[L] with the known prefix of length L-1.\n\n                    Specifically, the prefix of length L must be the known prefix of length L-1 plus one character. Therefore, the two strings of length L must be:\n\n                        candidate1 = prefix_{L-1} + char1\n                        candidate2 = something else\n\n                    But note: the prefix of length L-1 is fixed, so candidate1 must start with prefix_{L-1}. The other candidate does not have to, unless we require that the suffix of length L must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n                Similarly, the suffix of length L must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n                Therefore, we can assign:\n\n                    For group[L]:\n                        candidate_prefix = the string in group[L] that starts with the known prefix of length L-1 (if any) and has length L.\n                        candidate_suffix = the string in group[L] that ends with the known suffix of length L-1 (if any) and has length L.\n\n                But wait, what if both conditions hold for the same string? Then we have a problem.\n\n                However, note: the two strings are distinct? Not necessarily (like the example \"aaa\" for n=3). But in that case, the two strings of length2 are both \"aa\", so we have two identical strings. Then, we cannot tell which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix? \n\n                But note: the problem says \"exactly two strings of each length\", and they can be the same.\n\n                How to handle duplicates?\n\n                Actually, we can use the following:\n\n                    We know the entire string s must be consistent. We can try to build the entire string from the prefixes. If we take all the prefixes (the ones we assign as 'P'), then we should get a string of length n, and similarly from the suffixes (the ones we assign as 'S') we should get the same string when reversed.\n\n                However, we don't know the entire string until we assign all.\n\n                Alternate plan:\n\n                Since n is at most 100, and we have only two possibilities for the first group (length1) and then the rest is forced, we can try the two possibilities and see which one leads to a consistent assignment for all groups.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Possibility 1: \n                      Let s0 = group[1][0], s_last = group[1][1]\n\n                  Then, for L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                      In group[L], we have two strings.\n\n                      Condition for a string to be the prefix of length L: \n                          It must start with the known prefix of length L-1 (which we have from the previous step).\n\n                      Condition for a string to be the suffix of length L:\n                          It must end with the known suffix of length L-1.\n\n                  But wait, we don't have the known prefix of length L-1 until we assign it. However, we can assign the two strings in group[L] as follows:\n\n                      Option A: \n                          Let candidate_prefix = the string in group[L] that starts with the known prefix of length L-1 (if there is one) and candidate_suffix = the other.\n\n                      But we don't know the entire prefix of length L-1 and suffix of length L-1. Actually, we do:\n\n                          We have already assigned the prefix of length L-1 (from group[L-1]) and the suffix of length L-1.\n\n                  So:\n\n                    Let P_{L-1} = the string we assigned as prefix for length L-1 (which is the entire prefix of length L-1)\n                    Let S_{L-1} = the string we assigned as suffix for length L-1.\n\n                    Then, for group[L]:\n\n                        The prefix of length L must be P_{L-1} + (one char) -> so it must start with P_{L-1}.\n\n                        The suffix of length L must be (one char) + S_{L-1} -> so it must end with S_{L-1}.\n\n                    Then, we have two strings. We can check:\n\n                        candidate1 = the one that starts with P_{L-1}\n                        candidate2 = the one that ends with S_{L-1}\n\n                    If candidate1 and candidate2 are different, then we assign candidate1 as 'P' and candidate2 as 'S'.\n\n                    If they are the same, then we have a problem: then the same string satisfies both conditions. Then we must check if the two strings are the same? \n\n                    Actually, if the two strings are the same, then we have two identical strings. Then, we can assign arbitrarily? But note: we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix. But if they are the same, then we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. However, the condition for the prefix and suffix is independent.\n\n                    But wait, the condition for the prefix is that it starts with P_{L-1}, and the condition for the suffix is that it ends with S_{L-1}. In this case, the same string satisfies both. Then we have two possibilities:\n\n                        Possibility 1: assign this string as prefix and the other occurrence (which is the same) as suffix -> but wait, we only have two strings and they are the same. Then we have two identical strings. Then we can assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n                    However, note: the two strings in group[L] are two strings (they could be duplicates). So if they are duplicates, then both are the same.\n\n                    Example: n=3, then for L=2, we have two strings of length2, both \"aa\". Then, we assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'. \n\n                    But then, the condition for the prefix of length2: must start with the prefix of length1 (which is 'a') -> \"aa\" starts with 'a' -> ok.\n                    The condition for the suffix of length2: must end with the suffix of length1 (which is 'a') -> \"aa\" ends with 'a' -> ok.\n\n                    So we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n                    However, we must assign both. Since there are two identical strings, we can assign the first occurrence as 'P' and the second as 'S', or vice versa.\n\n                    But note: the input order is arbitrary, but we must output the same order as the input.\n\n                    Therefore, we must remember the original indices.\n\n                Implementation:\n\n                  We are given 2n-2 strings in an arbitrary order.\n\n                  We need to output a string of length 2n-2 (each character is 'P' or 'S') in the same order as the input.\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    Step 1: Read all the strings and keep track of the original index.\n\n                    Step 2: Group by length, but also keep the index.\n\n                    Step 3: Try the two possibilities for the first group (length1):\n\n                        Possibility 1: \n                            Let s0 = string at index i (from the two in length1) and s_last = the other.\n\n                        Step 4: For each length L from 2 to n-1 (i.e., from 2 to n-1, inclusive) and also we have to assign the two length1 strings.\n\n                        But note: we have two length1 strings. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n                    How to assign the length1?\n\n                        For the two strings of length1, we can assign:\n\n                            candidate1: first string as prefix, second as suffix.\n                            candidate2: first string as suffix, second as prefix.\n\n                        Then, for each candidate, we proceed.\n\n                    However, the problem says we can output any consistent answer.\n\n                    We'll do:\n\n                        Let's store the input as a list of tuples: (index, string)\n\n                    Then, for each possibility for length1, we will:\n\n                        Let groups = dictionary: key=length, value = list of (index, string) for that length.\n\n                        Then, for each length from 1 to n-1, we assign the two strings.\n\n                    But note: the length1 assignment is the first step.\n\n                    Then, for length L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                        We have two (index, string) in groups[L].\n\n                        We know the prefix of length L-1 (which is the string we assigned as prefix from groups[L-1]) and the suffix of length L-1 (assigned from groups[L-1]).\n\n                        Then, for the two strings in groups[L]:\n\n                            Condition for being prefix: string.startswith(prefix_{L-1})\n                            Condition for being suffix: string.endswith(suffix_{L-1})\n\n                        Then, we have two cases:\n\n                            Case 1: One string satisfies the prefix condition and the other satisfies the suffix condition. Then we assign the prefix condition string as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n                            Case 2: Both satisfy both conditions (or one satisfies both). Then we have ambiguity.\n\n                        But note: the two strings are of length L. The prefix_{L-1} is of length L-1. The condition for prefix: the string must be exactly the known prefix_{L-1} extended by one character? Actually, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 plus one character. So the string must be the known prefix_{L-1} + any character. But the two strings in group[L] are given, so one of them must be the known prefix_{L-1} + (some char) and the other must be (some char) + known suffix_{L-1}. \n\n                        However, if the two strings are the same, then we have two identical strings. Then we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n                    But wait, the condition for the prefix is that it starts with prefix_{L-1}. Similarly, the condition for the suffix is that it ends with suffix_{L-1}. \n\n                    Example: \n                        L=2, prefix_{1} = \"a\", suffix_{1} = \"b\"\n                        The two strings: [\"aa\", \"bb\"] -> then \"aa\" starts with \"a\" and \"bb\" ends with \"b\". So we assign \"aa\" as prefix and \"bb\" as suffix.\n\n                    Example2:\n                        L=2, prefix_{1} = \"a\", suffix_{1} = \"a\"\n                        The two strings: [\"aa\", \"aa\"]\n                        Then, both conditions are satisfied by both strings. Then we can assign either as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n                    Therefore, algorithm for a given possibility (for length1):\n\n                        Let assignment = {}  # mapping: index -> label ('P' or 'S')\n                        Let prefix_known = {}  # for each length L (from 1 to n-1) we store the chosen prefix string (if we assigned one)\n                        Let suffix_known = {}  # similarly\n\n                        Step 1: For the two strings in length1:\n                            Let the two be (i1, a) and (i2, b)\n                            Option1: assign a as prefix and b as suffix.\n\n                                assignment[i1] = 'P'\n                                assignment[i2] = 'S'\n                                prefix_known[1] = a\n                                suffix_known[1] = b\n\n                        Then, for L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                            Get the two (index, string) in groups[L].\n\n                            Let cand1 = None, cand2 = None\n\n                            We'll check:\n\n                                candidate_prefix = None\n                                candidate_suffix = None\n\n                            For each string in the group (with index j):\n\n                                Check if the string starts with prefix_known[L-1] (for the prefix condition) -> then this string can be the prefix of length L.\n\n                                Check if the string ends with suffix_known[L-1] (for the suffix condition) -> then this string can be the suffix of length L.\n\n                            Then, we have two candidates: one for prefix and one for suffix.\n\n                            But note: we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n                            Cases:\n\n                                Case 1: There is one string that satisfies the prefix condition and one that satisfies the suffix condition, and they are different.\n\n                                    Then, assign the prefix condition string as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n                                Case 2: Both strings satisfy the prefix condition OR both satisfy the suffix condition.\n\n                                    Then, we must choose one as prefix and the other as suffix arbitrarily.\n\n                                    But note: we don't know which one is which, but we have two strings and two conditions. Actually, if both satisfy the prefix condition, then we cannot use the suffix condition? \n\n                                    However, we know that the entire set must be the prefixes and suffixes. The two strings are the only two of length L. One must be the prefix and one the suffix.\n\n                                    But if both satisfy the prefix condition, then the suffix condition must be satisfied by one of them? Or vice versa.\n\n                                    Actually, the condition for the suffix is that it ends with the suffix of length L-1. So we must check the suffix condition for both.\n\n                                    Let me reexamine:\n\n                                        The prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 + one char -> so it must start with the prefix of length L-1.\n\n                                        The suffix of length L must be one char + the suffix of length L-1 -> so it must end with the suffix of length L-1.\n\n                                    Therefore, if a string satisfies the prefix condition, it doesn't necessarily satisfy the suffix condition, and vice versa.\n\n                                    But in Case 2: \n\n                                        Possibility: \n                                            String1: satisfies prefix condition and suffix condition.\n                                            String2: satisfies nothing? -> then we cannot assign.\n\n                                        However, the problem guarantees that there is at least one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to assign each string correctly as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S'). The key insight is that prefixes must start with the corresponding shorter prefix, and suffixes must end with the corresponding shorter suffix. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process each group separately.\n2. **Handle Length 1 Strings**: The two strings of length 1 must be assigned one as the prefix and the other as the suffix. We consider both possible assignments (i.e., the first string as prefix and the second as suffix, or vice versa).\n3. **Process Longer Strings**: For each subsequent length from 2 to `n-1`, we check the two strings in that group:\n   - **Prefix Check**: A string can be a prefix if it starts with the known prefix of the previous length.\n   - **Suffix Check**: A string can be a suffix if it ends with the known suffix of the previous length.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Based on the checks, assign 'P' to the string that meets the prefix condition and 'S' to the one that meets the suffix condition. If both conditions are met by the same string, assign arbitrarily (since duplicates are allowed).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    strings = []\n    index_line = 1\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = data[index_line + i].strip()\n        strings.append(s)\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for i, s in enumerate(strings):\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append((i, s))\n    \n    ans = [''] * len(strings)\n    valid_ans = None\n    \n    for perm in [0, 1]:\n        prefix_known = {}\n        suffix_known = {}\n        assignment = {}\n        found_issue = False\n        \n        if perm == 0:\n            idx1, str1 = groups[1][0]\n            idx2, str2 = groups[1][1]\n            prefix_known[1] = str1\n            suffix_known[1] = str2\n            assignment[idx1] = 'P'\n            assignment[idx2] = 'S'\n        else:\n            idx1, str1 = groups[1][0]\n            idx2, str2 = groups[1][1]\n            prefix_known[1] = str2\n            suffix_known[1] = str1\n            assignment[idx1] = 'S'\n            assignment[idx2] = 'P'\n        \n        for L in range(2, n):\n            if L not in groups:\n                continue\n            lst = groups[L]\n            cand_P = None\n            cand_S = None\n            for idx, s_str in lst:\n                if s_str.startswith(prefix_known[L-1]):\n                    cand_P = s_str\n                    break\n            for idx, s_str in reversed(lst):\n                if s_str.endswith(suffix_known[L-1]):\n                    cand_S = s_str\n                    break\n            \n            if cand_P is None or cand_S is None:\n                found_issue = True\n                break\n            \n            if cand_P == cand_S:\n                idx1, cand_P_str = next((tup for tup in lst if tup[1] == cand_P), None)\n                idx2, cand_S_str = next((tup for tup in lst if tup[1] == cand_S), None)\n                assignment[idx1] = 'P'\n                assignment[idx2] = 'S'\n            else:\n                idx1, cand_P_str = next((tup for tup in lst if tup[1] == cand_P), None)\n                idx2, cand_S_str = next((tup for tup in lst if tup[1] == cand_S), None)\n                assignment[idx1] = 'P'\n                assignment[idx2] = 'S'\n            \n            prefix_known[L] = cand_P\n            suffix_known[L] = cand_S\n        \n        if not found_issue:\n            for i in range(len(strings)):\n                if i in assignment:\n                    ans[i] = assignment[i]\n            valid_ans = ''.join(ans)\n            break\n    \n    print(valid_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual lines. The first line is the length `n` of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: All subsequent strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of tuples (original index, string).\n3. **Handling Length 1 Strings**: The two strings of length 1 are considered in both possible assignments (first as prefix, second as suffix, or vice versa).\n4. **Processing Longer Strings**: For each length from 2 to `n-1`, the algorithm checks which string can be a prefix (starts with the known prefix of the previous length) and which can be a suffix (ends with the known suffix of the previous length). The checks are done by examining the strings in the group.\n5. **Assigning Labels**: Based on the checks, strings are labeled 'P' or 'S'. If a string satisfies both conditions, it is still labeled appropriately (handling duplicates if necessary).\n6. **Output**: The first valid assignment found (considering both possibilities for length 1 strings) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible assignments by leveraging the hierarchical structure of prefixes and suffixes, ensuring correctness while handling all edge cases.",
