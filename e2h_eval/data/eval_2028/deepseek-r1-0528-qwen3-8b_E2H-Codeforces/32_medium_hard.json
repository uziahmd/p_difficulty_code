    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element might change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` (after sorting). Then the overall instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n However, we are allowed to remove one element. We can consider two types of removals:\n  1. Removing an occurrence of the minimum element (if there are multiple minima, removing one might leave others).\n  2. Removing an occurrence of the maximum element.\n\n But note: sometimes the best removal is not necessarily at the ends. Actually, let's think:\n\n After removal, the new min will be the smallest element that remains, and the new max will be the largest element that remains.\n\n We can consider removing an element at index i. Then the new array would have:\n   new_min = min(a[0:i]) if the removed element is not the global min? Actually, we can do better by considering:\n\n However, note: the min and max of the entire array are fixed. Removing an element that is not the min doesn't change the min?\n Actually, the min is the smallest element. If we remove one occurrence of the min, then the min becomes the next smallest (if exists) but if we remove a non-min, the min remains.\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n So, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove the first occurrence of the min. Then the new min is the next smallest value (which might be the same min if there are duplicates) but wait, if we remove one min, then the next smallest is the next distinct value or the same min if duplicates exist.\n\n Actually, we can use the sorted array.\n\n Steps:\n  Sort the array.\n\n  Consider the following possibilities:\n    Remove the first element (the smallest): then the new array has min = a[1] (if n>1) and max = a[-1]. Instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n    Remove the last element (the largest): then the new array has min = a[0] and max = a[-2]. Instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n  But what if we remove an element in the middle? Then the min and max might remain unchanged (if the removed element was not the only min or the only max). However, note that if we remove an element that is the min, then the min changes (unless there are duplicates). Similarly for max.\n\n  Actually, we can consider two candidate removals that might change the min or max:\n\n    Candidate 1: Removing the leftmost min (so the array after removal has the next smallest as the new min, but the max remains the same unless the max is the same as the min? no, because we remove one element and the max might be still present)\n    Candidate 2: Removing the rightmost max.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. Therefore, we can also remove an element that is not the min or max. But then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains the original (a[-1]-a[0]), which is likely not optimal.\n\n  So the idea is: we want to minimize the instability, which is (max - min). We can try to remove one element that might help reduce the range.\n\n  How?\n\n  We note that the overall instability is determined by the extreme values. The only way to reduce the instability is to remove an extreme value (either the min or the max) or both? Actually, we can only remove one.\n\n  However, consider: if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the min and max don't change, so the instability remains the same.\n\n  So the minimal instability must come from either removing the min or the max.\n\n  But wait: what if the array has duplicate min or duplicate max? Then removing one min doesn't necessarily remove the min from the array. For example, [1,1,3] -> if we remove one 1, the min remains 1. Then the instability is still 3-1=2.\n\n  Therefore, we should consider:\n\n    Removing an element that is the min: then the new min is the next smallest distinct value? Actually, the next smallest value (which might be the same as the original min if duplicates exist).\n\n  We can think differently: after sorting, the array is [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}].\n\n  The goal is to choose an index i to remove such that:\n      new_min = \n          if i==0: then the new min is x1 (if n>=2) OR if there are duplicates of x0, then we can remove one and the min remains x0 until we remove all duplicates?\n      Actually, we can compute the instability after removal of index i without actually building the new array by:\n\n        Let L = the smallest value that remains, which is:\n            If we remove an element that is not the smallest, then the smallest remains x0.\n            If we remove the smallest, then the smallest becomes the next smallest value (which is the smallest value in the remaining array). But note: if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one occurrence, the smallest might still be x0.\n\n        Similarly for the largest.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  We know that the answer is the minimum over i of (max_after_i - min_after_i).\n\n  We can precompute:\n\n      Let b = sorted(a)\n\n      Then, for each removal i, the min_after_i = \n          if b[i] == b[0]:\n              then the new min is the minimum of the remaining array. But note: if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the new min is the next distinct value? Actually, we can use:\n\n      Instead, note that the min of the array without the element at index i is:\n          If b[i] is the global min and there's only one occurrence, then the new min is b[1] (if n>1). But if there are duplicates, then the new min is still b[0] (because we only removed one duplicate).\n\n      Similarly, the max of the array without the element at index i is:\n          If b[i] is the global max and there's only one occurrence, then the new max is b[-2]. Otherwise, it remains b[-1].\n\n  But wait, we can avoid checking every index by noting:\n\n      The instability after removal of an element at index i is:\n          min_after = \n            if b[i] == b[0] and i==0: then we look at the next element? Actually, we can define:\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let L[i] = the minimum of the subarray from 0 to i-1 and from i+1 to n-1? That would be too slow.\n\n  Insight:\n\n      The overall instability without removal is b[-1]-b[0]. Removal can only help if we remove an element that is either the min or the max.\n\n      But wait, consider an array with distinct elements: [1,2,3,4]. \n        Removing 1: [2,3,4] -> instability 3\n        Removing 2: [1,3,4] -> instability 3\n        Removing 3: [1,2,4] -> instability 3\n        Removing 4: [1,2,3] -> instability 2\n\n      So the best is to remove the maximum.\n\n      Now, what if the array has duplicates? [1,1,2,3] (n=4)\n        Removing the first 1: [1,2,3] -> instability 2\n        Removing the second 1: [1,2,3] -> instability 2\n        Removing 2: [1,1,3] -> instability 2\n        Removing 3: [1,1,2] -> instability 1\n\n      But wait, the overall min is 1 and max is 3. Removing 3 gives an array [1,1,2] with min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n\n      Also, removing one of the 1's gives [1,2,3] with instability 2.\n\n      Now, consider [1,2,3,3] (remove one 3): [1,2,3] -> instability 2; remove the other 3: [1,2,3] -> instability 2; remove 1: [2,3,3] -> instability 1; remove 2: [1,3,3] -> instability 2.\n\n      So we see that sometimes removing a non-extreme element (like 2) doesn't help, but removing an extreme (min or max) helps.\n\n      However, note: in the example [1,2,3,3] the min is 1 and max is 3. Removing the min (1) gives [2,3,3] -> instability 1, which is better than removing the max (3) which gives [1,2,3] -> instability 2.\n\n      So the candidate removals are:\n\n        Candidate 1: Remove an occurrence of the global min (if any) -> then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the min if there are duplicates, or the next distinct if not). Actually, if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the new min is the smallest value in the remaining array. But note: the min of the entire array is the smallest element. So if there are multiple min, then the min doesn't change.\n\n        Similarly, for the max.\n\n      Therefore, we can consider:\n\n        Option A: Remove one occurrence of the global min (if available). Then the new min is:\n            If the frequency of the global min is more than 1: then the min remains the same (global min). Then the instability becomes (global max) - (global min) [same as before] but wait, we removed one min so the max remains the same? Actually, no: the max is still the same because we didn't remove the max. So the instability remains the same.\n\n            But wait: if we remove one min and the min appears multiple times, then the min doesn't change, but the max doesn't change either. So the instability remains the same.\n\n        Option B: Remove one occurrence of the global max (if available). Similarly, if the max appears multiple times, then the max doesn't change, so the instability remains the same.\n\n      However, in the example [1,1,2,3]: \n          Removing one min: the min remains 1, the max remains 3 -> instability 2.\n          Removing one max: the min remains 1, the max becomes 2 (because we removed the 3) -> instability 1.\n\n      So we see that if we remove the max, the instability decreases. But if we remove the min, and the min appears multiple times, then the instability does not decrease.\n\n      But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max? Then the min and max don't change, so the instability remains the original.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal instability must be achieved by one of the two operations: removing an element that is the global max OR removing an element that is the global min (but only when the min appears only once? because if there are multiple, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so we get the same instability). \n\n      However, consider: [1,2,3] (all distinct). \n          Removing min: [2,3] -> instability 1 (original was 2, so improvement)\n          Removing max: [1,2] -> instability 1 (same improvement)\n\n      Now, what if we remove an element that is the min but there are duplicates? [1,1,2,3]:\n          Removing one min: [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability 2 (same as original)\n          Removing one max: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1 (better)\n\n      So the idea is: we must consider removing the min and the max, but note:\n\n        Removing the min: \n            new_min = \n                if the min appears only once: then the new min is the next smallest (which is the first element greater than min) -> then the instability becomes (max) - (next smallest)\n                if the min appears more than once: then the new min is still the min -> so the instability remains (max) - (min) [unchanged]\n\n        Similarly for the max.\n\n      Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        candidate1 = (if the min appears only once) then (b[-1] - b[1]) else (b[-1] - b[0])\n        candidate2 = (if the max appears only once) then (b[-2] - b[0]) else (b[-1] - b[0])\n\n      But wait, in the example [1,1,2,3]:\n          candidate1: min appears twice -> so candidate1 = (3 - 1) = 2.\n          candidate2: max appears once -> candidate2 = (2 - 1) = 1.\n\n      Then the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2) = 1.\n\n      However, what about removing an element that is neither the min nor the max? In this case, we don't consider, because the instability would be the same as the original (3-1=2) which is worse than 1.\n\n      But wait, what if the array is [1,2,3,4]? \n          candidate1: min is 1 (appears once) -> candidate1 = 4-2 = 2.\n          candidate2: max is 4 (appears once) -> candidate2 = 3-1 = 2.\n          Then answer = 2.\n\n      However, we saw earlier that removing the max (4) gives [1,2,3] -> instability 2, and removing the min (1) gives [2,3,4] -> instability 2. And removing any other element (like 2) leaves [1,3,4] -> instability 3, which is worse. So 2 is the minimum.\n\n      Now, consider [1,2,2,3]:\n          Original instability: 3-1=2.\n          Removing the min (1): candidate1: min appears once -> new min is 2, so instability = 3-2 = 1.\n          Removing the max (3): candidate2: max appears once -> new max is 2, so instability = 2-1 = 1.\n          Then answer = 1.\n\n      But wait, what if we remove a duplicate (one of the 2's)? Then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 2, which is worse.\n\n      So the candidates are only the removals of the min and the max.\n\n      However, wait: what if the array has multiple mins and multiple maxes? Example: [1,1,2,2,3] (n=5)\n          Removing one min (1): \n              Since there are two 1's, the min remains 1 -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n          Removing one max (3):\n              Since there is only one 3, the max becomes 2 -> instability = 2-1 = 1.\n\n      So the answer is 1.\n\n      But note: the array [1,1,2,2,3] has:\n          candidate1: min appears more than once -> candidate1 = 3-1 = 2.\n          candidate2: max appears once -> candidate2 = 2-1 = 1.\n\n      However, what if we remove a min that is duplicated? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same. But we can also remove a max that is duplicated? Actually, if the max appears multiple times, then removing one occurrence doesn't change the max.\n\n      Example: [1,2,3,3] (min=1, max=3, and max appears twice)\n          candidate1: min appears once -> candidate1 = 3-2 = 1.\n          candidate2: max appears twice -> candidate2 = 3-1 = 2 (because removing one 3, the max remains 3).\n\n      Then the answer is min(1,2)=1.\n\n      But wait, what if we remove one of the 3's? Then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 2, which is worse than 1.\n\n      Actually, we considered candidate1: removing the min (1) -> [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1, which is correct.\n\n      So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n        Step 2: Sort the list.\n        Step 3: Count the frequency of the min and max.\n\n        However, we don't need the full frequency counts for all elements, just for the min and max.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = None\n          candidate_remove_max = None\n\n        But note: we don't necessarily have to remove the min or the max? Actually, we argued that removing a non-extreme element doesn't help, so we only consider removals that are the min or the max.\n\n        However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,4,5]?\n          Removing the min (1): [2,4,5] -> instability 3\n          Removing the max (5): [1,2,4] -> instability 3\n          Removing the element 2: [1,4,5] -> instability 4 (worse)\n          Removing the element 4: [1,2,5] -> instability 4 (worse)\n\n        So the minimal instability is 3.\n\n        But what if we remove the element 2? Then the instability is 4, which is worse.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,100,101,102] (with min=1, max=102)?\n          Removing the min: [100,101,102] -> instability 2\n          Removing the max: [1,100,101] -> instability 100\n\n        So the minimal instability is 2.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider:\n\n          candidate1: remove one occurrence of the min (if exists) -> then the new min is the next distinct min (if the min appears only once, then the next smallest; if multiple, then the min remains). Then the instability is (max if we don't remove the max) minus (new min).\n\n          candidate2: remove one occurrence of the max (if exists) -> then the new max is the next distinct max (if the max appears only once, then the next largest; if multiple, then the max remains). Then the instability is (new max) minus (min).\n\n        But wait: when we remove the min, the max remains the same (unless we remove the max, but we are only removing one element). Similarly, when we remove the max, the min remains the same.\n\n        So:\n\n          candidate1: \n            If the min appears only once, then the new min is the second smallest (b[1]) and the max is still b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n            Else (min appears multiple times), then the new min is still b[0] and the max is still b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original)\n\n          candidate2:\n            If the max appears only once, then the new max is the second largest (b[-2]) and the min is still b[0] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n            Else (max appears multiple times), then the new max is still b[-1] and the min is still b[0] -> instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original)\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, but wait: what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max? Then the instability remains the original. However, we are looking for the minimum, so we take the minimum among:\n\n          candidate1 (if we remove a min) and candidate2 (if we remove a max) and the original instability if we remove a non-extreme? Actually, no: because we are allowed to remove any one element, and we are trying to minimize the instability.\n\n        But note: the original instability is b[-1]-b[0]. However, we are only considering two candidates. But what if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max? Then the instability is the same as the original, so we don't need to consider because we can get at least as good as the original by removing an extreme.\n\n        However, wait: what if the original instability is already the minimum? Then we don't need to consider the original? Actually, we are allowed to remove any element, and we are trying to minimize the instability.\n\n        But note: the problem says we have to remove exactly one element.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum value among:\n          candidate1 (if we remove a min) and candidate2 (if we remove a max) and the original instability? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability remains the original, which is not better than candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        But wait: we are not forced to remove the min or the max. We can remove any element. However, if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability doesn't change. So the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, because the original instability (if we don't remove an extreme) is worse than or equal to candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        Actually, let's compare:\n\n          candidate1 and candidate2 are computed by assuming we remove a min or a max.\n\n          But note: the original instability (without removal) is not allowed because we must remove one element. However, if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability is the original (b[-1]-b[0]). But we can also remove an element that is the min or the max and get candidate1 or candidate2.\n\n        However, note: the original instability is the value for the entire array. When we remove an element, the instability changes. But if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original (b[-1]-b[0]). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n          candidate1, candidate2, and the original instability (if we remove a non-extreme element, we get the original instability, but we are allowed to remove any element, so we can choose to remove an extreme and get candidate1 or candidate2, which might be smaller than the original).\n\n        However, wait: when we remove an extreme, we might get a lower instability. But note: the original instability is the value for the entire array, and after removal the array is different. The original instability is not a candidate because we are forced to remove one element.\n\n        Actually, we are comparing:\n\n          candidate1: instability after removing a min (if we can, i.e., if there is at least one min)\n          candidate2: instability after removing a max (if we can, i.e., if there is at least one max)\n\n        And we must consider that we can remove one element. The minimal instability is the minimum of these two candidates.\n\n        But wait, what if we have an array with all the same number? Then the instability is 0. Removing one element: the array becomes n-1 copies of that number, so instability is still 0.\n\n        Example: [5,5,5] -> \n            candidate1: min appears multiple times -> instability = 5-5 = 0.\n            candidate2: max appears multiple times -> instability = 5-5 = 0.\n\n        Then the answer is 0.\n\n        However, note: the original instability is 0, but we are removing one element so the array has two 5's -> instability 0.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n          Step 2: Sort the list a.\n          Step 3: Let total_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n          Step 4: \n            candidate1 = total_instability   # default if we remove a min that doesn't change the min (i.e., duplicate min) then instability remains total_instability, but if we remove a single min then we get a different value.\n            candidate2 = total_instability    # similarly for max.\n\n          But wait, we need to compute:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = \n                if there is at least one occurrence of a[0] and if the frequency of a[0] is 1, then the instability becomes a[-1] - a[1]\n                else (frequency > 1) then the instability remains a[-1] - a[0]\n\n            Similarly, candidate_remove_max = \n                if the frequency of a[-1] is 1, then the instability becomes a[-2] - a[0]\n                else, remains a[-1] - a[0]\n\n          However, how to check frequency? We can do:\n\n            count_min = 1\n            i = 0\n            while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n                count_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n            Similarly for max.\n\n          But note: the array is sorted, so duplicates of min are consecutive at the beginning, duplicates of max are consecutive at the end.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            count_min = (number of times a[0] appears) = the first index where the value is not a[0] (then count_min = index)\n            But wait, we can use:\n\n            # For min:\n            j = 0\n            while j < n and a[j] == a[0]:\n                j += 1\n            count_min = j   # because from index0 to j-1 are the min\n\n            Similarly for max:\n\n            j = n-1\n            while j>=0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n                j -= 1\n            count_max = n-1 - j   # because from j+1 to n-1 are the max\n\n          Then:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = \n                if count_min == 1: \n                    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                else:\n                    candidate1 = total_instability   # because the min doesn't change\n\n            candidate_remove_max = \n                if count_max == 1:\n                    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n                else:\n                    candidate2 = total_instability\n\n          Then the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n          But wait: what if the array has only two elements? Then removing the min: \n            [x,y] (sorted) -> remove x: then array [y] -> instability 0? But the problem says n>=2, so n=2 is allowed.\n\n          Example [1,2]: \n            total_instability = 1\n            count_min: 1 (only one 1) -> candidate1 = 2 - a[1] -> but wait, a[1] is the next element? Actually, for n=2, after removing the first element, the array is [2] -> instability 0. But our formula for candidate1: \n                candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1] -> a[-1]=2, a[1] is out of bounds? \n\n          Correction: when n=2, the sorted array is [a0, a1]. Then:\n            Removing a0: the array becomes [a1] -> so the min and max are a1, so instability = 0.\n\n          How do we compute that?\n\n          We must be careful: the instability after removal of the min (if the min appears only once) is the range of the remaining array.\n\n          The remaining array is the entire array without the min. Then the min becomes the next smallest (if exists) and the max is the same (if the min wasn't the only element).\n\n          But when we remove the min and the array has two elements, then the next smallest is the next element, but then the array has one element so the range is 0.\n\n          We can define:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = \n                if count_min == 1:\n                    # Then the new min is the smallest value in the array without the first occurrence of a[0]. \n                    # Since the array is sorted, the next element (if any) is the next distinct value. But if there are no other elements, then the array becomes empty? No, we remove one element so we have n-1 elements.\n\n                    # Actually, the remaining array is a[1:] (if we remove the first element). Then the new min is the minimum of a[1:], which is a[1] (if n>=2). Then the new max is a[-1] (unless the removed element was the max, but we are only removing the min). But wait, if the min is the same as the max? Then n==1, but n>=2.\n\n                    # But note: if the array has two elements and they are the same, then the min appears twice, so we don't enter this branch.\n\n            So for n=2 and distinct elements: \n                candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[1]   -> a[-1] is the last element (which is a[1]) and a[1] is the same, so 0.\n\n          Actually, the remaining array has one element, so the min and max are the same.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the instability after removing the min (if we remove one occurrence) as:\n\n            new_min = \n                if the array has only one element left: then that element is both min and max -> 0.\n                else: the smallest element in the remaining array, which is the first element of the remaining array (since sorted) or the next distinct value? Actually, we don't need the next distinct value, we need the entire set.\n\n          But note: we can simply say:\n\n            After removing the min (if there is only one occurrence), the new min is the next smallest element (which is the first element of the remaining part). Then the new max is the last element (unless the max was the same as the min, but then the array would have been all same and we wouldn't be in this branch).\n\n          However, in the two-element distinct array, the remaining array is [a1] (one element) so the min and max are a1, so the instability is 0.\n\n          How to compute the instability after removal of the min (one occurrence) without knowing the entire set?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = \n                if count_min == 1:\n                    # Remove the first occurrence of the min (at index0). Then the remaining array is a[1:] (from index1 to the end).\n                    # The new min is the min of a[1:], which is a[1] (since sorted). The new max is a[-1] (unless the removed element was the max, but we are only removing one element and the max is the last element, and if the min and max were the same then we wouldn't be here because then min and max are same and we have duplicate min, so count_min would be more than 1).\n\n                    # However, note: if the array has more than two elements, then the max is still the last element. But if the array has two elements, then the max is the second element, which is now the only element.\n\n                    # Actually, the instability is: \n                    #   new_min = a[1] (if n>=2, because we have at least two elements) but wait, if we remove the first element, then the array from index1 to the end has length n-1. The min of that array is a[1] and the max is a[-1] (the last element) if we haven't removed the max? \n\n                    # But wait: if we remove the min and the min is not the max, then the max remains the same. But if we remove the min and the min is the same as the max? Then the array was all the same, but then we would have count_min = n, so we wouldn't be in this branch.\n\n                    # Therefore, the new instability is: a[-1] - (min of the remaining array). The min of the remaining array is a[1] (because the array is sorted and we removed the first occurrence of the smallest, and the smallest is unique so the next element is the smallest remaining).\n\n                    # However, if the array has two elements, then the remaining array has one element, so the min and max of the remaining array is the same, so a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0.\n\n                    # But if the array has three or more, then the min of the remaining array is a[1] and the max is a[-1], so the instability is a[-1]-a[1].\n\n                    # Therefore, we can write:\n\n                    candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[1]   if n>=2 and count_min==1\n\n          But wait, what if the array has two elements and we remove the min? Then the remaining array has one element, so the min is a[1] and the max is a[1]. So a[-1] is a[1] and a[1] is a[1], so 0.\n\n          Similarly, for candidate_remove_max:\n\n            candidate_remove_max = \n                if count_max == 1:\n                    candidate_remove_max = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n          Example [1,2] (n=2): \n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1? Wait, no: \n                a[-1] is 2, a[1] is 2 (because the array is [1,2], so a[1]=2). Then 2-2=0.\n\n          But wait, in the array [1,2] the two-element array, the remaining array after removing the first element is [2] -> instability 0.\n\n          So the formula for candidate_remove_min is correct.\n\n          However, for candidate_remove_max in [1,2]: \n            count_max: the last element is 2, and the frequency of 2 is 1 -> candidate_remove_max = a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1 = 0.\n\n          Then the answer is min(0,0)=0.\n\n          Example [1,2,3] (n=3):\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 2-1 = 1.\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n          Example [1,2,2,3] (n=4):\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 2-1 = 1.\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n          Example [1,1,2,3] (n=4):\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=2 -> candidate_remove_min = 3-1 = 2.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 2-1 = 1.\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n          Example [1,2,3,3] (n=4):\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=2 -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n          Example [5,5,5] (n=3):\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=3 -> candidate_remove_min = 5-5 = 0.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=3 -> candidate_remove_max = 5-5 = 0.\n            Then answer = 0.\n\n          Example [1,100000] (n=2): \n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 1 - 1 = 0.\n            Then answer = 0.\n\n          This matches the sample input: ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000'] -> outputs ['2','0']\n\n          Wait, the sample input \"2\\n1 100000\" gives output 0, which matches.\n\n          But the first sample input: \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n\n            Array: [1,3,3,7] -> sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n            candidate_remove_min: count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 7 - 3 = 4.\n            candidate_remove_max: count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n\n            Then answer = 2.\n\n          However, the example output is 2.\n\n          But wait, the example says: \n            Input: ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n            Output: ['2', '0']\n\n          So our program returns 2 for the first and 0 for the second.\n\n          But wait, in the first example, why did we get candidate_remove_min=4? \n            candidate_remove_min: remove the min (1) -> the remaining array is [3,3,7]. The min is 3 and the max is 7 -> instability 4.\n\n          But the example says: \"In the first example you can remove 7 then instability of the remaining array will be 3-1=2.\"\n\n          So we must consider: the example removed the max, not the min.\n\n          Our candidate_remove_max: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that removing an element from the array can potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the minimum or the maximum (or both) of the array. If the removed element is not an extreme value, the instability remains unchanged.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the candidates for removal. The minimal instability will be achieved by either:\n   - Removing the first occurrence of the minimum element (if it appears only once), which sets the new minimum to the next smallest element.\n   - Removing the last occurrence of the maximum element (if it appears only once), which sets the new maximum to the next largest element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - Count the occurrences of the minimum and maximum elements to determine if their removal will change the extreme values.\n   - Calculate the potential instability for both scenarios (removing min or max) and choose the smaller value.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent steps involve linear scans to count occurrences, which are O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    total_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n    \n    # Count frequency of min\n    count_min = 1\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n        count_min += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Count frequency of max\n    count_max = 1\n    j = n-1\n    while j >= 0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n        count_max += 1\n        j -= 1\n        \n    candidate_remove_min = total_instability\n    if count_min == 1:\n        candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - a[1]\n        \n    candidate_remove_max = total_instability\n    if count_max == 1:\n        candidate_remove_max = a[-2] - a[0]\n        \n    answer = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily identify the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: The code counts how many times the minimum and maximum elements appear in the array. This helps determine if removing one instance of these elements will change the extreme values of the array.\n4. **Calculating Candidates**: \n   - If the minimum element appears only once, removing it changes the new minimum to the next smallest element, and the instability is recalculated.\n   - Similarly, if the maximum element appears only once, removing it changes the new maximum to the next largest element, and the instability is recalculated.\n5. **Result**: The minimum instability value between the two scenarios (removing min or max) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
