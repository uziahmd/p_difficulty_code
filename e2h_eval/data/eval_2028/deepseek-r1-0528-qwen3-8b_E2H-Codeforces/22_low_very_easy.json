After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject (column) what is the best mark (i.e., the maximum in that column). However, note that there might be multiple students with the same best mark for a subject. In that case, all those students are considered best at that subject.\n\n But note: The problem says \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student with a higher mark\", so even if there are multiple with the same highest, they are all best.\n\n 4. For a student to be successful, he must be the best in at least one subject.\n\n Approach:\n Let's create an array (or list) `students` which will hold the marks for each student as a list of integers.\n\n Alternatively, we can work directly with the grid.\n\n Steps:\n - We have a grid of n rows and m columns.\n\n For each subject j (0-indexed column), let best[j] = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) ) [but note: we are comparing characters, but they are digits from '1' to '9'. We can compare them as characters because '1'<'2'<...<'9'. \n\n Then, for each student i, check for any subject j such that grid[i][j] == best[j]. If at least one exists, then student i is successful.\n\n However, note: the input is given as a string of characters. We can read them as strings.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   We can represent as:\n        grid = [\n            ['2','2','3'],\n            ['2','3','2'],\n            ['1','1','2']\n        ]\n\n   For subject 0 (first column): best mark is '3' (from student 0 and student 1? Actually student0: '2', student1: '2', student2: '1' -> wait, wait: \n        Actually, first column: \n            student0: '2'\n            student1: '2'\n            student2: '1'\n        So the best mark in first column is '2'. Then student0 and student1 are best in subject0.\n\n   For subject1:\n        student0: '2'\n        student1: '3'\n        student2: '1'\n        best is '3'\n\n   For subject2:\n        student0: '3'\n        student1: '2'\n        student2: '2'\n        best is '3'\n\n   Now, check each student:\n      Student0: \n          subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes\n          subject1: '2' != '3' -> no\n          subject2: '3' == '3' -> yes -> so successful (at least one)\n      Student1:\n          subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes\n          subject1: '3' == '3' -> yes\n          subject2: '2' != '3' -> no -> successful\n      Student2:\n          subject0: '1' != '2'\n          subject1: '1' != '3'\n          subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Read n, m\n  grid = []\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      # if the input is given as a string of m characters, then we split by nothing, but the example input is given as a single string per line without spaces.\n      # However, the example input is provided as: \n      #   First line: \"3 3\"\n      #   Then three lines: \"223\", \"232\", \"112\"\n\n  But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline? We use strip to remove any trailing newline or spaces.\n\n  Then, for each column j in range(m):\n      col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n      best_mark[j] = max(col_vals)   # since the characters '1' to '9' are lexically ordered same as numerically.\n\n  Then, for each student i (row i), we check if there exists any j (column) such that grid[i][j] == best_mark[j]\n\n  Count the number of students for which this condition holds.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the input may be given as a string that includes the entire gradebook. The example input format is:\n\n      ['3 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Best Marks**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This mark is referred to as the best mark for that subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the best mark in any subject. If they have, they are counted as a successful student.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    best_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [int(grid[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n        best_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n    \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(grid[i][j]) == best_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n    \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the dimensions (n, m), and subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Best Marks**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark (best mark) for that subject.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if they have the best mark in any subject. If they do, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total number of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful gracefully.",
