After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means highest mark, and note: marks from 1 to 9)\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there is at least one subject in which he has the maximum mark (and note: if multiple students have the same maximum mark, they are all best in that subject).\n\n However, note: The problem says \"Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\n Approach:\n - We can precompute for each subject j, the maximum mark (let's call it max_mark[j]).\n - Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j: \n        gradebook[i][j] == max_mark[j]   [then student i is the best in subject j]\n\n But note: if two or more students have the same maximum mark in a subject, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n However, the above condition is sufficient: because if a student has the maximum mark in at least one subject, then he is successful.\n\n Steps in code:\n\n 1. Parse input.\n 2. Create a list `students` of n strings, each string of length m.\n 3. For each subject j (0-indexed column), find the maximum character (as a char) in that column.\n    - We can do: for j in range(m): max_mark[j] = max( row[j] for row in students )\n\n 4. Then, for each student i, iterate over each subject j and check if students[i][j] == max_mark[j]. If at least one such j exists, then student i is successful.\n\n 5. Count the number of successful students.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   Students = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   For subject 0: column is ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n   For subject 1: column is ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n   For subject 2: column is ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for each student:\n     Student0: '223' -> subject0: '2' matches max '2' -> successful.\n                subject1: '2' != '3' -> skip\n                subject2: '3' == '3' -> successful (already found one, so count this student)\n\n     Student1: '232' -> subject0: '2' matches -> successful.\n                subject1: '3' matches -> successful (but we only need one)\n                subject2: '2' != '3'\n\n     Student2: '112' -> subject0: '1' != '2'; subject1: '1' != '3'; subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Edge: n=0 or m=0? According to constraints, n, m>=1, so no need to handle 0.\n\n Code:\n\n Note: The input might be given as a string that includes the newline. We use splitlines() or readlines() but the example input is given as a string that we can split.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly.\n   Next n lines each containing m characters\n\n So we can read the entire input and split by newline.\n\n Example input format: \n   \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n We can do:\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   Then first line = data[0].split()\n   Then next n lines = data[1:1+n]\n\n Alternatively, we can read the first line, then the next n lines.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   import sys\n\n   lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if not lines: \n        # but n,m>=1, so probably not necessary\n   n, m = map(int, lines[0].split())\n   gradebook = []\n   for i in range(1, 1+n):\n        gradebook.append(lines[i].strip())\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string that might have been provided without newlines? Actually, the problem says the input is from stdin.\n\n However",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines to get each student's marks for all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This mark defines the \"best\" in that subject.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        gradebook.append(s)\n        \n    max_marks = [str(9)] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [row[j] for row in gradebook]\n        max_char = max(col)\n        max_marks[j] = max_char\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the input data line by line. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code determines the highest mark by examining all students' marks in that subject. This is stored in the `max_marks` list.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful, and we move to the next student once a success is found.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons for clarity and correctness.",
