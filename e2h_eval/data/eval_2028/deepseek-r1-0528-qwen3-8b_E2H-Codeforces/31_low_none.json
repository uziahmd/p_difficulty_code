Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can have any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x.\n\n 4. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum number k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each between -x and x) such that a1 + a2 + ... + ak = -S?\n\n 5. Note: We are allowed to choose any integers (positive, negative, or zero) as long as |a_i| <= x.\n\n 6. Since we want the minimum k, we can think greedily:\n\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n\n    - Otherwise, note that each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). But note: we can also mix.\n\n 7. Actually, we are allowed to use any combination. The key observation is that we can use cards to adjust the sum by up to k*x (in absolute value) in either direction, but note: we can also use negative and positive to cancel out.\n\n However, note: we are not limited to positive or negative only. The goal is to reach exactly -S.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   Let T = -S (the target adjustment).\n\n   We are to represent T as a linear combination of integers in the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x} (but note: we can choose any integer in that range, including zeros) with the minimum number of terms.\n\n 8. Alternatively, note that the best way to minimize the number of cards is to use the largest possible adjustments (in absolute value) and then fill the gap.\n\n 9. Consider:\n\n    We can use k cards. The maximum positive adjustment we can get is k*x (if all are x) and the maximum negative adjustment is -k*x (if all are -x). Therefore, the total adjustment must lie in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n    But note: we are allowed to use any integers. So we can achieve any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] provided that the parity condition (if any) is satisfied? Actually, no parity condition because we can use any integers.\n\n    However, we must check: what is the minimum k such that |T| <= k*x? \n\n    But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n    Example: \n        Suppose T = 3, x=2, then k=2: we can use [1,2] or [2,1] or [3] but wait, we can use one card if x>=3? but x=2, so we cannot use 3. Then we need two cards: 1 and 2, which sum to 3. But note: we can also use two cards to get 3: for example, 2 and 1.\n\n    However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So we can use both positive and negative. Actually, we might even use negative cards to help? Not directly because we need to achieve T=3, so we would use positive.\n\n    But consider: if T is negative, then we use negative cards.\n\n    However, there's a catch: sometimes we might need to use more than just the absolute value divided by x because we are constrained by the fact that we can only use integers.\n\n    Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that we must have k >= ceil(|T|/x). But wait, what if T is not divisible by 1? Actually, we can use any integers. \n\n    However, note: the adjustments must sum to T. The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|? \n\n    But wait, let me test with the examples:\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> S = (-1+1+2)=2, so T=-2.\n        Then we need to achieve -2. How many cards? \n            With k=1: we can choose a card of -2 (since | -2 |<=2) -> so yes, one card.\n\n        According to ceil(|T|/x): ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then figuring out the smallest number of cards required to adjust this sum to zero, given that each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards. This sum, let's call it `S`, is the initial value we need to adjust to zero.\n2. **Determine the Target Adjustment**: The target adjustment is `-S` because we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Adjustment**: If the current sum `S` is already zero, no additional cards are needed, so the answer is 0.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: For non-zero `S`, the minimum number of cards required is determined by how much we need to adjust the sum. Each card can contribute at most `x` in absolute value. Therefore, the minimal number of cards `k` is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target adjustment divided by `x`. This is because each card can adjust the sum by up to `x`, so we need enough cards to cover the required adjustment in magnitude.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    if total_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    adjustment_needed = abs(total_sum)\n    k = (adjustment_needed + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x` for any card, and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the integers on the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately 0 since no adjustment is needed.\n3. **Adjustment Calculation**: The absolute value of the sum is taken to determine the magnitude of adjustment required. The minimal number of cards needed is calculated by dividing this adjustment by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n4. **Output the Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with a constant time complexity for the calculations after reading the input.",
