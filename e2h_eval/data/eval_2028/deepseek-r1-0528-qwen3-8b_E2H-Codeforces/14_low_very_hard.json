He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count is given by the sum:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n The problem: Given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n Observation:\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then for a fixed m, the set of n with f(n) = m might be a consecutive range (or possibly empty) or even multiple disjoint ranges? Actually, note:\n\n   We have:\n     f(5*m) >= m, and f(5*m-1) might be less than m.\n\n   But note: the function f(n) increases only at multiples of 5. And when n increases, the trailing zeros can only stay the same or increase.\n\n   Therefore, for a given m, the numbers n such that f(n)=m must form an interval (if any exists) because once we reach a number with m zeros, until the next multiple of 5 (or until the next jump) the count remains m? Not exactly: actually, when we hit a number that causes an additional factor of 5 (like 25, which contributes two zeros), then the count jumps by more than one sometimes.\n\n   However, note that the function f(n) is constant on intervals between multiples of powers of 5. But the key is that if we look for a fixed m, then:\n\n     Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n     Let R(m) be the largest n such that f(n) < m+1.\n\n   Then the numbers n for which f(n)=m are the numbers from L(m) to R(m)-1? Actually, wait:\n\n   We want f(n)=m. So we need the smallest n0 such that f(n0)=m, and then the largest n1 such that f(n1)=m, and then all n in [n0, n1] will have f(n)=m?\n\n   But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing, so if we define:\n\n      L(m) = min { n : f(n) >= m } \n      R(m) = min { n : f(n) >= m+1 }\n\n   Then for any n in [L(m), R(m)-1], we have f(n) = m? Not exactly. Consider:\n\n      m=1: \n          L(1) = 5 (since f(5)=1)\n          R(1) = 10 (since f(10)=2, so the first n with >=2 is 10)\n\n      Then the numbers n from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\n   But what if we consider m=2?\n          f(10)=2, f(11)=2, f(12)=2, f(13)=2, f(14)=2, f(15)=2? Actually, wait: \n          f(15)= floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3 -> wait, that's not 2.\n\n      Actually, let me compute:\n        n=10: 10//5 + 10//25 = 2+0=2\n        n=11: same as 10 -> 2\n        n=12: same -> 2\n        n=13: same -> 2\n        n=14: same -> 2\n        n=15: 15//5 + 15//25 + 15//125 = 3+0+0=3\n\n      So the numbers for m=2 are from 10 to 14.\n\n      Now, how do we get the boundaries?\n\n      We can use binary search to find:\n\n        Lower bound for m: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Upper bound for m: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n      Then the set of n with f(n)=m is [lower_bound, upper_bound - 1] (if the lower_bound exists and upper_bound is found).\n\n      However, note that there might be cases where no n has exactly m zeros? Actually, the function f(n) is defined",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is primarily governed by the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( L \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\), and the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( R \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\), inclusive. If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( R \\) is not found or \\( L \\) is not less than \\( R \\)), then there are no solutions.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The function \\( Z(n) \\) grows logarithmically with \\( n \\). Using binary search ensures that we efficiently locate the bounds \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) without resorting to a linear scan, which would be computationally expensive for large \\( m \\) values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while n >= divisor:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    left_bound = None\n    right_bound = None\n    \n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m + 100000\n    while lo <= hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros >= m:\n            left_bound = mid\n            hi = mid - 1\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n            \n    if left_bound is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    lo2 = left_bound + 1\n    hi2 = 10**15\n    while lo2 <= hi2:\n        mid2 = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        zeros2 = count_trailing_zeros(mid2)\n        if zeros2 >= m + 1:\n            right_bound = mid2\n            hi2 = mid2 - 1\n        else:\n            lo2 = mid2 + 1\n            \n    if right_bound is None:\n        k = 0\n    else:\n        k = right_bound - left_bound\n        if k == 0:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        start = left_bound\n        end = right_bound - 1\n        res = []\n        for i in range(start, end + 1):\n            res.append(str(i))\n        print(\" \".join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **main()**: The main function reads the input value \\( m \\) and performs binary searches to find the lower bound \\( L \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with at least \\( m \\) trailing zeros) and the upper bound \\( R \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with at least \\( m+1 \\) trailing zeros). \n\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: The initial binary search for \\( L \\) starts between 0 and a sufficiently large upper bound (5*m + 100000). The second binary search for \\( R \\) starts from \\( L + 1 \\) up to a very large number (10^15) to ensure coverage even for large \\( m \\) values.\n\n4. **Output Handling**: After determining the bounds \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), the code checks if there are any valid \\( n \\) values. If \\( R \\) is found, it prints the count of such \\( n \\) values followed by the values themselves in increasing order. If no such \\( n \\) exists, it simply outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging the properties of the trailing zero count function to handle large input sizes effectively.",
