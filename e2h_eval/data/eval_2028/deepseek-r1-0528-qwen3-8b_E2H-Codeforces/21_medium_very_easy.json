The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (odd/even) of the numbers because the condition is: \n a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2) which means one must be odd and the other even.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes: \n        odd_chests = number of chests with odd a_i\n        even_chests = number of chests with even a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n\n So, the maximum matching is limited by two independent bipartite graphs:\n   Graph1: odd_chests (left) and even_keys (right)\n   Graph2: even_chests (left) and odd_keys (right)\n\n However, we cannot use the same key twice. But note: the two graphs are independent because:\n   - The condition for odd_chest requires even key and for even_chest requires odd key.\n\n So, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n   min(odd_chests, even_keys)   [from the first graph] \n   + min(even_chests, odd_keys) [from the second graph]\n\n But wait, what if there are more than enough keys in one category? Then we are limited by the smaller of the two.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n        odd_chests: 9,11 -> 2\n        even_chests: 14,6,2 -> 3\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n        even_keys: 8,4,20 -> 3\n        odd_keys: 7 -> 1\n\n   Then: \n        From odd_chests and even_keys: min(2, 3) = 2\n        From even_chests and odd_keys: min(3, 1) = 1\n        Total = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n Another example: \n   \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n   Then: min(0,0)=0 from odd_chests and even_keys; min(5,1)=1 from even_chests and odd_keys -> total=1\n\n Example 3:\n   \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n   Then: min(0,4)=0 and min(1,0)=0 -> total=0.\n\n However, let's check the condition: \n   Condition for chest 10 (even) to be opened by a key: we need an odd key. But there are no odd keys. So 0.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n Step 1: Read n, m.\n Step 2: Read the list of chests and count odd_chests and even_chests.\n Step 3: Read the list of keys and count odd_keys and even_keys.\n\n Step 4: Calculate:\n        part1 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n        part2 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n        answer = part1 + part2\n\n Print the answer.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The condition for a valid match is that the chest's number and the key's number must have different parities (one even and one odd).\n2. **Intuition**: Separate the chests and keys into two categories based on their parity. Chestes with even numbers can only be opened by keys with odd numbers, and vice versa. The solution involves finding the maximum possible matches between these two independent sets.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n     - The minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys (matches for odd chests requiring even keys).\n     - The minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys (matches for even chests requiring odd keys).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    odd_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            odd_chests += 1\n    even_chests = n - odd_chests\n    \n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            odd_keys += 1\n    even_keys = m - odd_keys\n    \n    part1 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    part2 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    \n    print(part1 + part2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are odd or even. This helps in determining the valid pairs for opening chests.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering two separate scenarios:\n   - Opening odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys.\n   - Opening even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of the maximum matches from both scenarios gives the answer, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
