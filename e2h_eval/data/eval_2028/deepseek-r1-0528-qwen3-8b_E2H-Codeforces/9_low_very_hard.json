Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100000 items, each with weight either 1, 2, or 3, and a cost (which can be up to 10^9). We have a maximum total weight m (up to 300000).\n\n Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, we can categorize the souvenirs by their weight.\n\n Let:\n   type1 = list of costs for weight 1\n   type2 = list of costs for weight 2\n   type3 = list of costs for weight 3\n\n Then, we can sort each type in descending order (so that we can pick the most expensive ones first).\n\n Now, note that the total weight is the sum of the weights of the chosen items. We are allowed to use at most m weight.\n\n We can think of it as: we will choose some number of items from type1, type2, type3. Let:\n   x1 = number of type1 chosen (each 1)\n   x2 = number of type2 chosen (each 2)\n   x3 = number of type3 chosen (each 3)\n\n Then, the total weight is: w = x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 <= m\n And the total cost is: c = sum(type1[0:x1]) + sum(type2[0:x2]) + sum(type3[0:x3])\n\n However, iterating over all x1, x2, x3 is too expensive because n can be 100000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can use dynamic programming, but the state space is too large (m up to 300000, and three types). However, note that the weights are small (only 1,2,3) so we can do:\n\n Step 1: Precompute prefix sums for each type.\n\n For type1: sort in descending order and compute prefix sums: \n   prefix1[i] = sum of the first i items (i from 0 to count1)\n\n Similarly for type2 and type3.\n\n Then, we can consider that we are going to use at most floor(m/3) of type3, then the remaining weight is m - 3*x3, which we use for type1 and type2.\n\n But note: we can also interleave the choices. Alternatively, we can iterate over the number of type3 items and then solve the two-item problem for the remaining weight and types1 and type2.\n\n However, the two-item problem (with weights 1 and 2) is still a knapSack variant. But note: we have two types: one with weight 1 and one with weight 2, and we want to maximize the total cost without exceeding the remaining weight.\n\n But note: we have two arrays for type1 and type2 (both sorted in descending order). We can precompute for the two-item problem the maximum total cost for a given remaining weight W (which is m - 3*x3) by combining type1 and type2.\n\n However, the remaining weight W can be up to 300000, and we cannot iterate for each x3 from 0 to about W//3 and then for each possible split of W between type1 and type2 (which would be O(W) per x3, and W can be 300000, then total operations would be O(300000 * (300000/3)) which is too high).\n\n Instead, we can precompute an array dp2[W'] for the two-item problem (using type1 and type2) for W' from 0 to m (or maybe up to 300000). How to compute dp2?\n\n Alternatively, we can combine the two types as:\n\n   Let A = sorted(type1, reverse=True)   -> but we don't need the entire array, we just need the best k items from type1 (for k from 0 to len(type1))\n   Similarly for type2.\n\n But note: we can use unbounded knapSack style? Actually, we are limited by the available items.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let's create an array `dp` for the two-item problem (weight 1 and 2) for capacity up to m (or up to the maximum remaining weight, which is m).\n\n However, note: we are going to use the two-item problem for capacities from 0 to m, but then we subtract 3*x3 from m, so we need the two-item solution for capacity up to m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the prefix sums for type1 and type2 (for each type, we have the best k items for k from 0 to the number of items in that type).\n\n 2. Precompute an array `dp2` for the two-item problem",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs have weights of either 1, 2, or 3 units, and each has a corresponding cost. The challenge is to select a subset of these souvenirs such that their total weight is at most `m` and their total cost is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three categories based on their weights (1, 2, or 3). Each category will contain the costs of souvenirs with the respective weight.\n2. **Sort and Prefix Sums**: For each category, sort the costs in descending order and compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly access the sum of the top `k` items in any category.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Type 3 Items**: Since the weight of type 3 items is 3, we consider all possible numbers of type 3 items (from 0 to the maximum possible, which is `m // 3`). For each number of type 3 items, we calculate the remaining weight available for type 1 and type 2 items.\n4. **Two-Item Knapsack Problem**: For the remaining weight, we need to maximize the cost from type 1 and type 2 items. This is done by iterating over possible combinations of type 1 and type 2 items, using their prefix sums to efficiently compute the maximum cost.\n5. **Maximize Total Cost**: For each combination of type 3 items and the corresponding optimal selection of type 1 and type 2 items, compute the total cost and keep track of the maximum value encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    index = 2\n    type1 = []\n    type2 = []\n    type3 = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        w = int(data[index])\n        c = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            type1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            type2.append(c)\n        elif w == 3:\n            type3.append(c)\n            \n    type1.sort(reverse=True)\n    type2.sort(reverse=True)\n    type3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    def get_prefix(arr):\n        arr.sort(reverse=True)\n        prefix = [0]\n        total = 0\n        for num in arr:\n            total += num\n            prefix.append(total)\n        return prefix\n\n    prefix1 = get_prefix(type1)\n    prefix2 = get_prefix(type2)\n    prefix3 = get_prefix(type3)\n    \n    max_weight = m\n    \n    best = 0\n    \n    count1 = len(type1)\n    count2 = len(type2)\n    count3 = len(type3)\n    \n    for x3 in range(0, min(count3, max_weight // 3) + 1):\n        rem = max_weight - 3 * x3\n        if rem < 0:\n            break\n            \n        total_cost_type3 = prefix3[x3]\n        current_best = total_cost_type3\n        \n        w_rem = rem\n        \n        x2_max = min(count2, w_rem // 2)\n        x1_remaining = w_rem - 2 * x2_max\n        \n        x2_max_possible = min(count2, x2_max)\n        x1_max_possible = min(count1, x1_remaining)\n        \n        best1 = 0\n        best2 = 0\n        \n        if x1_remaining >= 0 and x1_remaining <= count1:\n            best1 = prefix1[x1_remaining]\n        \n        if x2_max_possible >= 0 and x2_max_possible <= count2:\n            best2 = prefix2[x2_max_possible]\n        \n        candidate = best1 + best2 + total_cost_type3\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n        x2 = 0\n        while x2 <= x2_max_possible:\n            rem_after_x2 = w_rem - 2 * x2\n            if rem_after_x2 < 0:\n                break\n                \n            x1_here = min(count1, rem_after_x2)\n            total_here = prefix1[x1_here] + prefix2[x2]\n            if total_here > best - total_cost_type3:\n                best = total_here + total_cost_type3\n                \n            x2 += 1\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of souvenirs `n` and the maximum weight `m`. The souvenirs are then categorized based on their weights into three lists: `type1`, `type2`, and `type3`.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each category's list of costs is sorted in descending order, and prefix sums are computed to facilitate quick summation of the top `k` items.\n3. **Iterating Over Type 3 Items**: For each possible count of type 3 items (from 0 to the maximum feasible count), the remaining weight is calculated. The total cost from these type 3 items is added to the best cost tracker.\n4. **Handling Remaining Weight**: The remaining weight is used to select the best combination of type 1 and type 2 items. This involves checking all feasible counts of type 2 items and using the prefix sums to find the optimal type 1 items that fit the remaining weight.\n5. **Tracking Maximum Cost**: The maximum cost encountered during the iteration is printed as the result, ensuring the solution adheres to the weight constraint while maximizing the total cost.",
