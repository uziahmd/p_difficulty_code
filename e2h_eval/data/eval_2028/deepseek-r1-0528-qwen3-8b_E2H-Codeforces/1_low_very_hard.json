The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners that were double counted? Actually, the standard formula for the border of an n x m grid is 2*(n+m-2) for the inner part? Let me think differently.\n\n Alternatively, note that the ring is the set of cells that are at the border of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size n x m is:\n   If n==1 or m==1, then it's just n*m (but our rectangles are at least 3x3 initially, and then decreasing by multiples of 4). However, we are told that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3 (if k>=1, then the first ring uses w and h, then the next uses w-4 and h-4, etc.)\n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: 3 3 1 -> Output: 8\n   The border of a 3x3 grid: \n        3x3 has 8 cells (all except the center) -> correct.\n\n How to compute the border of a rectangle of size n x m?\n   The border has two horizontal sides: each of length n, but actually the top and bottom have n cells, and the left and right have m-2 cells (because the top and bottom already included the corners).\n   So total = 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n However, note the problem defines the rings as starting from the outer edge and then moving inward. But wait, the example input '7 9 1' gives 28.\n\n Let me compute for 7x9:\n   Using the formula above: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Now, what about two rings? Example: 7 9 2 -> 40.\n\n For the first ring (i=1): \n        rectangle = 7x9 -> border = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 28.\n\n For the second ring (i=2): \n        rectangle = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Then the border of 3x5 = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12.\n\n Then total gilded cells = 28 + 12 = 40.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second goes 2 cells away. But note that the second ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(2-1))x(h-4*(2-1)) = (w-4)x(h-4). And then we take the border of that. But is there any overlap?\n\n The rings are non-overlapping because the second ring is drawn on the inside of the first, and they don't share any cell. The first ring covers the outermost layer, the second ring covers the next outermost layer (which is 2 cells away from the original edge, meaning the first ring's inner side is adjacent to the second ring's outer side? Actually, no: the second ring is drawn on the inner rectangle, which is 3x5, and the border of that 3x5 is independent.\n\n Therefore, the total number of cells is the sum for i from 1 to k of the border of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)).\n\n But note: we must ensure that the rectangle for the i-th ring is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the outer edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one. Each ring has a width of one cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring's border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners. For a rectangle of size \\( n \\times m \\), the number of cells in its border is \\( 2n + 2m - 4 \\). This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the top and bottom rows (each of size \\( n \\)) and the left and right columns (each of size \\( m-2 \\)).\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to \\( k \\), compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by reducing both the width and height by \\( 4(i-1) \\), where \\( i \\) is the ring number. Then, apply the border formula to find the number of cells in that ring's border. Sum these values across all \\( k \\) rings to get the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\( O(k) \\), which is efficient given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        n = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        m = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2 * n + 2 * m - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: \\( w \\) (width), \\( h \\) (height), and \\( k \\) (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\( k \\), adjust the dimensions of the rectangle by subtracting \\( 4(i-1) \\) from both width and height. This adjustment accounts for the inward movement of each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Border Cells**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the number of border cells using the formula \\( 2n + 2m - 4 \\). This formula efficiently counts all cells on the perimeter without double-counting the four corners.\n4. **Summing Results**: Accumulate the border cells for all rings into a total sum.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and handling each ring independently, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
