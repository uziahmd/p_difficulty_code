    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring consists of the bordering cells (with width 1). \n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But observe: \n   For the first ring (i=1): \n        The rectangle is w x h, and the ring is the border (which has 2*w + 2*h - 4 because the corners are counted twice if we do 2*(w+h) and then subtract the 4 corners we double-counted? Actually, the border of an a x b grid has 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, wait: the example input '3 3 1' gives 8. \n        For a 3x3 grid: \n          2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n But for the next example: '7 9 1'\n        Using the same formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Then for the third example: '7 9 2'\n        First ring (i=1): uses the entire 7x9, so we have a rectangle of 7x9. The border for this ring: 2*7+2*9-4 = 28.\n        Second ring (i=2): uses the inner rectangle of size (7-4*1) x (9-4*1) = 3x5. Then the border of this 3x5: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n However, note the condition for k: \n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n This condition ensures that we don't try to draw a ring that would have negative or zero dimensions.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n So for the second ring, the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). And the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n Therefore, the total number of cells is the sum for i from 1 to k of [2*(w - 4*(i-1)) + 2*(h - 4*(i-1)) - 4]\n\n Simplify: \n        For ring i, let s_i = (w - 4*(i-1)) and t_i = (h - 4*(i-1))\n        Then the number of cells in ring i is: 2*s_i + 2*t_i - 4 = 2*(s_i + t_i) - 4\n\n However, note that the ring must be non-negative. The condition on k ensures that for i from 1 to k, the dimensions are at least 1 (since the smallest rectangle we consider for the last ring must have positive dimensions). \n\n But wait, the formula for the border requires that the rectangle has at least 2x2 (so that the border is non-empty). Actually, if the rectangle is 1x1, then the border is just that single cell? However, the problem says each ring has width 1 cell. And the definition is: \"all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\". \n\n In fact, if the inner rectangle is 1x1, then the border would be that single cell. But note that the problem's example condition: \n        k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4)\n\n Let's check for a 3x3: min(3,3)=3 -> (3+1)//4 = 4//4 = 1 -> so k=1 is allowed. But what if k=2 for 3x3?\n        Then the second ring would use a rectangle of (3-4*1)= -1, which is invalid. So the condition prevents that.\n\n However, the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we don't need to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n Steps:\n        Read w, h, k.\n        Initialize total = 0.\n        For i in range(1, k+1):\n            Let w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            Let h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            Then the number of cells for this ring is 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4.\n\n        Print total.\n\n But wait: what if the rectangle becomes too small? The condition on k ensures that for the k-th ring, w_i and h_i are at least 1? Actually, let's check:\n\n        Condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n        For example, w=3, h=3: min=3 -> floor((3+1)/4)=1, so k=1 is maximum.\n\n        Another example: w=5, h=5: min=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=6//4=1 (since 6//4=1 in integer division). Then k=1 only.\n\n        But wait, let me recalculate: the condition says k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For 5x5, we can have up to 1 ring? \n\n        However, the rings are drawn as: \n            Ring1: outer rectangle 5x5 -> border: 2*5+2*5-4 = 16.\n            Then Ring2 would require: w_i = 5-4=1, h_i=5-4=1 -> then the border of 1x1: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0. So we cannot have two rings.\n\n        The condition was: floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) = floor((5+1)/4)=1.5 -> floor(1.5)=1. So k=1 is maximum.\n\n        But what if we have w=7, h=9: \n            min=7 -> (7+1)//4 = 8//4 = 2. So k=2 is allowed.\n\n        So the condition is correct.\n\n However, note: the condition is defined as: \n        k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4)   [here n and m are w and h]\n\n So our code must read k from input and we know k is within the bounds.\n\n But note: the problem says the plate has dimensions w x h, and k is given and satisfies the condition.\n\n Therefore, we can safely iterate from i=1 to k.\n\n However, there is a catch: if the current rectangle (w_i x h_i) is too small, the formula might break? But the condition ensures that the last ring (k-th) has nonnegative dimensions, but what about intermediate ones? \n\n Actually, the condition ensures that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Let me see:\n\n        Let m = min(w, h)\n        Then the last ring (k-th) requires: \n            w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= 1   [at least one cell]?\n            Similarly, h_k = h - 4*(k-1) >= 1?\n\n        The condition: k <= floor((m+1)/4) => 4*k <= m+1 => 4*(k-1) <= m+1 - 4 = m-3.\n\n        But we need w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= 1 and h_k = h - 4*(k-1) >= 1.\n\n        Since m = min(w, h), then the minimum dimension of the original plate is m, and we subtract 4*(k-1) from both, so the minimum dimension after k-1 steps is m - 4*(k-1) >= ?\n\n        From the condition: 4*k <= m+1  => 4*(k-1) <= m+1 - 4 = m-3, so m - 4*(k-1) >= m - (m-3) = 3. \n\n        Actually, wait: \n            Condition: k <= (m+1)//4   (integer floor division)\n\n            Then 4*k <= m+1   (if we think in real numbers, then floor((m+1)/4) is the largest integer k such that 4*k <= m+1)\n\n            Then 4*(k-1) <= m+1 - 4 = m-3.\n\n            Then the minimum dimension after k-1 steps is m - 4*(k-1) >= m - (m-3) = 3? \n\n        Actually, we don't know if w and h are equal. But note: we subtract 4*(k-1) from both, so the minimum dimension after k-1 steps is min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= m - (m-3) = 3? \n\n        But wait: from 4*(k-1) <= m-3, then subtracting from m: m - 4*(k-1) >= 3.\n\n        So the smallest side of the rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3, meaning the k-th ring is defined for a rectangle of at least 3x? (but actually, the k-th ring is built from a rectangle of size (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)) which has minimum side 3, so the border is well-defined (at least 3x3: which gives 8 cells).\n\n        However, note that the k-th ring is built from the rectangle (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)), and we don't use the next ring. But the condition only restricts k to be <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        But what about the intermediate rings? They have more cells. The condition only ensures that the k-th ring is valid. But note: the condition is defined with the original w and h, and k must satisfy that. The intermediate rings (for i from 1 to k-1) will have larger rectangles, so they are also valid (because the condition for a ring i is that the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)) must have positive dimensions? Actually, the condition doesn't explicitly say, but since k is the maximum, then for i<k, the rectangle is even larger so it's definitely valid.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply compute for i from 1 to k.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=2.\n        i=1: w1=7, h1=9 -> cells1 = 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n        i=2: w2=7-4=3, h2=9-4=5 -> cells2 = 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 40.\n\n Code:\n\n        Read the input: one line with three integers.\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # For the (i+1)-th ring\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            # But wait: the problem says the i-th ring (starting at 1) uses (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). \n            # So for the first ring, i=0 -> subtract 0, for the second ring, i=1 -> subtract 4, etc.\n            # So we can adjust the loop index: if we let i from 0 to k-1, then the ring number is i+1, and we subtract 4*i (because (i+1)-1 = i).\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # Actually, the above calculation is for the (i+1)-th ring: \n            #   ring number = i+1, then subtract 4*(i) from both.\n\n            # But note: the problem says: \n            #   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1))\"\n            #   So for i-th ring, subtract 4*(i-1). \n\n            # We can do:\n\n            # Option 1: loop from i=1 to k, then subtract 4*(i-1)\n            # Option 2: loop from i=0 to k-1, then subtract 4*i for the (i+1)-th ring.\n\n            # Both are equivalent.\n\n            # Let's use option 1: we change the loop to go from 1 to k.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            #   for i in range(1, k+1):\n            #       w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            #       h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            #       ring_cells = 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4\n\n            # But the example above used the same.\n\n        However, the above two methods are the same. \n\n        Let me write the code with the loop from 1 to k.\n\n        But note: k can be 0? The problem says k>=1.\n\n        So:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if w_i < 2 or h_i < 2:\n                # According to the problem condition, this shouldn't happen, but just to be safe?\n                # Actually, the condition on k ensures that the last ring has w_i>=1 and h_i>=1, but note: \n                #   The border formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 requires that the rectangle has at least 2x2 to have a border (if 1x1 then 0, if 1x2 then 2*1+2*2-4 = 2+4-4=2, but wait: the border of a 1x2: \n                #   The border is the entire 1x2? Actually, no: the border of a 1x2 is the two cells? But the problem defines the ring as the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. \n                #   However, the problem says the ring has width 1. For a 1x2, the border would be the entire thing? But the problem says \"all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\", meaning the outer layer. \n                #   But the condition says k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we never get a negative dimension, but we might get a 1x something? \n\n                # Let's check: \n                #   Condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n                #   For a 1x? : but w,h>=3 initially, and we subtract 4*(i-1). \n\n                # Actually, the condition ensures that the minimum dimension of the original plate is at least 4*(k-1)+1, so the k-th ring has at least 1x1, but wait: \n                #   We require the ring to be drawn only if the inner rectangle is at least 1x1, but the border of a 1x1 is 1 cell? \n                #   However, the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. For a 3x3, the first ring is 8 cells. \n\n                # But the formula for the border: 2*w_i+2*h_i-4, for 1x1: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0. That doesn't match.\n\n                # Actually, the border of a 1x1 is the entire cell. But according to the problem, the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n                # The problem says: \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\", meaning that the ring is one cell thick. \n\n                # How is the border defined for a 1x1? \n                #   The border of a 1x1 is the entire cell. But then the number of cells is 1.\n\n                # Similarly, for a 1x2: \n                #   The border: the top and bottom rows (each row has 1 cell) and the sides? But wait, the sides are not full because the height is 1. \n                #   Actually, the border of a 1x2 is the entire 1x2 (both cells) because the top and bottom are the same row, and the left and right are the two columns.\n\n                # However, the formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 is designed for a rectangle that is at least 2x2. \n\n                # But the problem condition ensures that the k-th ring has a rectangle of at least 1x1. \n\n                # Let me reexamine the condition: \n                #   k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n                # Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: \n                #   Then the first ring: 3x3 -> 8 cells, which is correct.\n\n                # Now, if we have w=4, h=4, then min=4 -> floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1. So k=1 is maximum.\n                #   Then the ring: 4x4 -> border: 2*4+2*4-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n                # But wait, the inner rectangle for the first ring is 4x4? Actually, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. \n                #   The edge of a 4x4: \n                #       top row: 4 cells\n                #       bottom row: 4 cells\n                #       middle two rows: each has 2 cells (excluding the edges) -> but wait, the entire border: \n                #           top: 4, bottom:4, left: two cells (from row1 to row3) and right: two cells (from row1 to row3). \n                #           Actually, the standard way: the border of a 4x4 is 2*4+2*4-4 = 12, and indeed: \n                #           top: 4, bottom:4, left: 2 (rows 1 and 3, excluding the corners already counted) and right: 2 -> 4+4+2+2 = 12.\n\n                # Now, if we have a 1x1: \n                #   According to the problem, k<=floor((1+1)/4)=floor(2/4)=0, so k=0 is the maximum. But k>=1 per input, so we don't have to consider.\n\n                # So the condition ensures that we never get a rectangle of 0x0, and the smallest we get is 1x1 for the k-th ring? \n\n                # But wait, the condition is defined with the original w and h. \n\n                # Actually, the condition is: \n                #   k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n                # For a 3x3, k=1 is allowed. The first ring uses 3x3. Then the next ring would use (3-4)= -1, so k=1 is the maximum.\n\n                # For a 4x4, k=1 is allowed. The next ring would use (4-4)=0, so invalid.\n\n                # For a 5x5: floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=1 is allowed. Then the next ring would use 1x1, but wait: the condition doesn't say anything about intermediate rings? \n\n                # Actually, the condition is defined for the original w and h, and the problem says k is at most that value. \n\n                # But note: the k-th ring is built from the (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)) rectangle. \n\n                # The condition ensures that the k-th ring is built from a rectangle that has at least one cell (because w-4*(k-1) >= 1 and h-4*(k-1)>=1). \n\n                # However, the border formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 is valid for any w_i>=2 and h_i>=2? \n\n                # Actually, the border formula is derived for a rectangle that has at least 2x2. For a 1x1: \n                #   The border is the entire cell, so 1 cell. But the formula gives 0. \n\n                # For a 1x2: \n                #   The border: we have two cells.

So we don't need the first condition.\n\n        Actually, the border of a rectangle a x b is:\n            if a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n            elif a == 1 or b == 1: a*b   (because the entire rectangle is the border)\n            else: 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But note: when a==1 and b==2, we get 1*2=2, which is correct.\n\n        However, the problem condition ensures that the k-th ring is built from a rectangle of at least 1x1, but what about the intermediate rings? \n\n        The intermediate rings have larger rectangles, so if the k-th ring is 1x1, then the (k-1)-th ring must be at least 5x5? \n\n        Actually, the condition is defined for the original w and h, and the k-th ring is the one that subtracts 4*(k-1). \n\n        Since k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), the k-th ring has dimensions (w-4*(k-1)) and (h-4*(k-1)) which are at least 1 (as per the condition). \n\n        However, we must compute the border for every ring, not just the last one.\n\n        So we need a general function:\n\n            def border(a, b):\n                if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                    return 0\n                if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                    return 1\n                if a == 1 or b == 1:\n                    return a * b\n                return 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        But wait, the condition in the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, and k>=1, and the rings are drawn by reducing the dimensions by multiples of 4. \n\n        However, we are given that the input w, h are at least 3.\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n            Example1: w=3, h=3, k=1.\n                a=3, b=3 -> else: 2*3+2*3-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n            Example2: w=7, h=9, k=1 -> 2*7+2*9-4=28; k=2: a=3, b=5 -> 3>=2 and 5>=2 -> 2*3+2*5-4=12.\n\n            Example3: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> 8.\n\n            Example4: w=4, h=4, k=1 -> 2*4+2*4-4=12.\n\n            Example5: w=5, h=5, k=1 -> 2*5+2*5-4=16.\n\n            Example6: w=1, h=1, k=1 -> but the input condition says w,h>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, the condition on k for w=3, h=3 is k<=1, so k=1 is the maximum.\n\n        But what if we have w=5, h=5, and k=1: \n            Then the ring is 5x5 -> border: 2*5+2*5-4=16.\n\n        Now, what if we have w=6, h=6, k=1: 2*6+2*6-4=20.\n        k=2: because floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1, so k=2 is not allowed. So k=1 is maximum.\n\n        Now, let me check: w=8, h=8, then floor((8+1)/4)=floor(9/4)=2 -> so k=2 is allowed.\n\n            Ring1: 8x8 -> border: 2*8+2*8-4=28.\n            Ring2: 8-4*1=4, 8-4*1=4 -> 4x4: border=2*4+2*4-4=12.\n\n            Total=40.\n\n        Now, what if we have w=2, h=2? The input condition says w,h>=3, so skip.\n\n        But wait, the problem says w,h>=3.\n\n        However, the condition on k is defined as: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        Since w,h>=3, the minimum value for floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) is floor((3+1)/4)=1.\n\n        So k>=1 and k<=1 for w=h=3.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the function:\n\n            def border(a, b):\n                if a < 1 or b < 1:\n                    return 0\n                if a == 1 and b == 1:\n                    return 1\n                if a == 1 or b == 1:\n                    return a * b\n                return 2*a + 2*b - 4\n\n        Then for each ring i (from 1 to k):\n            a = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b = h - 4*(i-1)\n            total += border(a, b)\n\n        But note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, and k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        However, we must consider that the condition on k ensures that the rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1, but the intermediate rings are larger. \n\n        But the intermediate rings might be 1x? or ?x1? \n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: \n            First ring: 7x9 -> 28\n            Second ring: 3x5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=12.\n\n        But what if w=7, h=5? Then min=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=1 only. Then the first ring: 7x5 -> 2*7+2*5-4=14+10-4=20.\n\n        Now, what if w=1, h=1? Not allowed by input.\n\n        We can rely on the input constraints.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the plate is w x h, and we are given w, h, k.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                a = w - 4*i\n                b = h - 4*i\n                # But wait, in the problem, the i-th ring (i starting at 1) subtracts 4*(i-1). \n                # In our loop, if we let i from 0 to k-1, then the ring index is i+1, and we subtract 4*i (because (i+1)-1 = i). \n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                #   for i in range(k):\n                #       a = w - 4*i\n                #       b = h - 4*i\n\n                #   Then for the first ring (i=0): subtract 0, for the second ring (i=1): subtract 4.\n\n                # This matches the problem.\n\n            Then use the border function.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the i-th ring (i starting at 1) is built from (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n        Our loop index i (from 0 to k-1) corresponds to subtracting 4*i, which is 4*(i) = 4*(ring_index-1). \n\n        So yes, that matches.\n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2, then:\n            i=0: a=7, b=9 -> border(7,9)=2*7+2*9-4=28.\n            i=1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its position relative to the edge of the plate, with each subsequent ring being two cells away from the previous one. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings. Each ring `i` (1-based index) is formed by the border of a rectangle that is smaller than the original plate by `4*(i-1)` cells in both dimensions. The border of a rectangle `a x b` is calculated as follows:\n   - If either dimension is 1, the entire rectangle is considered the border.\n   - Otherwise, the border is calculated using the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`, which accounts for the four edges minus the four corners counted twice.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are derived by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original width and height. The border of this rectangle is then computed based on its dimensions. The sum of these borders for all `k` rings gives the total number of gilded cells.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and use the border calculation function to determine the number of cells for each ring. Sum these values to get the final result.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where `k` is the number of rings. Since `k` is constrained by the input dimensions (up to floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4), this approach is efficient even for the upper limits of the input constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    def border(a, b):\n        if a < 1 or b < 1:\n            return 0\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            return 1\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            return a * b\n        return 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        total += border(a, b)\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Border Calculation Function**: The `border` function computes the number of cells in the border of a rectangle `a x b`. If either dimension is 1, it returns the product of the dimensions (the entire rectangle). Otherwise, it uses the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4` for rectangles larger than 1x1.\n3. **Iterating Over Rings**: For each ring from 0 to `k-1`, the code calculates the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*i` from both `w` and `h`. The border cells for each rectangle are added to the total.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring correctness for all valid input ranges.",
