При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string t (the received message) and we need to check if it is the result of two identical messages s being sent with an error.\n Conditions:\n - The entire message t must be formed by overlapping two copies of some string s.\n - The overlap must be positive and less than the length of s. However, note that the problem states that if the entire message is just two copies without any non-overlapping part, then there was no error (so we output 'NO' for that).\n - But note: the example says if the message is \"abcabc\", then there is no error. Why? Because we can split it as \"abc\" and \"abc\", but the overlap condition requires that the overlap is positive and less than the length of s. Here, if we take s = \"abc\", then the overlap would be 3 (the entire second s is overlapped). Since the problem says the overlap must be less than the length of s, then this is not allowed? Actually, wait: the problem says \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\". So the entire message \"abcabc\" cannot be explained by an error because the overlap would have to be 3, which is not less than the length of s (which is 3). Therefore, we must look for a split where the two parts are equal and the overlap is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> Output: YES, s = \"abrakadabra\"\n   Explanation: We split into \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\", and the overlap is 1 (the first character 'a' of the second part overlaps with the last character 'a' of the first part). This is valid because 1 < 11.\n\n Steps:\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are going to consider that the entire message t is formed by two copies of s, so we can write t = A + B, where A is the first part and B is the second part, and the second part starts at some index i (0 <= i < n) such that the suffix of the first part (from i to the end) is equal to the prefix of the second part (from 0 to ...).\n\n Actually, we can think: \n   Let s be the base string. Then we have two copies: the first copy is s, and the second copy is s but with an overlap of k (0 < k < len(s)). Then the total length is 2*len(s) - k = n.\n\n So, n = 2*k0 - k, but wait, actually the entire string is built as:\n   First part: s[0: len(s)]\n   Second part: s[k0:] (where k0 is the overlap, and k0 < len(s))\n\n Then the entire string is s + s[k0:]. And note that the length is len(s) + (len(s) - k0) = 2*len(s) - k0.\n\n Alternatively, we can also consider: \n   We have two strings s1 and s2, both equal to s, and they are overlapped by k0, so the total string is s1 + s2[k0:].\n\n But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical, so s1 = s2 = s.\n\n Condition: The entire string t must be s + s[k0:], and k0 must satisfy 0 < k0 < len(s).\n\n Also, the length condition: n = len(s) + (len(s) - k0) = 2*len(s) - k0.\n\n Therefore, k0 = 2*len(s) - n.\n\n But note: we don't know s. However, we can try to find a candidate s from the possible splits.\n\n Another approach: \n   We require that the entire string t can be split into two parts: a prefix and a suffix, and the suffix is a substring of the prefix (specifically, the last k0 characters of the prefix must equal the first k0 characters of the entire string, and the remaining part of the prefix must equal the remaining part of the suffix).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire string to be broken only at one point. We have:\n\n   t = s + s[k0:]\n\n But we don't know s. However, we can consider that the string t must have a period or something?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider all possible ways to split the string into two parts (without the error) and then check for an overlap.\n\n But note: the problem says that the error happens when two identical messages are sent and then they overlap. So the entire message t must be the concatenation of two copies of s with an overlap of k0 (0 < k0 < len(s)).\n\n How to check?\n   Let n = len(t)\n   We are going to consider: \n        Let s be a string such that t = s + s[k0:], and k0 = len(s) - x (but wait, we can also consider that the two copies are of length L, then the total length is 2*L - k0 = n, so L = (n + k0) / 2. But k0 is between 1 and L-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible lengths of s. Note that s must appear at least twice, so the length of s must be at most n//2 * 2? Actually, the total length n = 2*L - k0, and k0>=1, so 2*L - k0 <= 2*L - 1, and also n >= L+1 (because k0<=L-1, so n = 2*L - k0 >= 2*L - (L-1) = L+1). Also, since k0>=1, n <= 2*L-1.\n\n   Actually, we can set L (the length of s) such that:\n        L must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) ? Not exactly.\n\n   We know: n = 2*L - k0, with 1<=k0<=L-1.\n        => L = (n + k0) / 2, and k0 is between 1 and L-1.\n\n   Also, note that the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k0:].\n\n   We can try to consider the entire string and look for a split at position L (the first occurrence of s) and then check if the next part (of length n-L) is equal to s[k0:].\n\n   But note: we don't know L. However, we can express k0 = 2*L - n, and then we require that k0 is an integer and 0 < k0 < L.\n\n   Also, from n = 2*L - k0, we have L = (n + k0) / 2. Since k0 must be an integer, then n+k0 must be even? Actually, no: because we are defining k0 from L and n, but we are iterating on L.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the condition: the entire string t must be periodic with period L, but with an overlap of k0. Actually, we can note:\n\n        t[0:L] = s\n        t[L:] should be equal to s[k0:].\n\n        Also, the condition for the next part: the length of the second part is n - L, and that must be equal to L - k0, so n - L = L - k0 -> k0 = 2*L - n.\n\n   Therefore, for a candidate L (the length of s), we must have:\n        n - L = L - k0  => k0 = 2*L - n, and we require 0 < k0 < L.\n\n   Then, the conditions on L:\n        k0 = 2*L - n must be an integer between 1 and L-1.\n\n        So: 1 <= 2*L - n <= L-1\n\n        From 2*L - n <= L-1  => L <= n-1.\n        From 2*L - n >= 1    => L >= (n+1)//2 (if n is odd, then (n+1)//2 is integer; if n is even, then L >= (n+1)//2, but note: (n+1)//2 might not be integer, so we take ceiling? Actually, let's solve:\n\n        Condition: 1 <= 2*L - n <= L-1\n\n        Lower bound: 2*L - n >= 1  => L >= (n+1)/2.\n        Upper bound: 2*L - n <= L-1 => L <= n-1.\n\n   Also, note that the entire string must satisfy:\n        t[0:L] == s\n        t[L:] == s[k0:]   => t[L:] == s[2*L - n : ]\n\n   But note: s has length L, so s[2*L-n:] is a substring of s starting at index 2*L-n and of length L - (2*L-n) = n - L.\n\n   Therefore, we can iterate L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). For each L:\n        k0 = 2*L - n\n        Check that k0 is an integer (which it will be because n and L are integers) and 1 <= k0 <= L-1.\n\n        Then, check if t[0:L] + t[L:] == s + s[k0:]?\n        Actually, we have two parts: the first part is t[0:L] (which is s) and the second part is t[L:] (which should be s[k0:]). But note, s[k0:] has length L - k0, and the second part t[L:] has length n-L, and from our equation n-L = L - k0, so the lengths match.\n\n        Now, we can check: \n            s = t[0:L]\n            expected_second_part = s[k0:]\n            if t[L:] == expected_second_part, then we have found a candidate s.\n\n   Then, we can output \"YES\" and the candidate s.\n\n   But note: the problem says that if there are multiple possibilities, output any. Also, if we don't find any candidate, output \"NO\".\n\n   However, wait: what if the entire string t is just two copies without any error? Then we would output \"NO\", which matches the condition (because the error requires an overlap that is positive and less than the length, and if we tried L = n/2 (if n is even) then k0 = 2*(n/2) - n = 0, which is not allowed). So that case is excluded.\n\n   Example: t = \"abcabc\", n=6.\n        Possible L: from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(3.5)=4 to 5 (since n-1=5). \n        L=4: k0=2*4-6=2, which is between 1 and 3 (valid). Then s = t[0:4]=\"abca\", then expected_second_part = s[2:] = \"ca\", and t[4:] = \"bc\", which is not equal to \"ca\". -> fails.\n        L=5: k0=2*5-6=4, which is not less than 5 (wait, 4<5 -> valid). Then s = t[0:5]=\"abcab\", then expected_second_part = s[4:] = \"b\", and t[5:] = \"c\", which is not equal.\n\n        So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=21.\n        We are told that s = \"abrakadabra\" (length 11). Then L=11: \n            k0 = 2*11 - 21 = 1, which is between 1 and 10 (valid).\n            s = \"abrakadabra\"\n            expected_second_part = s[1:] = \"brakadabra\"\n            t[11:] = \"brakadabra\" -> matches.\n\n        So we output \"YES\\nabrakadabra\".\n\n   Example: t = \"acacacaca\", n=10.\n        We are told to output \"YES\\nacaca\".\n        Let's check: \n            Candidate s = \"acaca\" (length 5): \n                k0 = 2*5 - 10 = 0 -> invalid (must be at least 1). \n            Let me check other L.\n\n        Actually, note: the example output is \"acaca\", so the string t = \"acacacaca\" is built from two copies of \"acaca\" with an overlap of 5? But wait, the condition: k0 must be less than the length of s (5). So maximum k0 is 4.\n\n        How did they get it? \n            They split the string as:\n                s = \"acaca\", then the second copy should start with an overlap of 4: \n                    First copy: \"acaca\"\n                    Second copy: \"caca\" (the last 4 of the first copy is \"aca\", but wait, we are taking the entire second copy from the beginning of the second copy? Actually, the rule is: the entire string is s + s[k0:].\n\n            Then the total string would be \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is correct.\n\n            So for s=\"acaca\", k0=4, then the length condition: n = 5 + (5-4) = 6, but wait, our string has length 10.\n\n        Let me recalc: \n            The total length is 2*L - k0 = 2*5 - 4 = 6, but the given string has length 10.\n\n        There seems to be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Actually, note the example input includes: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n        And the output for 'acacacaca' is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"For example, when sending two messages 'abrakadabra' consecutively, it might be transmitted with an error, and then we get a message like 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra'.\"\n\n        In the example with \"acacacaca\", if we break it as two copies of \"acaca\", then we have:\n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: \"acaca\"\n\n        But then how is the error? The error occurs when two identical messages are sent and they overlap. The entire string is built as:\n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: we take the second copy and shift it by k0 (overlap) so that the last k0 characters of the first copy match the first k0 characters of the second copy.\n\n        But in the example, the entire string is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        How is that built? \n            If we take s = \"acaca\", then the total length would be 5 + (5 - k0) = 10 - k0. So k0 must be 5 - (10-5) ??? Wait, no: the total length is 5 + (5 - k0) = 10 - k0. We require 10 = 10 - k0 -> k0=0, which is invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example used a different s? \n\n        The example output says: \"acaca\". \n\n        Let me check the example: \n            Input: \"acacacaca\"\n\n        What if we take s = \"acaca\", and the error caused an overlap of 5? But the problem says the overlap must be less than the length of s (which is 5). So 5 is not allowed.\n\n        But note: the example output says \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning that the base string s is \"acaca\". \n\n        How did they build the string from s=\"acaca\"?\n            The entire string is s + s[overlap:], and the total length is 5 + (5 - overlap). We require 5+(5-overlap)=10, so overlap=0, which is invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the two messages are not of length 5? Maybe the base string is \"aca\", then two copies with an overlap of 2? \n            Then the total length would be 3 + (3-2)=4, but we have 10.\n\n        Or maybe the base string is \"acacaca\" (length 7)? Then k0 = 2*7 - 10 = 4, which is between 1 and 6. Then s = \"acacaca\", and the second part is s[4:] = \"ca\", and the total string would be \"acacaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example output says s=\"acaca\", not \"acacaca\".\n\n        Let me check the example again: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', ...]\n\n        And the output: \n            ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', ...]\n\n        So the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", not \"acacaca\".\n\n        How can \"acaca\" be the base string? \n\n        Let me break the string \"acacacaca\" as two copies of \"acaca\" with an error? \n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: \"acaca\"\n\n        But the error: we are supposed to have an overlap. How is the entire string built? \n            We have: \n                First copy: \"acaca\"\n                Second copy: we take the second copy and we allow an overlap of k0 (so we drop the first k0 characters of the second copy). \n\n            Then the entire string is: \"acaca\" + \"acaca\"[k0:]\n\n            We want the entire string to be \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n            The first copy is 5, so the second part must be 5 characters. Then k0 must be 5 - (5) = 0, which is not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the error model is different? The problem says: \"the two messages are identical\", so the base string is fixed. And the transmission error causes the second message to be shifted by k0, meaning that the first k0 characters of the second message are dropped (or rather, they are merged with the end of the first message). \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". So the entire string is: [first message] + [second message without the first k0 characters].\n\n        So the length of the entire string is: len(first message) + (len(second message) - k0) = 2*L - k0.\n\n        For the example \"acacacaca\", we have 10 = 2*L - k0, with 0 < k0 < L.\n\n        We are told that s = \"acaca\" (L=5) leads to 10 = 2*5 - k0 -> k0=0, which is invalid.\n\n        So how did the example work?\n\n        Let me check the sample outputs again: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        Another possibility: the base string s is not necessarily the same as the first part? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s.\"\n\n        And note: the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", meaning that the base string s is \"acaca\". \n\n        But with s=\"acaca\", the entire string is built as: s + s[k0:], and the length is 5 + (5-k0)=10-k0. We require 10=10-k0 -> k0=0, which is not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the error model allows the base string s to be chosen arbitrarily, but the entire string t must be decomposable as two copies of s with an overlap of k0 (0<k0<L). \n\n        We are not forced to take the first L characters as s. But note: the first copy is s and the second copy is s (the same). \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order of the two copies. But the example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is built from two copies of \"abrakadabra\": the first copy is \"abrakadabra\", and the second copy is \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1. \n\n        So the entire string is: \n            s[0:] + s[1:]\n\n        But wait, that would be \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is correct.\n\n        Now, for \"acacacaca\", if we let s = \"acaca\", then the entire string would be built as s + s[k0:] for some k0 (0<k0<5). \n\n        We need: s + s[k0:] = \"acacacaca\"\n\n        Let me try k0=1: \"acaca\" + \"cacaca\" -> \"accacacaca\" -> doesn't match.\n        k0=2: \"acaca\" + \"acaca\" -> \"acacacaca\" -> wait, that gives \"acacacaca\", which is the string.\n\n        Let me do it step by step for k0=2:\n            s = \"acaca\"\n            s[2:] = \"aca\"\n            Then the entire string is \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\" -> that's 7 characters, not 10.\n\n        Wait, I see: the entire string is built by the two copies: the first copy is s (full) and the second copy is s without the first k0 characters. So the total length is len(s) + (len(s) - k0) = 2*5 - 2 = 8, not 10.\n\n        But the example string is 10 characters.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow that the two copies are taken from the same s, but the entire string is built by having the two copies concatenated with the second copy starting at an offset (overlap) of k0, meaning that the second copy is inserted without the first k0 characters, but the first copy is the entire s. \n\n        Then the total length is indeed 2*L - k0.\n\n        For the example \"acacacaca\", we must have 2*L - k0 = 10, and 0<k0<L.\n\n        So 2*L - k0 = 10, and k0 = 2*L - 10.\n\n        Conditions: 1 <= 2*L - 10 <= L-1.\n\n        From 2*L - 10 >= 1 -> L>=5.5 -> L>=6.\n        From 2*L - 10 <= L-1 -> L<=9.\n\n        Then L can be 6,7,8,9.\n\n        Let's try L=6: k0=2*6-10=2, which is between 1 and 5. Then s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\", then the second part should be s[2:] = \"cac\", and the rest of the string is t[6:10]=\"acac\", which is not equal to \"cac\". -> fails.\n\n        L=7: k0=4, then s = t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then the second part is s[4:] = \"ca\", and the rest is t[7:10]=\"aca\", which is not equal to \"ca\". -> fails.\n\n        L=8: k0=6, then s = t[0:8]=\"acacacac\", then the second part is s[6:] = \"c\", and the rest is t[8:10]=\"ca\", which is not \"c\". -> fails.\n\n        L=9: k0=8, then s = t[0:9]=\"acacacaca\", then the second part is s[8:] = \"a\", and the rest is t[9:10]=\"a\", which matches.\n\n        Then we have a candidate: s=\"acacacaca\", and the entire string is built as s + s[8:] = \"acacacaca\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacaa\", but wait, that gives \"acacacacaa\", which is 10 characters? \n            Actually, the entire string is \"acacacacaa\", but the given string is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters: \n                \"acacacaca\" has 10 characters.\n\n            Our candidate s is \"acacacaca\", and then the entire string is built as s + s[8:] = \"acacacaca\" + \"a\" = \"acacacacaa\", which is 11 characters. That doesn't match.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the candidate L is that the entire string t must be s + s[k0:], and s is the first L characters. But note: the entire string t is given and of length n. \n\n        For candidate L, the first L characters are s, and the rest (n - L) characters must be s[k0:]. But we defined k0 = 2*L - n. Then the length of s[k0:] is L - k0, and we require that n - L = L - k0, so n = 2*L - k0.\n\n        In our example, for L=9, n=10, then k0=8, and the length of the rest of the string is 10-9=1, and the length of s[k0:] is 9-8=1, so the length matches. Then we check if t[9:] equals s[8:]. \n\n        t[9:] is the substring from index 9 to the end, which is one character: t[9] (0-indexed, and the string has indices 0 to 9). So t[9] is the 10th character (if we count from 1) but the string is 0-indexed: \n            t = \"acacacaca\"\n            t[0:9] = \"acacacac\" (if we take 9 characters, then index 8 is the last of the 9th, so the 9th character is the last of the 9-characters, and the 10th character is at index 9).\n\n        Actually, in Python, slicing: \n            t[0:9] gives the first 9 characters (from index0 to index8).\n            t[9:] gives the substring starting at index9, which is one character: the 10th.\n\n        So for L=9, we set s = t[0:9] = \"acacacac\" (the first 9 characters: \"a c a c a c a c\" -> 8 letters? Wait, no: the string \"acacacaca\" has 10 characters. \n\n        Let me write: \n            t = \"a c a c a c a c a c\" (10 characters)\n\n        Then t[0:9] = \"a c a c a c a c a\" (the first 9: indexes 0 to 8)\n        Then t[9:] = \"c\" (the 10th character)\n\n        And s[8:] is the substring from index8 to the end of s. s has length 9, so index8 is the 9th character of s (the last). \n        s = \"acacacac\" (9 characters: indices0..8) -> the 9th character is at index8, so s[8:] is the substring from index8 to the end: which is the last character of s, which is 'c'.\n\n        Then t[9:] is 'c', so it matches.\n\n        Then the base string s is \"acacacac\", but the example output says \"acaca\". \n\n        However, the problem says: if there are multiple possibilities, output any. \n\n        So we can output either \"acacacac\" (with L=9) or \"acaca\" (with L=5) if that were valid. But we saw that L=5 is not valid because then k0=0. \n\n        But wait, the example output is \"acaca\", so there must be a way to represent \"acacacaca\" as two copies of \"acaca\" with an error.\n\n        Let me reexamine the error model: \n            The problem says: \"the two messages are identical\", and the error merges the end of the first with the beginning of the second. \n\n            It does not say that the entire string is built by taking the first L characters as the base string and then the next part as the base string without the first k0. \n\n            Actually, the base string s is fixed, but the entire string t is built by writing s and then writing s[k0:].\n\n            However, the entire string might be broken differently. \n\n            Consider: \n                s = \"acaca\", then we can write the entire string as:\n                    t = s[0:5] + s[2:5]   -> but wait, that would be \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\", which is 7 characters.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the entire string is built by having two copies of s, but the second copy is not necessarily starting at the beginning of the second copy? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"the two messages are identical\", meaning they are two copies of the same string s. Then the error causes the two copies to be merged by overlapping. \n\n            The merging condition: the last k0 characters of the first copy must equal the first k0 characters of the second copy.\n\n            Then the entire string is: \n                [s[0: len(s)-k0]] + [s[len(s)-k0:]] + [s[k0:]]   ??? \n\n            Actually, no. The standard way is: \n                First copy: s (entirely)\n                Second copy: s, but we merge the last k0 characters of the first copy with the first k0 characters of the second copy.\n\n            Then the resulting string is: s + s[k0:]\n\n            But note: the entire string is built by having the first copy (without truncation) and the second copy without its first k0 characters.\n\n            So the total length is |s| + (|s| - k0) = 2*|s| - k0.\n\n            For s=\"acaca\", we have |s|=5, then total length = 10 - k0. We require 10 = 10 - k0 -> k0=0, which is not allowed.\n\n            But wait, the example output says \"acaca\", meaning that the base string is \"acaca\", and the entire string is built by this process. \n\n            How can we build \"acacacaca\" from \"acaca\" with an error? \n\n            The only way is if the entire string is built by having two copies of s=\"acaca\" and the error is applied once. \n\n            However, note that the example input also includes \"abababab\", which is output as \"ababab\". \n\n            For \"abababab\": \n                n=8.\n                We are told to output \"ababab\", which is length 6.\n\n                Then k0 = 2*6 - 8 = 4, which is between 1 and 5 (valid).\n                s = \"ababab\"\n                Then the entire string should be s + s[4:] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which matches.\n\n            Similarly, for \"acacacaca\", if we use s=\"acaca\" (length 5) we cannot explain. But if we use s=\"acacacaca\" (length 10) then k0=2*10-10=10, which is not allowed (k0 must be less than 10, but 10 is not <10).\n\n            Alternatively, what if we use a base string of length 4? \n                Then k0=2*4-10= -2 -> invalid.\n\n            Base string of length 3: k0=6-10=-4 -> invalid.\n\n            Base string of length 2: k0=4-10=-6 -> invalid.\n\n            Base string of length 1: k0=2-10=-8 -> invalid.\n\n            Base string of length 7: k0=14-10=4 -> valid (4<7). Then s = t[0:7] = \"acacaca\", then the rest of the string is t[7:10] = \"aca\", and s[4:] = \"ca\", which is not \"aca\".\n\n            Base string of length 8: k0=16-10=6 -> valid (6<8). Then s = t[0:8] = \"acacacac\", then the rest is t[8:10]=\"ac\", and s[6:] = \"ac\", which matches.\n\n            So we have a candidate s=\"acacacac\", and the entire string is built as \"acacacac\" + \"ac\" = \"acacacacac\", but wait, that is 10 characters? \n                \"acacacac\" (8 chars) + \"ac\" (2 chars) -> 10 chars, which is \"acacacacac\", but the given string is \"acacacaca\".\n\n            Let me write the given string: \"acacacaca\" -> \n                a c a c a c a c a c -> 10 characters.\n\n            The candidate s=\"acacacac\" (8 characters) produces \"acacacac\" + \"ac\" = \"acacacacac\", which is \"a c a c a c a c a c\", but the given string is \"a c a c a c a c a c\" -> wait, they are the same.\n\n            Actually, \"acacacacac\" is \"a c a c a c a c a c\", and \"acacacaca\" is \"a c a c a c a c a c\" -> same.\n\n            But the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", not \"acacacac\".\n\n            However, the problem says: if there are multiple possibilities, output any.\n\n            So why does the example output say \"acaca\"?\n\n            Let me try to use s=\"acaca\" (length5) again, but this time, note that the entire string might be built by having two errors? No, the problem says two identical messages sent consecutively, so one error.\n\n            After re‐reading the problem statement: \n                \"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно.\"\n\n            So there is only one error event.\n\n            How about breaking the string \"acacacaca\" as two copies of \"acaca\" with an error that overlaps differently? \n\n            The error model: the two messages are identical, so they are both \"acaca\". Then the entire string is built as:\n                First copy: \"acaca\"\n                Second copy: \"acaca\"\n\n            And the error causes an overlap of k0 (1<=k0<5). \n\n            Then the entire string is \"acaca\" + \"acaca\"[k0:].\n\n            We require that \"acaca\" + \"acaca\"[k0:] = \"acacacaca\".\n\n            Let me compute for different k0:\n\n            k0=1: \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"accacaca\" -> not matching.\n\n            k0=2: \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\" -> 7 characters.\n\n            k0=3: \"acaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacaca\" -> same as above.\n\n            k0=4: \"acaca\" + \"a\" = \"acacaca\" -> 6 characters.\n\n            None of these gives 10 characters.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the entire string is built by having the first copy being a substring of the second copy? \n\n            But the problem says the two messages are identical.\n\n            Another possibility: the base string s is \"aca\", then two copies with an overlap of 2: \n                s=\"aca\", then entire string = \"aca\" + \"ca\" = \"acaca\", which is 5 characters.\n\n            Or s=\"ac\", then entire string = \"ac\" + \"ac\"[k0:] for k0=1: \"ac\"+\"c\" = \"acc\", 3 characters.\n\n            Or s=\"aca\", and then the entire string is built by two copies with an error, but the error might occur in the middle? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not require that the entire string is built by simply concatenating the first copy and the second copy without its first k0 characters. It says the messages are",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of `k0` characters (where `0 < k0 < len(s)`). If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be the result of two copies of some string `s` merged with an overlap. The entire length of `t` is given by `len(t) = 2 * len(s) - k0`, where `k0` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k0 < len(s)).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `L` of `s`, we can derive `k0` as `2*L - len(t)`. We then check if `k0` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k0 < L). If so, we verify if the first `L` characters of `t` (which would be `s`) followed by the substring starting from `k0` in `t` matches the concatenation `s + s[k0:]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `L` of `s` from `ceil((n+1)/2)` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`). For each `L`, compute `k0` and check its validity. If valid, check if the string `t` can be split into two parts that match the required pattern.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `L` up to `n`, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case (due to substring operations). However, given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    found = False\n    s_candidate = None\n    \n    for L in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k0 = 2 * L - n\n        if k0 < 1 or k0 >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:L]\n        rest = t[L:]\n        expected_rest = s[k0:]\n        \n        if rest == expected_rest:\n            found = True\n            s_candidate = s\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `found` (to track if a valid `s` is found) and `s_candidate` (to store the valid `s`) are initialized.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of `s` (from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n-1`), compute the overlap length `k0`.\n4. **Check Validity of `k0`**: Ensure `k0` is positive and less than `L`.\n5. **Validate String Structure**: Check if the first `L` characters of `t` (potential `s`) followed by the substring starting at `k0` in `t` matches `s + s[k0:]`.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" and `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by overlapping two identical strings `s`, leveraging straightforward string operations and iteration.",
