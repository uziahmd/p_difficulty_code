The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The border of an (a x b) rectangle has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is at least 1x1, then the border is: \n        top and bottom: each row has b cells, but wait: actually for a rectangle of a rows and b columns:\n        total border cells = 2*a + 2*(b-2)   [for the top and bottom we have a full row, but the sides we have a-2 because the corners are already counted in the top and bottom?]\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   The border of a rectangle of a x b (with a>=1, b>=1) is:\n        If a==1 and b==1: 1\n        Otherwise, the perimeter is 2*(a + b) - 4? Actually no, because if we count the top row: b cells, bottom row: b cells, and the two side columns: (a-2) for each, so total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note: when the ring is drawn, the entire border of the inner rectangle is taken. But the problem says the ring has width 1 cell. And the rings are drawn on the grid.\n\n But note: the examples.\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n   w=3, h=3, k=1.\n   The first ring: inner rectangle is (3) x (3). Then the border of a 3x3 rectangle is: \n        top: 3, bottom: 3, and the two middle ones: but wait, the sides: the left and right columns have only 1 cell each (the middle row) because the top and bottom are already accounted for.\n        Actually, we can compute: 2*(3+3) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8. So that matches.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28.\n   Using the same formula: 2*(7+9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32-4 = 28. Correct.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n   First ring: 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n   Second ring: i=2, then the inner rectangle has width = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4 = 3, and height = 9-4=5.\n        Then the border for the second ring: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40.\n\n But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n However, note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. The first ring is the outermost, then the next one is 2 cells away. This means the second ring's rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n But note: the condition for k: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=7, h=9: min(7,9)=7 -> (7+1)//4 = 8//4 = 2. So k=2 is valid.\n\n However, what if we have a non-rectangular shape? Actually, the rings are defined by the inner rectangles. We must ensure that the inner rectangle for the i-th ring has positive dimensions.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are given w, h, k.\n 2. For each ring i from 1 to k:\n        Let a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let b = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        If either a or b becomes less than 2, then this ring would have negative or zero border? Actually, the border formula requires at least 1x1, but even then: \n            For 1x1: 2*(1+1)-4 = 0, which is not correct. So we must adjust.\n\n        However, note the condition: k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). This ensures",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the outer edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one. Each ring has a width of one cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are reduced by 4*(i-1) in both width and height from the original plate dimensions. The number of cells in the border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b is given by the formula: \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\). This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows (each contributing b cells) and the left and right columns (each contributing a-2 cells, since the corners are already counted).\n\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The problem constraints ensure that k is chosen such that the inner rectangles for all rings have positive dimensions. Specifically, k is limited to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\), which guarantees that all inner rectangles are valid (i.e., their dimensions are at least 1x1).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Using the formula \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\), calculate the number of cells in that ring's border. Sum these values across all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i-1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (a + b) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n        \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Calculate Inner Dimensions**: The inner rectangle's dimensions are derived by subtracting \\(4*(i-1)\\) from both the original width and height.\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, the loop breaks early as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Compute Ring Cells**: Using the formula \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\), the number of cells in the current ring's border is calculated.\n   - **Accumulate Total**: The cells from each valid ring are summed up.\n3. **Output Result**: The total number of cells to be gilded is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by adhering to the problem constraints. The complexity is O(k), which is optimal given the constraints.",
