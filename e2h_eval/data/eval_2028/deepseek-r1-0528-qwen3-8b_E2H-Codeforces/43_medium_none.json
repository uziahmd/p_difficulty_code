He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, but note that C appends c's and the condition on the number of c's is defined in terms of existing a's and b's).\n 2. The string should be split into three parts:\n    - First part: some number of 'a's (at least one)\n    - Second part: some number of 'b's (at least one) [Note: the problem says A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's]\n    - Third part: some number of 'c's (which must be either equal to the total number of 'a's or the total number of 'b's)\n\n However, note that the example includes cases where the order might not be strictly as above? Let's read the example:\n\n Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES\n   Breakdown: \n        Original from A: \"aaa\" (3 a's)\n        Then B appends: \"b\" (so now we have 3 a's and 1 b)\n        Then C appends: \"ccc\" (3 c's). Now the condition: number of c's = 3, which equals the number of a's (3). Also note the string is \"aaabccc\", so the order is: all a's, then one b, then three c's.\n\n But wait, the problem says:\n   - A has a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - B appends some number of 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends some number of 'c's to the end.\n\n So the entire string must be in the form: (one or more 'a') + (one or more 'b') + (one or more 'c')? Not necessarily: the problem does not say that the string is divided by contiguous groups. However, note the example \"aabc\": \n   Input: 'aabc' -> Output: 'YES'\n\n Let's break down \"aabc\":\n   Count of 'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1.\n   Condition for C: number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. Here, 1 == 1 (for 'b') so it satisfies.\n\n But wait, the string \"aabc\" is not having the form of contiguous a's then contiguous b's then contiguous c's? Actually, the problem does not require the string to have contiguous segments. However, note the process:\n\n   A gives a string of 'a's. Then B appends 'b's (so after that, the string is a bunch of a's and then a bunch of b's). Then C appends a bunch of c's.\n\n So the entire string must have two properties:\n   1. The string must be composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's (if we consider the original process). But wait, the example \"aabc\" is given as valid.\n\n However, the example \"aabc\" has:\n   'a', 'a', 'b', 'c' -> so the letters are not grouped by type. But note: the process is that A only uses 'a', then B appends 'b's (so the b's come after the a's), then C appends 'c's (so they come after the b's).\n\n Therefore, the entire string must be such that:\n   - All the a's must come before any b, and all the b's must come before any c? \n\n But wait, what if there is a mix? The problem says:\n\n   Step 1: A has a string of some number of 'a'. So the initial string is all a's.\n   Step 2: B appends some number of 'b' to the end. So after step 2, the string is (some a's)(then some b's). There is no interleaving because B appends to the end.\n   Step 3: C appends some number of 'c' to the end. So the entire string is (a's)(b's)(c's).\n\n Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. But note: the example \"aabc\" is \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\". This is contiguous: first two a's, then one b, then one c.\n\n However, consider: what if the string is \"abac\"? \n   According to the process, after step 1: \"a\", step 2: append one 'b' -> \"ab\", then step 3: append one 'c' -> \"abc\". But wait, if we have \"abac\", that doesn't follow the process because the second character is 'b' and then third is 'a'? That is not allowed.\n\n But note: the problem states that the string is built by appending at the end. So the relative order of the letters must be: all the a's (from A) then all the b's (from B) then all the c's (from C). Therefore, if we see an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c', that would break the process.\n\n However, the problem does not explicitly state that the string must be without mixing. It says:\n\n   A has a string of 'a's -> so let n_a = count('a')\n   Then B appends m_b (>=1) 'b's -> so now we have n_a a's and m_b b's, and the string is (n_a times 'a') followed by (m_b times 'b').\n   Then C appends k c's, where k is either n_a or m_b (or both) -> so the final string is (n_a times 'a') + (m_b times 'b') + (k times 'c').\n\n Therefore, the entire string must be divided into three contiguous parts: the first part is all a's, the second part is all b's, the third part is all c's.\n\n But note: what if the string does not contain a particular letter? The problem says that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends, so we must have at least one 'c' as well? Actually, no: the problem says C appends some number of 'c's (which could be zero? but the problem says \"some number\", and typically \"some\" implies at least one. However, the problem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", meaning that the appended c's must be at least one? Actually, note: the problem says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", and since the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least one, then the number of c's must be at least one. Therefore, the string must contain at least one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the example input \"bbacc\" is given as NO. Let's analyze \"bbacc\":\n\n   Count: \n      b: 3, a: 2, c: 2\n\n   But the condition: the number of c's must be either the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (3). Here, 2 is neither 3 nor 2? Wait, 2 is the number of a's, so condition holds for a's. But wait, the string \"bbacc\": \n        Is the string in the correct order? \n        The string starts with 'b' (which is not allowed because the first part must be a's). \n\n   Therefore, the string must have the form: [a's] then [b's] then [c's].\n\n Steps to solve:\n\n 1. Check that the string is non-decreasing in the following sense: \n        - The first occurrence of 'b' must come after the last occurrence of 'a' (if any) and the first occurrence of 'c' must come after the last occurrence of 'b' (if any).\n\n    Alternatively, we can check that the string does not have:\n        - 'b' before 'a' (i.e., if we see a 'b' then we must not see an 'a' after that)\n        - 'c' before 'b' or 'a' (but note: the process ensures that a's are first, then b's, then c's. So if we see a 'c', then we must not see an 'a' or 'b' after that.)\n\n 2. We must also ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, the problem says after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends, so we get at least one 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or b's. Since a's and b's are at least one, then the number of c's is at least one. So the string must have at least one of each.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b'\" exists after B appends, so the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends at least one 'c'. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But note: what if the string does not have a particular letter? Then we break.\n\n However, the problem does not explicitly say that the string must have a 'c'. But according to the process, C appends some number (at least one) of 'c'. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n 3. How to check the order?\n\n    We can traverse the string and make sure that:\n        - We don't have a 'b' until we have finished all the a's? Actually, we can have multiple a's, then multiple b's, then multiple c's.\n\n    Steps for order check:\n        - Let's find the last occurrence of 'a'. Then from that index onward, we should only have 'b' and 'c'. But wait, we can have a's, then b's, then c's. Actually, the condition is that once a 'b' appears, we cannot have an 'a' again. Similarly, once a 'c' appears, we cannot have an 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let i = 0\n        While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If we can traverse the entire string and i reaches the end, then the order is correct.\n\n    But wait, what if the string has no 'b'? Then the above will break. However, we know from the problem that there must be at least one 'b' (because after B appends, there is at least one 'b'). Similarly, we must have at least one 'c' (from C's appending). And at least one 'a'.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b'\" exist in the string (after B appends). Then C appends, so we have at least one 'c'. Therefore, we must have at least one of each.\n\n    But wait, what if the string is \"aaa\" (only a's)? Then we break because we require at least one b. Similarly, if we have \"aaaabbb\" (no c) then we break because C must append at least one c. However, note: the problem says that the string is built by the three steps, so we must have the three parts.\n\n    However, the problem does not say that the string must have all three letters. It says that initially A gives a string of a's (so there is at least one a). Then B appends at least one b. Then C appends at least one c (because the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or b's, which are at least one). So yes, the string must have at least one of each.\n\n    Therefore, we can check:\n\n        Condition 1: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n        Condition 2: The string must be in the form: a's (possibly zero or more) then b's (at least one) then c's (at least one). But wait, the problem says A's part has at least one a, so the a's part must be at least one.\n\n        Actually, the problem states: \n            - A has a string of some number of lowercase English letters 'a' (so at least one a).\n            - Then B appends some number of 'b' (so at least one b).\n            - Then C appends some number of 'c' (so at least one c).\n\n        Therefore, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        if 'a' not in S or 'b' not in S or 'c' not in S:\n            return \"NO\"\n\n    Then, check the order: we can use the three while loops.\n\n        i = 0\n        # Read all a's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all b's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all c's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        If i != len(S): then there is a character that breaks the order -> \"NO\"\n\n        Otherwise, check the condition on the number of c's:\n\n        Let:\n            count_a = number of 'a' in the entire string\n            count_b = number of 'b' in the entire string\n            count_c = number of 'c' in the entire string\n\n        Then, we require that count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\n        But note: the problem says the number of c's appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the entire string? \n\n        Important: The condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The entire string? Or the string at the time when C is appending?\n\n        When C appends, the string already has the a's and b's (and no c's). Then C appends count_c = either count_a (at that time, which is the same as the entire string's a's) or count_b (which is the entire string's b's). But note: the entire string's a's and b's are the same as the counts at the time of C's appending because C appends at the end.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\": \n            count_a = 3, count_b = 1, count_c = 3 -> condition holds because 3==3.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\":\n            count_a = 2, count_b = 1, count_c = 1 -> condition holds because 1==1 (count_b).\n\n        Example: \"abbccc\": \n            count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=3 -> condition: 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> \"NO\"\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\": \n            count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2 -> condition holds because 2==2 (both a and b).\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\", then the condition is satisfied because 2==2.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"aabbbcc\": \n            count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 (a) -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the condition says: the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In the entire string, the number of a's is 2 and the number of b's is 3. The number of c's is 2. So 2==2 (a) -> YES.\n\n        But note: the string must be in the correct order. For \"aabbbcc\", the order is correct.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have count_a=4, count_b=3, count_c=3? Then condition holds because 3==3 (b). \n\n    So algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, print \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Check the order: the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n        Step 3: Check that the total count of 'c' is either equal to the total count of 'a' or the total count of 'b'.\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" (example 1) and we break the order by having a 'b' after a 'c'? Then the order check fails.\n\n        However, note: our order check uses the fact that we read a's, then b's, then c's. So if we see a 'c' and then a 'b', the order check will fail.\n\n        Example: \"acb\" -> \n            Step 1: contains a, b, c -> passes.\n            Step 2: \n                Read a's: 'a' -> then i=1.\n                Then read b's: at index1 is 'c' -> fails the while loop for b's, so i remains 1.\n                Then read c's: from index1: 'c' is matched, then next is 'b' -> fails because we try to read a 'b' in the c's part.\n\n            So we break and say NO.\n\n        But wait, the example \"bbacc\" is given as NO. Let's check \"bbacc\":\n\n            Step 1: \n                Check for 'a': present, 'b': present, 'c': present -> passes.\n\n            Step 2: \n                Start: \n                    Read a's: first char is 'b' -> so we don't enter the a's loop. i=0.\n                    Then read b's: we have 'b','b','b' -> i becomes 3.\n                    Then read c's: at index3 we have 'a' -> fails.\n\n            So we break and say NO.\n\n        Another example: \"aabc\" (given as YES) -> \n            Step 1: has a, b, c -> passes.\n            Step 2:\n                Read a's: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n                Then read b's: \"b\" -> i=3.\n                Then read c's: \"c\" -> i=4 -> entire string is traversed.\n\n            Then check counts: \n                count_a = 2, count_b = 1, count_c = 1 -> 1==1 (b) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabccc\" (as in the example) -> \n            Step 1: has a, b, c -> passes.\n            Step 2:\n                Read a's: \"aaaa\" -> i=4.\n                Then read b's: \"b\" -> i=5.\n                Then read c's: \"ccc\" -> i=8 -> entire string.\n\n            Counts: \n                count_a=4, count_b=1, count_c=3 -> 3==4? no, 3==1? no -> NO.\n\n            But wait, the example input was \"aaabccc\", not \"aaaabccc\". Let me check the example: \n                Example input: \"aaabccc\" -> \n                    count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 -> 3==3 (a) -> YES.\n\n            Our example \"aaaabccc\" would be NO, which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example input provided was \"aaabccc\", not \"aaaabccc\". So we are matching the example.\n\n        But note: the example input list was ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'].\n\n        So our algorithm for \"aaabccc\":\n            Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n            Step 2: \n                Read a's: \"aaa\" -> i=3.\n                Then read b's: \"b\" -> i=4.\n                Then read c's: \"ccc\" -> i=7 -> entire string.\n\n            Then check: count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 -> condition holds (3==3) -> YES.\n\n        Example \"bbacc\" (second example) -> we already saw: order fails -> NO.\n\n        Example \"aabc\" (third example) -> YES.\n\n        One more example: \"abbccc\" (which I made up) -> \n            Step 1: has a, b, c -> yes.\n            Step 2: \n                Read a's: \"a\" -> i=1.\n                Then read b's: \"bb\" -> i=3.\n                Then read c's: \"ccc\" -> i=6 -> entire string.\n\n            Counts: a=1, b=2, c=3 -> 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aabbcc\" (four a's? wait, no: \"aabbcc\" has two a's, two b's, two c's) -> \n            Step 2: \n                Read a's: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n                Then read b's: \"bb\" -> i=4.\n                Then read c's: \"cc\" -> i=6 -> entire string.\n\n            Counts: 2==2 -> YES.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"aabbcc\" but the order is broken? For example, \"aabccb\"? \n            Step 2: \n                Read a's: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n                Then read b's: \"bb\" -> i=4.\n                Then read c's: starting at index4: 'c' -> then next is 'c' (okay) but then we have 'b' at the end -> fails.\n\n        So we output NO for \"aabccb\".\n\n    However, note: the problem says that C appends the c's at the end. Therefore, the entire string must be built as:\n\n        [some a's][some b's][some c's]\n\n    So the order is strict.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\", but the condition is that the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. \n        In \"aaabbbccc\": \n            a:3, b:3, c:3 -> condition holds (3==3 for a or b).\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\": \n        a:4, b:3, c:3 -> condition holds because c=3 and b=3.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Read the string S.\n\n        if 'a' not in S or 'b' not in S or 'c' not in S:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit\n\n        i = 0\n        n = len(S)\n\n        # Skip all a's\n        while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Skip all b's\n        while i < n and S[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Skip all c's\n        while i < n and S[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit\n\n        count_a = S.count('a')\n        count_b = S.count('b')\n        count_c = S.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But wait: the problem does not require that the entire string is exactly the three contiguous parts? What if there is a letter that is not 'a','b','c'? The problem says the string consists of these three, so we don't worry.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n    Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \"aaabccc\"\n        count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n    Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n        Step 1: has 'a','b','c' -> so we proceed.\n        Step 2: \n            Start at 'b' -> skip a's: i=0, then skip b's: i=3 (because we have three b's? Actually, the string is \"bbacc\": \n                indices: \n                    0: 'b'\n                    1: 'b'\n                    2: 'a' -> but wait, we are skipping a's only at the beginning. \n\n        Actually, the code above for skipping a's: we start at the beginning and skip consecutive a's. In \"bbacc\", the first character is 'b', so we skip no a's (i remains 0). Then we skip b's: we take the two b's (index0 and 1) -> then at index2 we have 'a'. Then we break out of the b's loop. Then we try to skip c's: at index2 we have 'a' -> so we break. Then i=2, which is not the end (n=5) -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n    But wait, the example \"bbacc\" is given as NO, and our code returns NO.\n\n    Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n        Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            Skip a's: \"aa\" -> i becomes 2.\n            Skip b's: \"b\" -> i becomes 3.\n            Skip c's: \"c\" -> i becomes 4 -> entire string.\n\n        Then check: count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaccc\" (with no b's)? Then the first condition fails because we require at least one b. But wait, the problem says after B appends, there is at least one b. So we must have at least one b. Our code checks for the presence of 'b', so if there's no 'b', we print \"NO\".\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end\", so we must have at least one b.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"accc\"? \n        Step 1: check for 'a','b','c' -> missing 'b' -> \"NO\".\n\n    Similarly, \"abbc\": \n        Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            Skip a's: \"a\" -> i=1.\n            Skip b's: \"bb\" -> i=3.\n            Skip c's: \"c\" -> i=4 -> entire string.\n\n        Then check: count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=1 -> condition: 1==1 (a) -> YES.\n\n    But wait: the problem says that the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. Here, the number of a's is 1, and the number of c's is 1 -> condition holds.\n\n    However, note: the string \"abbc\" is built as:\n        A: \"a\"\n        B: appends two 'b's -> \"abb\"\n        C: appends one 'c' -> \"abbc\"\n\n    This matches.\n\n    But wait, what if the string is \"abbbc\"?\n        Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            a's: \"a\" -> i=1.\n            b's: \"bbb\" -> i=4.\n            c's: \"c\" -> i=5 -> entire string.\n\n        Counts: a=1, b=3, c=1 -> condition: 1==1 (a) -> YES.\n\n    But wait, the condition says the number of c's is equal to the number of a's (which is 1) OR the number of b's (which is 3). 1==1 -> YES.\n\n    However, consider a string that has the correct order but the counts condition fails.\n\n    Example: \"aabbcc\" (already considered) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aabbccd\": \n        Step 2: \n            a's: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n            b's: \"bb\" -> i=4.\n            c's: \"cc\" -> i=6.\n            Then we have 'd'? But the string only contains 'a','b','c' per the input guarantee. So we don't have to worry.\n\n    But wait, the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string is guaranteed to consist of 'a','b','c'. So we don't need to check for other characters.\n\n    One more corner: empty string? The problem states |S|>=1.\n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        i = 0\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Skip all consecutive 'a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Skip all consecutive 'b's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Skip all consecutive 'c's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But wait: what if the string has the correct order but the counts condition fails? Example: \"aabbbc\" (a=2, b=3, c=1) -> \n        Condition: 1==2? no, 1==3? no -> NO.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In this case, the entire string has 2 a's and 3 b's, and the c's are 1. So condition fails.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" (a=4, b=3, c=3) -> condition holds because 3==3 (b). \n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbcccccc\" (a=4, b=3, c=6) -> condition: 6==4? no, 6==3? no -> NO.\n\n    But wait: the problem says that C appends a number of c's that is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In the entire string, the a's are 4 and the b's are 3. The c's are 6, which is not 4 and not 3 -> NO.\n\n    However, note: when C appends, the string already has the a's and b's. The condition is based on the counts at the time of C's appending. But note: the entire string's a's and b's are the same as the counts at the time of C's appending because C appends at the end. So the condition is on the entire string's a's and b's.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if the string has non contiguous a's? Actually, we are checking the order by the three contiguous parts. So if the string is not in the form of a's then b's then c's, we say NO.\n\n    Example: \"aba\" -> \n        Step 1: has a,b -> but wait, no 'c'? Actually, we check for the presence of 'c' first: \n            'a' in \"aba\" -> yes, 'b' in \"aba\" -> yes, but 'c' not in \"aba\" -> so we print \"NO\" at the first condition.\n\n    Example: \"abc\" -> \n        Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            Read a's: \"a\" -> i=1.\n            Read b's: \"b\" -> i=2.\n            Read c's: \"c\" -> i=3 -> entire string.\n\n        Then counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n    But wait: the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends, so the entire string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. And the order must be a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n    \"abc\" is built by:\n        A: \"a\"\n        B: appends \"b\" -> \"ab\"\n        C: appends \"c\" (since the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's (1) or b's (1) -> 1. So \"abc\" is valid.\n\n    However, note the example \"abc\" is given as YES.\n\n    But wait, the example input list did not include \"abc\", but the example output list was for ['aaabccc','bbacc','aabc'].\n\n    But according to the problem, \"abc\" should be YES.\n\n    However, let me double-check the problem statement: \n        - The string must be built by: \n            Step 1: A has a string of 'a's (at least one).\n            Step 2: B appends 'b's (at least one).\n            Step 3: C appends 'c's (at least one), and the number of c's is the number of a's OR the number of b's.\n\n        In \"abc\": \n            a's: 1, b's: 1, c's: 1 -> condition holds.\n\n        And the order is correct.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"acb\"? \n        Step 1: has a, c, b -> but wait, we check for the presence of 'a','b','c'. It has them. Then we check the order:\n\n        Read a's: \"a\" -> i=1.\n        Then read b's: the next char is 'c' -> so we break and then we try to read c's: from index1: 'c' -> then we break because next is 'b' (which is not c). Then i=2, not the end -> NO.\n\n    Correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string is built by appending, so the order is fixed. We assume that the string is built by A, then B, then C. Therefore, the order must be a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n    Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        i = 0\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Traverse the a's part\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Traverse the b's part\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Traverse the c's part\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require the entire string to be only these three parts? Actually, the process builds the string by appending, so the string must be exactly the a's then b's then c's. Therefore, the above order check is necessary.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" and we have an extra 'a' at the end? For example, \"aabbcc\" is okay, but \"aabbcac\" is not because of the 'a' in the c part? \n\n    Actually, the order check will fail because after the c's part we have an 'a'. \n\n    Example: \"aabbcac\" -> \n        Step 1: has a,b,c -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            Skip a's: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n            Skip b's: \"bb\" -> i=4.\n            Skip c's: \"c\" -> i=5. Then at index5: 'a' -> breaks the c's part. Then i=5, which is less than 6 -> NO.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    But wait, what if the string has a different arrangement? For example, \"ba\"? \n        Step 1: has 'a' and 'b' but",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's to it, and C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c', and the characters must appear in the correct order (all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's). Additionally, the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Character Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order results in \"NO\".\n3. **Check Count Condition**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If this condition is not met, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n        \n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the string contains all three required characters ('a', 'b', and 'c'). If any character is missing, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Order Validation**: The code then verifies that the string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with one or more 'c's. This is done by traversing the string sequentially through each segment. If the traversal does not cover the entire string, it means the order is incorrect, and the code prints \"NO\".\n3. **Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order, the code counts the occurrences of each character. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
