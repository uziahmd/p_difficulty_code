There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament is arranged such that two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but note that the problem does not require the entire tournament to be fixed, only that the winner's path is maximized.\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must win k games. How do we arrange the tournament so that the winner plays k games?\n\n Consider that the tournament has a structure that resembles a complete binary tree (but not necessarily full). However, note the condition: two players can play only if the number of games they have played so far differs by at most one.\n\n We can model the tournament as having two types of matches: \n   - In the first type, a player with i losses (or i wins, but actually we count wins) can play against a player with i or i+1 wins.\n\n But note: the problem says the winner must win all his games. So the entire path for the winner must consist of consecutive wins.\n\n How many players are required for a winner to play k games?\n In the k-th game (the last one), the winner must face a player who has played k-1 games (and won them). How did that player get k-1 wins? That requires a subtree of size corresponding to the minimum number of players needed to produce a player with k-1 wins.\n\n Actually, we can build the tournament from the bottom up:\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a tournament where one player wins k games.\n\n The base case: \n   k=0 -> 1 player (does nothing)\n   k=1 -> 2 players (one game)\n   k=2: the winner must beat two opponents. But note the condition: the two opponents must have been played in separate matches. However, the winner must have played the first match and then the second. For the second match, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Since the winner has 1 game, the opponent must have 0 or 1. But wait, the opponent for the second game must have won one game already (if we are to maximize the winner's games). So the opponent for the second game must have beaten someone. Therefore, we need at least 1 + (for the first opponent: 1) + (for the second opponent: 1 more game meaning that opponent must have come from a mini-tournament of 2 players) -> total 1 (the winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (the two players that feed into the second opponent) = 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n   Let a_k be the minimum number of players needed to have a winner with k wins.\n\n Then, the winner must beat one player that came from a subtree where the winner had k-1 wins (so that player had k-1 wins) and one player that came from a subtree that produced a player with k-1 wins? But wait, the condition allows the opponent to have k-1 or k (which is k-1 for the winner's next game) or k-1 (because the winner's current count is k-1, so opponent can have k-1 or k? Actually, the condition is: the difference is at most one. So for the k-th game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k wins? \n\n However, note: the winner is about to play his k-th game, so before this game he has k-1 wins. Therefore, the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k wins? Actually, no: the rule says \"the number of games one of them has already played\" (which are wins, because they must have won all) so the opponent's wins must be either k-2, k-1, or k? But wait, the tournament hasn't happened yet, so the opponent's wins are the ones they have already played. \n\n However, note: the opponent is about to play their k-th game? Not necessarily. The rule only requires that the two players' previous games (wins) differ by at most one. So if the winner has k-1 wins, then the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins (inclusive). \n\n But we want to maximize the number of games the winner plays. So we want to use the condition to allow the opponent to have as many wins as possible? Actually, to have the tournament as large as possible, we want to use the minimal number of players to achieve k wins for the winner, so",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games (wins) is at most one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the goal is to find the largest `k` such that there exists a valid tournament structure where the winner plays `k` games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to accumulate as many wins as possible while adhering to the constraint that any two players can only play if their previous wins differ by no more than one. This resembles a binary tree structure where each level represents a round of matches.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games does not exceed `n`. The minimal number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games can be derived by considering the sum of a geometric series.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a binary search approach to efficiently find the maximum `k`. For each candidate `k`, we calculate the minimal number of players required. The calculation involves summing the series `1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(k-1)` which equals `2^k - 1`. If this value is less than or equal to `n`, then `k` is feasible.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The binary search runs in logarithmic time relative to `n`, making it efficient even for very large `n` (up to 10^18).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = n\n    \n    ans = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        required_players = (1 << mid) - 1 if mid > 0 else 1\n        if required_players <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to `n` (the total number of players). The variable `ans` keeps track of the maximum feasible `k`.\n2. **Mid Calculation**: For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search range, compute the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `mid` games. This is done using the formula `(1 << mid) - 1`, which efficiently calculates `2^mid - 1` using bit shifting.\n3. **Feasibility Check**: If the computed `required_players` is less than or equal to `n`, it means `mid` is a feasible number of games, so `ans` is updated to `mid`, and the search continues in the upper half. Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.\n4. **Output Result**: After the binary search completes, the highest feasible `k` (stored in `ans`) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `k` using binary search, leveraging bit operations for quick calculations, and ensures optimal performance even for very large input sizes.",
