    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with length n)\n\n Note: the binary representation s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} corresponds to m = s0*2^{n-1} + s1*2^{n-2} + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n But note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. However, the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the i-th bit of x (from the problem's definition) is associated with a_i.\n\n Specifically, if we consider the binary representation of x, then for index i (0-indexed from the least significant bit?), note that the problem says \"bit(i)\" is 1 if the binary representation of x has a 1 at the i-th position.\n\n However, note the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits: \n   bit(0): 1 (LSB) -> a0\n   bit(1): 1 -> a1\n   bit(3): 1 -> a3\n\n But wait, the example input for m is given as a string of n digits (without spaces). The example says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1\", and then m equals sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i * 2^(n-1-i) ?\n\n Actually, the example says: \"for example, if n=4 and x=11 (11=2^0+2^1+2^3)\", so the i-th bit in their function f(x) corresponds to the exponent i, meaning the binary representation of x is considered with the least significant bit being the 0-th bit.\n\n However, the representation of m is given as a string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. The problem states: \"the binary representation of number m\" is s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. \n\n Then, note: \n   In the example, m is given as a binary string of length n. But wait, the example input for the first sample is:\n\n      Input: \n        2\n        3 8\n        10\n\n      Here, n=2, and the binary string is \"10\". So m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n      Then, the constraint is 0<=x<=m, i.e., 0<=x<=2.\n\n      And the example says: f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\n\n      Now, note: the array a has two elements: [3,8]. According to the function, when x=0: no bits set -> 0.\n      When x=1: binary representation is '1' (but we have n=2, so we need to represent x with n bits? or just the minimal representation?).\n\n      The problem says: \"where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n      But note: the example input gives m in n digits. So probably, we are considering x in the same bit-length? However, note that x can be any integer from 0 to m, and m is represented with n bits.\n\n      But wait, the example m=2 is represented as \"10\", which is two bits. So we must consider x in the range [0,2] and represent x with up to n bits (which is 2 bits). \n\n      How does the function f(x) work for x=0,1,2?\n        x=0: binary (with 2 bits): 00 -> no bits set -> f(0)=0.\n        x=1: binary (with 2 bits): 01 -> only the 0th bit (least significant) is set -> so we use a0 -> 3.\n        x=2: binary (with 2 bits): 10 -> the 1st bit is set -> so we use a1 -> 8.\n\n      Then why the example says maximum is 3? Because 0<=x<=2, and we are only allowed x=0,1,2. But note: 8 is greater than 3. However, wait the example output is 3.\n\n      Let me check the example: \n          Input: \n            2\n            3 8\n            10\n\n          Output: 3\n\n      Why is the maximum 3? Because we cannot use x=2? But wait, the constraint is 0<=x<=m, and m=2, so x=2 is allowed. Then f(2)=8, which is greater than 3.\n\n      There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n      Rethink: the problem says the array a is of size n, and the function uses the i-th element for the i-th bit. In the example, n=2, so there are two bits. The bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB). \n\n      However, in the example, the representation of m is \"10\", which is two bits: the most significant bit is the first one. \n\n      But note: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (from the least significant? or from the most significant?)?\n\n      The example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits: \n        bit(0): 1 -> a0\n        bit(1): 1 -> a1\n        bit(3): 1 -> a3\n\n      So the indexing is from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost). \n\n      Now, for the first sample: \n        n=2, array a = [3,8] -> a0=3, a1=8.\n        We are representing x in n bits (so two bits). Then:\n          x=0: 00 -> no bits -> 0.\n          x=1: 01 -> bit0 is set -> a0=3.\n          x=2: 10 -> bit1 is set -> a1=8.\n\n      Then the maximum should be 8.\n\n      But the example output is 3.\n\n      Wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n          ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n      and the expected outputs are:\n\n          ['3', '27']\n\n      So the first sample output is 3.\n\n      This implies that the example might have a different interpretation of the function f(x). Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n        Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position.\n\n      And the example: n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011 in binary) then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n      So the i-th position: is it the i-th bit from the right (starting at 0) OR from the left (starting at 0)?\n\n      The problem says: \"binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\".\n\n      Typically, we write the binary representation with the most significant bit first. But the example for x=11 (which is 8+2+1) is written as 1011, and then they say:\n\n        bit(0): the rightmost bit (LSB) is set -> so index0 corresponds to the rightmost bit.\n\n      So the i-th position is the i-th bit from the right (starting at 0 for the least significant).\n\n      Then, in the first sample: n=2, so the array a has two elements, and the bits of x (represented in n=2 bits) are:\n\n        bit0 (LSB) -> a0\n        bit1 (MSB) -> a1\n\n      Now, what is the value of x=2? In two bits, 2 is represented as \"10\", so the MSB is set (bit1) and the LSB is not. Then f(2)=a1=8.\n\n      But the example output is 3. \n\n      Alternatively, let me look at the constraints: the binary string for m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. And m is the number with these bits.\n\n      The example m is \"10\", so m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) ? Actually, no: the problem says \"Number m equals \". But the example says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n      In standard positional notation, the string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} represents:\n\n        m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n      But then, for the first sample: \"10\" -> n=2, so m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n      Now, the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (from the right? or from the left?) to select a_i.\n\n      However, note: the example x=11 (in base10) is represented as 1011 (base2) in 4 bits. The problem says: \n          if n=4 and x=11 (11=2^0+2^1+2^3), then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n      This means: \n        bit0 (LSB) is set -> use a0\n        bit1 is set -> use a1\n        bit2 is not set -> skip\n        bit3 is set -> use a3\n\n      So the indexing in the array a is by the bit index (with the least significant being index0). \n\n      But the representation of m is given as a string of n bits (from most significant to least significant). \n\n      Now, the constraint is 0<=x<=m. We must consider x in the range [0, m]. \n\n      However, note: the problem does not specify that we must use exactly n bits for x. But the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. Since x is an integer, its binary representation has a fixed number of bits. But note: the function f(x) considers bits beyond the n-th bit? \n\n      The problem says: the array a has n elements, so there are n bits (from bit0 to bit{n-1})? Actually, the function f(x) will consider all bits of x, but the array a only has indices 0 to n-1. \n\n      But wait, the example: n=4, and x=11 (which is 1011) has 4 bits. What if x has more than n bits? Then the function f(x) would use the bits beyond the n-1-th bit and there is no corresponding a_i for those bits. \n\n      However, note the condition: x <= m. And m is given in n bits. The maximum value of x is m, which is an n-bit number. Therefore, x can have at most n bits (if we consider the minimal representation, but actually numbers with more than n bits would exceed m). \n\n      But wait: what if m is 0b1000 (n=4, so m=8)? Then x can be 8, which is 1000 in base2, and that is exactly n bits. \n\n      However, note: the array a has n elements, so the function f(x) for an x that has a bit set at position i (for i>=n) would require an a_i that does not exist. \n\n      Therefore, we must assume that the function f(x) only considers the lower n bits of x? Or that the array a is defined for bit indices 0 to n-1, and any bit beyond n-1 is ignored (since we don't have a_n, a_{n+1}, etc.)? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. However, note that the problem says \"an integer from 0 to 2^n - 1\" for x. \n\n      Let me check the problem statement: \"function f(x), taking an integer from 0 to 2^n - 1 as its single argument\"\n\n      So x is from 0 to 2^n-1. Then, the binary representation of x has at most n bits. \n\n      Therefore, we know that x has at most n bits. Then, the function f(x) is defined by:\n\n          f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [if the i-th bit of x is set then a_i else 0]\n\n      Now, the issue in the first sample: n=2, m=2 (binary \"10\"). Then x can be 0,1,2.\n\n      For x=0: 00 -> f(0)=0\n      For x=1: 01 -> f(1)=a0=3\n      For x=2: 10 -> f(2)=a1=8\n\n      Then the maximum is 8.\n\n      But the example output is 3.\n\n      There is a contradiction.\n\n      After re‐reading the problem statement: the input for the first sample is:\n\n          2\n          3 8\n          10\n\n      But note: the third line is the binary representation of m. The problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as a string of n digits.\n\n      However, the example also says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n      Wait, here they say m=20=1? That doesn't make sense.\n\n      Actually, the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\" — that seems like a typo. They probably meant m=2 (since 10 in binary is 2). But then they say f(1)=3, which is correct, but they don't mention f(2)=8.\n\n      But the problem says: find the maximum of function f(x) for 0<=x<=m. So if m=2, then we must consider x=0,1,2.\n\n      Then why the example output is 3? \n\n      Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the binary representation string is given in the opposite order? \n\n      Let me check the second sample:\n\n          Input: \n              5\n              17 0 10 2 1\n              11010\n\n          m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n          Then, the maximum value is 27. How?\n\n          The array a has 5 elements: [17, 0, 10, 2, 1]\n\n          The function f(x) is defined by the bits of x (using the array a for bits 0 to 4).\n\n          We need to choose an x in [0,26] such that the sum of a_i for every set bit i is maximized.\n\n          Note: the bits are from 0 (LSB) to 4 (MSB). \n\n          Example: x=5: binary (5 bits) is 00101 -> bits 0 and 2 are set -> f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n          So the maximum is 27.\n\n          Now, what if we consider the first sample again: \n\n            n=2, a=[3,8], m=2 (binary \"10\") -> m=2.\n\n            We must consider x in [0,2]. The possible x and their f(x):\n\n                x=0: 00 -> 0\n                x=1: 01 -> a0=3\n                x=2: 10 -> a1=8\n\n            Then the maximum is 8.\n\n          But the example output is 3.\n\n      This suggests that the problem might have intended the binary representation to be interpreted in reverse order for the array a.\n\n      Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n      And the example: n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) -> f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n      Now, the example's binary representation for x=11 is written as 1011 (from left to right). But the problem does not specify the endianness. \n\n      However, note: the example m is given as \"10\" for the first sample. And the problem says the third line is the binary representation of m. \n\n      But in the example, they say m=20 (which is 2) and then they write the binary representation as \"10\", meaning that the first digit is the most significant.\n\n      Now, the key: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (from the least significant) to pick a_i. But the representation of m is given in the usual way (most significant first). \n\n      However, the function f(x) does not care about the representation of m, only about the bits of x.\n\n      But wait, the problem says: the array a has n elements, and the i-th bit of x (with i from 0 to n-1) is used to select a_i. \n\n      Now, the problem also says: the third line is the binary representation of m, and m is represented as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. \n\n      There is no direct relation between the bits of m and the bits of x. \n\n      However, the constraint is 0<=x<=m. \n\n      The issue in the first sample: why is the answer 3?\n\n      After reading the problem statement again, I notice: the example says \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\". \n\n      Wait, that might be a translation issue. Let me parse: \"m = 20 = 1\" — this doesn't make sense. \n\n      Alternatively, the problem statement might have been:\n\n        \"In the first test case m = 2 (which is 10 in binary) and the maximum value is 3.\"\n\n      But then why the example output is 3 and not 8?\n\n      Another possibility: the array a is given in the order of the bits from most significant to least significant? \n\n      In the first sample: \n          n=2, array a = [3,8]\n          m is given as \"10\" (which is 2)\n\n      But if we interpret the array a as:\n          a0 corresponds to the most significant bit (bit1) and a1 corresponds to the least significant bit (bit0) — then the function f(x) would be defined differently.\n\n      However, the example for n=4 and x=11: \n          x=11 (binary 1011) has:\n            bit0 (LSB) = 1 -> a0 (if a0 is the LSB) -> but the example uses a0 for the LSB.\n\n      The problem states: \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\", and then f(x) is the sum of a_i for which bit(i) is set.\n\n      So the index i is the bit index (with 0 being the least significant). Therefore, the array a is indexed by the bit index (LSB first). \n\n      Then, in the first sample, a0 is for bit0 (LSB) and a1 is for bit1 (MSB).\n\n      Now, consider the constraint: x<=m. The m is given as a binary string of n bits (most significant first). \n\n      But note: the value of x is compared numerically to m. \n\n      The issue is that the example input \"10\" for m (n=2) means m=2. Then x=2 is allowed, and f(2)=a1=8.\n\n      However, the example output is 3.\n\n      This leads me to suspect that the problem intended the binary representation string to be the little-endian representation (i.e., the first character is the least significant bit) OR that the array a is given in the order of the bits from MSB to LSB.\n\n      Let me assume that the array a is given from MSB to LSB. Then for n=2:\n\n          a0: corresponds to the bit at position n-1 (i.e., the most significant, which is bit1)\n          a1: corresponds to the bit at position 0 (the least significant)\n\n      Then, for x=0: 00 -> 0\n      x=1: 01 -> only bit0 is set -> a1 (which is the last element of the array) -> 8? \n      But wait, the array is [3,8]. If the array is given from MSB to LSB, then:\n          a[0] = 3 (for the most significant bit, bit1)\n          a[1] = 8 (for the least significant bit, bit0)\n\n      Then:\n        x=0: 00 -> 0\n        x=1: 01 -> bit0 is set -> a[1]=8\n        x=2: 10 -> bit1 is set -> a[0]=3\n\n      Then the maximum is 8 (from x=1) and 3 (from x=2) -> 8 is larger.\n\n      But the example output is 3.\n\n      Alternatively, if we consider the array a given in the order of increasing bit index (LSB first) and the binary representation of m is given in big-endian (most significant first) then everything is consistent except the first sample's answer.\n\n      What if the problem intended the binary representation string to be in little-endian? Then the first sample's m is given as \"01\" (if we swap the bits) but the input is \"10\".\n\n      Another possibility: the problem's example description of the first sample is incorrect.\n\n      After checking the example: the problem says \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\" \n\n      Wait, they wrote m=20? But then they say m=1. \n\n      This is very confusing.\n\n      Let me look at the sample inputs:\n\n          First sample input: \n              2\n              3 8\n              10\n\n          Second sample input:\n              5\n              17 0 10 2 1\n              11010\n\n      And the outputs: \n          First: 3\n          Second: 27\n\n      How can we get 3 in the first sample?\n\n      If we assume that the array a is given in the order of the bits from MSB to LSB, and the function f(x) uses the bit positions (with the same order as the representation of m) then:\n\n          n=2, a=[3,8] -> a0 for the most significant bit (bit1), a1 for the least significant (bit0)\n\n          Then, for x=0: 00 -> 0\n          x=1: 01 -> bit0 set -> a1=8\n          x=2: 10 -> bit1 set -> a0=3\n\n          Then the maximum is max(0,8,3)=8.\n\n      Alternatively, if the array a is given in the order of the bits from LSB to MSB, then:\n\n          a0 for bit0 (LSB), a1 for bit1 (MSB)\n\n          Then, for x=0:0, x=1:3, x=2:8 -> maximum 8.\n\n      But wait, the example output is 3. \n\n      Another idea: the problem's function f(x) is defined using the bits of x, but the array a is given in the order of the bits from MSB to LSB, and the constraint x<=m is applied with m represented in the same bit order (big-endian) but the function f(x) uses the bits in the same order as the array a (i.e., the i-th bit of x (from the most significant) is used to select a_i). \n\n      Then, for the first sample: \n          n=2, a=[3,8] -> a0 for bit0 (MSB), a1 for bit1 (LSB)\n          m is given as \"10\" (big-endian) -> m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n          Now, we consider x in [0,2] and represent x in 2 bits (big-endian):\n\n          x=0: 00 -> bit0=0, bit1=0 -> f(0)=0\n          x=1: 01 -> bit0=1, bit1=0 -> f(1)=a0 (because bit0 is the most significant) = 3\n          x=2: 10 -> bit0=1, bit1=0 -> f(2)=a0=3\n\n          Then the maximum is 3.\n\n      This matches the example output.\n\n      So the problem is: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x in the same order as the representation of m (which is big-endian). Specifically, the i-th bit of x (counting from the most significant) is used to select a_i.\n\n      But wait, the example for n=4 and x=11:\n\n          m is given in big-endian (4 bits), but the function f(x) for x=11 (which is 1011 in big-endian) would use:\n\n          bit0 (MSB): 1 -> a0\n          bit1: 0 -> skip\n          bit2: 1 -> a2\n          bit3 (LSB): 1 -> a3\n\n          Then f(11)=a0+a2+a3.\n\n          However, the example says f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n      Now, the example says: \"if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23)\", meaning the exponents are 0,1,3. These are the bit positions counting from the least significant.\n\n      But wait, 20 is 2^0, 21 is 2^1, 23 is 2^3. This is little-endian.\n\n      There is a clear conflict.\n\n      Let me clarify:\n\n      The problem states two things:\n\n        1. The function f(x) uses the i-th bit (whatever that means) to select a_i.\n        2. The binary representation of m is given as a string of n bits (big-endian) and x is an integer from 0 to 2^n-1.\n\n      And the example: n=4, x=11, then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n      This matches little-endian: \n          In little-endian, the bits of 11 (binary 1011) are written from least significant to most significant: \n            bit0 (LSB): 1 -> a0\n            bit1: 1 -> a1\n            bit2: 0 -> skip\n            bit3: 1 -> a3\n\n      But the representation of m is given in big-endian (most significant first). \n\n      How does the constraint work then? \n\n      Example: m is given in big-endian, but the function f(x) uses little-endian bit indexing.\n\n      In the first sample: \n          n=2, a=[3,8], m is given in big-endian as \"10\" (meaning m=2).\n\n          Then, we consider x in [0,2] and we must represent x in little-endian for the function f(x) but use big-endian for comparing with m?\n\n      Actually, no: the value of x is an integer. We don't change the value of x based on endianness. The function f(x) uses the bits of x (and the bits are fixed by the integer representation). \n\n      However, the array a is indexed by the bit index (either big-endian or little-endian) and the problem says the i-th bit.\n\n      The key is: the problem's definition of \"i-th position\" in the binary representation. \n\n      In mathematics, the binary representation of a number is usually written with the most significant bit first. But the function f(x) says \"the i-th position\", without specifying.\n\n      But the example for n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011 in big-endian) says the set bits are at positions 0,1,3 — which are the exponents (i.e., the power of two). This is little-endian indexing (if we consider the least significant bit as position0).\n\n      Therefore, the problem must be using little-endian indexing for the bits (i.e., the least significant bit is bit0).\n\n      But then, why did the first sample work out to 3 under the assumption of big-endian indexing for the function?\n\n      Let me try the first sample with little-endian indexing for the function:\n\n          n=2, a=[3,8] -> a0 for bit0 (LSB), a1 for bit1 (MSB)\n\n          m is given in big-endian as \"10\" (which is 2).\n\n          Now, consider x in [0,2]:\n\n          x=0: binary (big-endian) is \"00\", but as an integer, its bits are: \n                bit0 (LSB):0, bit1:0 -> f(0)=0.\n\n          x=1: binary (big-endian) is \"01\", but as an integer, the bits are:\n                bit0:1, bit1:0 -> f(1)=a0=3.\n\n          x=2: binary (big-endian) is \"10\", but as an integer, the bits are:\n                bit0:0, bit1:1 -> f(2)=a1=8.\n\n          Then the maximum is 8.\n\n      This does not match.\n\n      But if we assume the function f(x) uses big-endian indexing (i.e., the most significant bit is bit0) then:\n\n          x=0: \"00\" -> bit0=0, bit1=0 -> f(0)=0.\n          x=1: \"01\" -> bit0=0, bit1=1 -> f(1)=a1=8.\n          x=2: \"10\" -> bit0=1, bit1=0 -> f(2)=a0=3.\n\n          Then the maximum is 8.\n\n      But the example output is 3.\n\n      This is still not matching.\n\n      After re‐reading the problem statement: the function f(x) is defined by the formula:\n\n          f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * [bit(i) in x]\n\n      and the array a has n elements.\n\n      The example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n      This matches little-endian indexing (LSB is bit0).\n\n      Now, the constraint: 0<=x<=m, and m is given by its binary representation (big-endian) of length n.\n\n      How to solve the problem?\n\n      We are to find the maximum of f(x) for x in [0, m].\n\n      Since x is an integer from 0 to m, and m is given as a binary string of length n (big-endian), we can think of x as a binary number with up to n bits (big-endian).\n\n      But the function f(x) uses little-endian indexing: the i-th bit (counting from the least significant) is used to select a_i.\n\n      However, the little-endian representation of a number is the reverse of the big-endian representation.\n\n      Let me define:\n\n          Let the big-endian representation of x be b_{n-1} b_{n-2} ... b_0 (so b_{n-1} is the most significant).\n          Then the little-endian representation is b_0 b_1 ... b_{n-1}.\n\n      But wait, the integer value of x is:\n\n          big-endian: x = b_{n-1} * 2^{n-1} + b_{n-2} * 2^{n-2} + ... + b_0 * 2^0.\n\n      And in little-endian, the bits are assigned as:\n\n          bit0 (LSB) = b_0, bit1 = b_1, ..., bit_{n-1} = b_{n-1}.\n\n      Then, the function f(x) = a0 * (b0) + a1 * (b1) + ... + a_{n-1} * (b_{n-1])\n\n      But note: the array a is given in the order: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n      However, in the example n=4, x=11 (big-endian representation for 4 bits is \"1011\" -> because 8+2+1=11, and 4 bits: 1*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 -> so big-endian: '1','0','1','1').\n\n      Then, the little-endian representation of the bits is the reverse: '1','1','0','1'. \n\n      But wait, the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (little-endian) to select a_i. \n\n      Little-endian bit0 is the least significant bit, which is the last bit (the one with weight 2^0). In the big-endian representation, the least significant bit is the last character.\n\n      So, to compute f(x) for an integer x (represented in big-endian as a string s of length n) we do:\n\n          Let b = list(map(int, s))   # big-endian: b[0] is the most significant, b[n-1] is the least significant.\n\n          Then, the little-endian bit0 is b[n-1], bit1 is b[n-2], bit2 is b[n-3], ... bit_{n-1} is b[0].\n\n          Then, f(x) = a_{n-1} * b[0] + a_{n-2} * b[1] + ... + a_0 * b[n-1]\n\n      Alternatively, if we reverse the array a, then:\n\n          Let a_rev = a[::-1]   # so a_rev[0] = a_{n-1}, a_rev[1]=a_{n-2}, ..., a_rev[n-1]=a0.\n\n          Then, f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_rev[i] * b[i]   [where b is the big-endian representation of x]\n\n      But note: the array a is given in the order a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n      Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n          We want to express x in big-endian (n bits) and then:\n\n          f(x) = a_{n-1} * (MSB of x) + a_{n-2} * (next bit) + ... + a_0 * (LSB of x)\n\n      But the problem says: the i-th bit (little-endian) is the one with weight 2^i. And in the big-endian representation, the bit with weight 2^i is at position n-1-i.\n\n      Therefore, the function f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * (bit_{n-1-i} of x in big-endian)\n\n      But wait, the example n=4, x=11 (big-endian \"1011\"):\n\n          a0 = 3, a1=0, a2=10, a3=2   ??? \n\n      Actually, the example second sample has n=5, so let me stick to the first sample.\n\n      First sample: n=2, a=[3,8], x=1 (big-endian \"01\"):\n\n          big-endian: '0','1' -> b0=0, b1=1.\n          Then, little-endian bit0 = b1=1 -> a0=3.\n          little-endian bit1 = b0=0 -> a1=8 -> not used.\n\n          f(x)=3.\n\n      x=2 (big-endian \"10\"): \n          b0=1, b1=0.\n          little-endian bit0 = b1=0 -> a0=3 -> not used",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) in the range \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. The binary representation of \\( m \\) is provided as a string of length \\( n \\), and the array \\( a \\) has \\( n \\) elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the function \\( f(x) \\) depends on the bits set in the binary representation of \\( x \\). Each bit position \\( i \\) (0-indexed from the least significant bit) in \\( x \\) contributes \\( a_i \\) to \\( f(x) \\) if the bit is set. However, the binary representation of \\( m \\) is given in big-endian order (most significant bit first), while the function \\( f(x) \\) uses little-endian bit indexing (least significant bit first).\n\n2. **Insight**: To efficiently compute \\( f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) up to \\( m \\), we can use dynamic programming or greedy selection. However, a more efficient approach involves processing the bits of \\( m \\) from the most significant to the least significant, deciding whether to set each bit in \\( x \\) to maximize \\( f(x) \\) without exceeding \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We traverse the binary digits of \\( m \\) from left to right (big-endian). For each bit, we decide whether setting it in \\( x \\) would allow us to include higher-value bits in subsequent positions. This involves checking if setting the current bit does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\) and whether the gain from including the current bit outweighs any potential losses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) exactly once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits in \\( m \\). This is optimal given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_bin_str = data[2].strip()\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    tight = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        bit_val = int(m_bin_str[i])\n        if tight:\n            if bit_val == 1:\n                total_sum += a_list[n-1-i]\n                tight = False\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            total_sum += a_list[n-1-i]\n\n    print(total_sum)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of bits \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\) of size \\( n \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total_sum` to accumulate the sum of selected elements from \\( a \\) and `tight` to ensure we do not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Processing Bits**: For each bit in the binary string of \\( m \\):\n   - If we are still constrained by \\( m \\) (`tight` is True), we check if the current bit is set (1). If it is, we add the corresponding element from \\( a \\) (which is indexed from the end) to `total_sum` and release the constraint (`tight` becomes False). If the bit is not set, we proceed without adding anything.\n   - Once the constraint is released, we can freely add all subsequent elements from \\( a \\) corresponding to the bits in \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all bits, `total_sum` holds the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\) in the range \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired maximum by leveraging the structure of the binary representation and the properties of the function \\( f(x) \\).",
