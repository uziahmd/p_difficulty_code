The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one for the chests (a_i) and one for the keys (b_j)\n The condition for a key j to open a chest i is: (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning they must have opposite parity.\n\n Note: \n   If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd.\n   If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\n We can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups: even_chests (where a_i % 2 == 0) and odd_chests (a_i % 2 == 1).\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into even_keys (b_j % 2 == 0) and odd_keys (b_j % 2 == 1).\n\n Now, note the matching:\n   - Even chests require odd keys.\n   - Odd chests require even keys.\n\n But we cannot use a key more than once and a chest only once.\n\n Therefore, we have two bipartite graphs (actually two independent matchings):\n\n   Matching 1: Between even_chests and odd_keys.\n   Matching 2: Between odd_chests and even_keys.\n\n However, note that the keys and chests are distinct and we cannot mix the two matchings arbitrarily.\n\n Since the condition is strict and the two types of keys (odd and even) are only used for the opposite parity chests, we can do:\n\n Let:\n   E_c = number of even_chests\n   O_c = number of odd_chests\n\n   E_k = number of even_keys\n   O_k = number of odd_keys\n\n Then, the maximum chests we can open is limited by the available keys in the required sets.\n\n For even_chests: we can use at most min(E_c, O_k) chests from even_chests (because we need an odd key for each, and there are O_k odd keys).\n For odd_chests: we can use at most min(O_c, E_k) chests from odd_chests.\n\n However, wait: the catch is that we have a total set of keys. But note: the two sets of keys (even and odd) are fixed and the same key cannot be used twice.\n\n But also note: the problem does not require to use all keys. We are limited by the number of keys of the appropriate type.\n\n However, consider: we have two independent sets of requirements. The two sets of keys (even and odd) are used in different ways.\n\n Therefore, the maximum number of chests we can open is:\n\n   result = min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n But wait: let me test with the example.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Separate chests:\n      even_chests: [14,6,2] -> 3\n      odd_chests: [9,11] -> 2\n\n   Separate keys:\n      even_keys: [8,4,20] -> 3\n      odd_keys: [7] -> 1\n\n   Then according to the formula:\n      even_chests matched with odd_keys: min(3, 1) = 1\n      odd_chests matched with even_keys: min(2, 3) = 2\n      total = 1 + 2 = 3 -> which matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k=1, E_k=0\n\n   Then: min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0 -> total=1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0.\n\n   Then: min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total=0.\n\n However, let's consider if we have overlapping usage? Actually, the two conditions are independent because:\n   - The even_chests only require odd_keys, and the odd_chests only require even_keys.\n\n And the keys are partitioned into even and odd. So we can use the odd_keys for even_chests and the even_keys for odd_chests without interference.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply:\n\n   answer = min(even_chests_count, odd_keys_count) + min(odd_chests_count, even_keys_count)\n\n But wait: what if we have more keys of one type than needed? We don't need to use all keys, so we just use as many as the chests require.\n\n However, note that we have two separate constraints: the even_chests can only be opened by odd_keys, and odd_chests by even_keys.\n\n So the above formula is correct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, m\n   Step 2: Read the list of n chests\n   Step 3: Read the list of m keys\n\n   Step 4: Count:\n        even_chests = count of numbers in chests with num % 2 == 0\n        odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n        even_keys = count of numbers in keys with num % 2 == 0\n        odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   Step 5: Print min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: what if we have multiple keys of the same parity? The condition is only about the parity. So we don't care about the exact values beyond parity.\n\n This solution is O(n+m) and handles up to 10^5 elements.\n\n But wait: let's reexamine the condition. The condition is defined by the sum being odd. The sum is odd if one is even and the other is odd. So yes, we only need the parities.\n\n However, note: the input numbers can be large (up to 10^9) but the modulus operation is cheap.\n\n But note: negative numbers? The problem states: \"1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^9\", so positive.\n\n So we can safely do modulus 2.\n\n Let me code accordingly.\n\n Example: \n\n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   even_chests: [14,6,2] -> 3\n   odd_chests: [9,11] -> 2\n   even_keys: [8,4,20] -> 3\n   odd_keys: [7] -> 1\n\n   Output: 3\n\n Another example: \n\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   even_chests: 5, odd_chests:0\n   even_keys:0, odd_keys:1\n   Output: min(5,1)+min(0,0)=1+0=1\n\n Example: \n\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   even_chests:1, odd_chests:0\n   even_keys:4, odd_keys:0\n   Output: min(1,0)+min(0,4)=0+0=0\n\n It matches.\n\n But wait: what if we have a chest with an even number and a key with an odd number? That works. Similarly, odd chest and even key.\n\n However, what if we have a chest with an even number and an even key? Then the sum is even -> not allowed. Similarly, odd and odd -> even, not allowed.\n\n So the matching is indeed only between the opposite parity.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chests = sum(1 for x in chests if x % 2 == 0)\n   odd_chests = len(chests) - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = sum(1 for x in keys if x % 2 == 0)\n   odd_keys = len(keys) - even_keys\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   print(result)\n\n However, wait: the problem says one key can be used to open at most one chest and vice versa. Our calculation is based on the counts of keys of the right type. But note: we are not using the same key twice because we are counting independently for the two types. Also, the two sets (even_chests and odd_chests) use disjoint sets of keys (the odd_keys for even_chests and even_keys for odd_chests). So we are not overcounting.\n\n But what if we have more keys of one type than the chests require? Then we are limited by the chests. Similarly, if we have fewer keys, then we are limited by the keys.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Let me test with an example where the counts are such that we are limited by both:\n\n   Example: \n     Chests: [2,4] (even_chests=2, odd_chests=0)\n     Keys: [1,3] (odd_keys=2, even_keys=0)\n\n   Then: min(2,2) + min(0,0) = 2.\n\n   But wait: we have two even_chests and two odd_keys. Each even_chest requires one odd_key. So we can open both.\n\n   Example: \n     Chests: [2,4,6] (3 even, 0 odd)\n     Keys: [1,3] (2 odd, 0 even)\n\n   Then: min(3,2)=2, so we can open 2 out of 3.\n\n   Example: \n     Chests: [2,4,6] (3 even, 0 odd)\n     Keys: [1,3,5] (3 odd, 0 even)\n\n   Then: min(3,3)=3.\n\n   Example: \n     Chests: [2,4,6] (3 even, 0 odd)\n     Keys: [1] (1 odd, 0 even)\n\n   Then: min(3,1)=1.\n\n So the solution is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says that the keys and chests are given as two separate lists. We are only counting the parities.\n\n But wait: what if the same key is used for two different chests? The problem says one key at most once. In our counting, we are only counting the total number of keys of each type, but we are not accounting for the fact that we might use a key from the odd set for an even chest and then we cannot use it again. However, we are matching the entire set of odd_keys to the even_chests and even_keys to the odd_chests. Since the two sets are disjoint (one uses odd keys and the other uses even keys), the total number of keys used is the sum of the two matches.\n\n And we are not exceeding the available keys because:\n\n   For even_chests: we use at most odd_keys_count (which is the total available odd_keys) but note: we are taking the minimum of even_chests and odd_keys, so we don't use more than available.\n\n   Similarly for odd_chests.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the input might be large (up to 10^5 elements). The counting is linear and efficient.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chests = 0\n   for chest in chests:\n        if chest % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = 0\n   for key in keys:\n        if key % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   print(result)\n\n But note: the example inputs are given as strings. The input() function will read the first line, then the second, then the third.\n\n However, the example input format is:\n\n   First line: \"5 4\"\n   Second line: \"9 14 6 2 11\"\n   Third line: \"8 4 7 20\"\n\n We can also use:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   n = int(data[0]); m = int(data[1])\n   chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n   keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n\n But the problem says the first line has n and m, then the next line has n integers, then the next line has m integers.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n This is standard.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   even_chests: [14,6,2] -> 3\n   odd_chests: [9,11] -> 2\n   even_keys: [8,4,20] -> 3\n   odd_keys: [7] -> 1\n\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   even_chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> 5\n   odd_chests: 0\n   even_keys: 0 (since 5 is odd)\n   odd_keys: 1\n   result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   even_chests: [10] -> 1\n   odd_chests: 0\n   even_keys: [20,30,40,50] -> 4\n   odd_keys: 0\n   result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n It works.\n\n However, wait: the example input string was provided as:\n\n   ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n But the output was:\n\n   ['3', '1', '0']\n\n So we are printing the integer 3, then 1, then 0.\n\n But the problem expects the output as a string of the number? Actually, the example output is printed as:\n\n   print('3')   -> but wait, the example output is shown as 3, not as a string.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\"\n\n So we can just print the integer.\n\n But the example output is given as ['3', '1', '0'] meaning they are strings. But in competitive programming, we usually output the integer.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the output format beyond the number. But the example output is shown as a string of digits.\n\n Let me check: the example output is exactly the number. So we can output the integer.\n\n But the problem says: \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" and the example outputs are integers.\n\n However, in the example, the output is printed without any quotes.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   print(result)\n\n But note: the example input was given as a string, and we are reading from stdin.\n\n I'll write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, so we must use efficient counting.\n\n The counting loops are O(n) and O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chests = 0\n   for chest in chests:\n        if chest % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = 0\n   for key in keys:\n        if key % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   print(result)\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n But wait: there's another example in the note?\n\n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\" -> Output 3.\n\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\" -> Output 1.\n\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\" -> Output 0.\n\n All correct.\n\n However, I notice that the example input is given as a string in the problem, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n But the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\n Therefore, we are good.\n\n But wait: what if the input numbers are negative? The problem states: \"1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^9\", so no negatives.\n\n We are safe.\n\n I'll submit the code as is.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means they must have opposite parity (one even and one odd). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The condition for a valid match is that the sum of the chest's number and the key's number must be odd. This translates to needing one even-numbered chest with an odd-numbered key or one odd-numbered chest with an even-numbered key.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing the chests and keys into even and odd groups, we can independently count how many chests of each type can be matched with keys of the opposite parity. The solution involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the number of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the number of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves simple counting and arithmetic operations. We iterate through the lists of chests and keys to count their parities, then compute the result based on the counts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element in the input lists exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for chest in chests:\n        if chest % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for key in keys:\n        if key % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of chests (n) and keys (m). The next n values are the chest numbers, followed by m key numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even-numbered. The remaining chests and keys are implicitly odd-numbered.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys (since even chests require odd keys) and adding it to the minimum of odd chests and even keys (since odd chests require even keys). This gives the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed as an integer.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding key usage limits, adhering to the problem constraints.",
