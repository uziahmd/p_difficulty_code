The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are moving along a circular ringroad (clockwise) with n houses. \n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each task i requires being in house ai, and we must complete tasks in order.\n\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), we can only move clockwise. However, note that the ringroad is circular so going from house k to house k+1 is one step, but from house n to house 1 is also one step (because it's a ring).\n\n The challenge: We have to do the tasks in increasing index order (i.e., first task, then second, etc.). \n But note: the problem states \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that we must have done all previous tasks.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Explanation: \n   Start at 1.\n   Then go to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n   Then go to 2: from 3, we can't go backwards. We must go 3->4->1->2 (3 steps)\n   Then go to 3: from 2, we do 2->3 (1 step)\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n But note: The example input format: \n   First line: n=4, m=3\n   Second line: [3, 2, 3]\n\n Alternate view: \n   We can break the journey into segments from the current location (initially 1) to the next task's house, and then update the current location.\n\n However, note that after completing a task, we are at that house and then we have to move to the next task's house.\n\n But because the ring is circular, we can also consider the possibility of moving multiple times around? However, the optimal path is always the minimal clockwise distance.\n\n Observation:\n   The movement is always clockwise. Therefore, from a current house `cur` to the next task house `a`, the distance is:\n\n   Option 1: Go directly clockwise without wrapping: if a >= cur, then distance = a - cur.\n   Option 2: If a < cur, then we have to go from cur to n (which is n - cur) and then from 1 to a (which is a - 1). But wait, we are at cur and then we go to n and then wrap to 1 and then to a. Alternatively, we can think of the entire circle as having length n. The clockwise distance from cur to a is (a - cur) mod n, but because we are only allowed to go clockwise, we cannot use negative mod. Actually, the clockwise distance from cur to a when a < cur is (a + n - cur). \n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the distance from cur to a (clockwise) as: \n        if a >= cur: d = a - cur\n        else: d = a - cur + n\n\n   However, note that in the example from 3 to 2 (in a ring of 4): \n        cur=3, a=2 -> 2-3 = -1, then -1+4 = 3. Correct.\n\n   But wait, the example from 2 to 3: \n        cur=2, a=3 -> 3-2=1. Correct.\n\n   So the distance for one segment is: \n        d = (a - cur) % n   -> but modulo might not give the positive value if we do modulus n. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        d = (a - cur) % n\n        But if (a - cur) is negative, then (a - cur) % n gives a value from 0 to n-1, but that is not the same as the above.\n\n   Actually, we want the non-negative clockwise steps. The formula (a - cur + n) % n doesn't work because if a>=cur then (a-cur+n)%n = a-cur+n, which is too big.\n\n   Let me define: \n        d = (a - cur) % n   -> This isn't the way because we don't want the modulus to wrap for positive.\n\n   Instead, we can use: \n        d = (a - cur) if a >= cur else (a - cur + n)\n\n   But note: we are doing multiple tasks and updating the current location.\n\n Steps:\n   Start at current = 1.\n   total_time = 0\n   For each task in the list of tasks (m integers):\n        d = (task - current) if task >= current else (task - current + n)\n        total_time += d\n        current = task\n\n However, let's test with the example [3,2,3] (n=4):\n\n   current = 1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The ringroad consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in sequence, moving from her current house to the next task's house via the shortest clockwise path.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that movement is restricted to clockwise direction only. Therefore, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` (where `a` is the current position) can be calculated as:\n   - If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, the distance is simply `b - a`.\n   - If `b` is less than `a`, the distance is `(b + n) - a` (accounting for the circular nature of the ringroad).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in sequence, starting from house 1. For each task, we compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house, add this distance to the total time, and update the current house to the task's house. This ensures that we always take the shortest path in the allowed direction.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            distance = a - current\n        else:\n            distance = a - current + n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of tasks.\n- **Processing Tasks**: Starting from house 1, for each task, the code calculates the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house. If the task's house is ahead (or equal) in the clockwise direction, the distance is straightforward. Otherwise, the distance accounts for wrapping around the end of the ringroad.\n- **Updating Position and Time**: After each task, the current house is updated to the task's house, and the computed distance is added to the total time.\n- **Output**: Finally, the total time taken to complete all tasks is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and processing each task in sequence with optimal path calculations.",
