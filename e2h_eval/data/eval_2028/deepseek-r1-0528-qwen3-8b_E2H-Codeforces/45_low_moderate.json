There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament grid must follow the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the rule allows for some flexibility. However, note that the winner must win k games. Therefore, the tournament must have at least k rounds (if we consider the standard bracket) but the structure might be more balanced.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players required for a winner to play k games under the given rule.\n\n How to build the tournament for k games?\n - In the first game, the winner (player 1) plays one game.\n - Then, to play the second game, the next opponent must have played at most 1 game (so either 0 or 1). But since the next opponent hasn't played any game (unless we arrange differently) then we can use the rule to allow an initial imbalance.\n\n However, note the rule: \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\"\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to building a binary tree with a constraint on the levels. But note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner plays k games.\n\n Another way to think: the winner must face k opponents. Each of these opponents, in order to face the winner, must have won some games. Moreover, the structure must satisfy the condition.\n\n Consider building the tournament from the bottom up:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to win k games.\n\n To win the first game: we need 2 players (the winner and one opponent). So F(1) = 2.\n\n To win the second game: the winner must have played one game, so the next opponent must have played 0 or 1 game. But if we use a player that has played 0 games, then we need to have a subtree for that opponent? Actually, we can set up:\n\n Option 1: The winner's first opponent is a player who hasn't played any game (so that's one game for the winner, and then the winner plays again). But then the opponent of the second game must have played at most 1 game. However, the winner's first opponent lost, so that opponent didn't play any more. But wait, we can have two separate matches for the two opponents? \n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n - The winner plays in the final and then k-1 previous games.\n\n But note: the rule does not require that the tournament is balanced. However, to maximize the winner's games, we want to minimize the number of players used per game of the winner.\n\n How to compute F(k):\n\n Let F(0) = 1 (a dummy player, but we don't count as the winner hasn't started)\n But actually, we start with the winner having 0 games, then he needs to play one game.\n\n Actually, let me define:\n   F(1) = 2\n   For k >= 2, the winner's k-th game must be against an opponent that has played at most k-1 games (since the winner has played k-1). But that opponent must have come from a subtree of the tournament that requires F(k-1) players (if the opponent won k-2 games) OR from a subtree that requires F(k-1) players? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can break down the tournament as:\n\n   The winner must have two types of opponents:\n     - One opponent that comes from a subtree that has been completed with k-1 games (meaning that opponent has played k-1 games) and then they meet in the k-th game.\n     - But wait, the rule says the difference is at most one. So when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has played k-1 games, so the opponent can have played either k-2, k-1, or k? Actually, no: the opponent must have played at most k-1 (because the winner has k-1) and at least k-2? \n\n However, note: the opponent must have won k-1 games to get to that point? Actually, no. The opponent must have played a certain number of games to reach the final match. But the rule is applied at the time of the match. So when the winner is playing his k-th game (which is the k-th win), the opponent must have played between k-2 and k-1 games.\n\n But how do we form",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their number of previous games is at most one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint. The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players required for the winner to win \\( k \\) games does not exceed \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to win \\( k \\) games can be derived by considering a binary tree-like structure where each level of the tree represents a round of matches. The winner must defeat \\( k \\) opponents, each of whom must have won a certain number of their own matches. The constraint ensures that the tournament can be structured such that the winner's path to victory is balanced.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach to find the maximum \\( k \\) by iteratively checking if the minimal number of players needed for \\( k \\) wins is less than or equal to \\( n \\). The minimal number of players for \\( k \\) wins is calculated based on the formula \\( 2^k - 1 \\), which accounts for a perfectly balanced binary tree where each game eliminates one player.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible values of \\( k \\) using binary search, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(\\log n) \\), which is optimal given the constraints (since \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    low = 1\n    high = n\n    ans = 0\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        total_players_needed = (1 << mid) - 1\n        \n        if total_players_needed <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Binary Search Setup**: The algorithm initializes binary search bounds (`low` and `high`) to find the maximum number of games \\( k \\) the winner can play.\n2. **Mid Calculation**: For each midpoint \\( k \\) in the binary search, it calculates the minimal number of players required for the winner to win \\( k \\) games using the formula \\( 2^k - 1 \\).\n3. **Feasibility Check**: If the calculated number of players is within the given \\( n \\), it updates the answer and searches for a higher \\( k \\); otherwise, it searches lower.\n4. **Output Result**: After completing the binary search, the highest feasible \\( k \\) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the tournament winner can participate in under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of \\( n \\).",
