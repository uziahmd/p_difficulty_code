She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open.\n\n There are two main types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor (left/right) one tab at a time, but note that the boundaries change as tabs are closed.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that the problem allows closing either side from the current cursor position, and the boundaries a and b update as we close tabs.\n\n Observation:\n We need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. This means we must close tabs from 1 to l-1 (if any) and from r+1 to n (if any).\n\n The process can be broken down into two parts: \n   Part 1: Closing the left part (tabs 1 to l-1)\n   Part 2: Closing the right part (tabs r+1 to n)\n\n But note: we might be able to combine movements and closures in a way that minimizes the total seconds.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote:\n   current cursor position: pos (initially given)\n\n We have two possible strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: \n   First, move the cursor to the left boundary (which will be l) and then close the left part (all tabs to the left of the cursor).\n   Then, from l, move the cursor to the right boundary (r) and then close the right part.\n\n However, we can also consider:\n\n Strategy 2: \n   First, close one side (either left or right) and then the other.\n\n But note: when we close one side, the boundaries change. For example, if we close the left side first, then the left boundary becomes the original l? Actually, no: initially, we have tabs from 1 to n. When we close the left part, we close from 1 to l-1, so the left boundary becomes l. Similarly for the right.\n\n However, the problem says that the boundaries a and b are the min and max index of unclosed tabs. So after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes l, and the right boundary remains n until we close the right part.\n\n We can also consider:\n\n Option A: \n   Step 1: Move the cursor to l (if needed) and then close the left part (if there is any left part to close). Then, move the cursor from l to r and then close the right part.\n\n Option B:\n   Step 1: Move the cursor to r (if needed) and then close the right part. Then, move the cursor to l and then close the left part.\n\n Option C: Maybe we can do both closures without moving the cursor to one of the ends first? But note: to close the left part, the cursor must be at a position such that the left closure operation will remove up to the current left boundary. Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" removes every tab from the current left boundary (a) to i-1. Similarly, the right operation removes from i+1 to the current right boundary (b).\n\n However, note: if we are at a position i, then closing the left part will remove [a, i-1] and the new left boundary becomes i (if i was the first unclosed tab) or still a if a was already beyond? Actually, the definition says: a is the minimum index of an unclosed tab, and b the maximum. Initially, a=1, b=n.\n\n After closing the left part, the left boundary becomes the current cursor position (because the closure operation removes everything to the left of i, so the next left boundary is i). Similarly, closing the right part sets the right boundary to the current cursor.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" — meaning from the current left boundary (a) to i-1. So if we are at i, then after closing the left, the left boundary becomes i. Similarly, closing the right part sets the right boundary to i.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily need to move the cursor to l to close the left part. We can close the left part from a position i as long as i >= l? Actually, no: because the left closure operation closes from a to i-1. We want to close from a to l-1. So we need to have the cursor at a position i such that i-1 >= l-1, meaning i>=l. But note: if we are at i (which is >=l) and we close the left part, then we remove from a to i-1. We want to remove only from a to l-1. Therefore, we must have i-1 >= l-1 and also we don't want to remove more than necessary. However, the operation does not allow choosing how much to remove. It removes everything from the current left boundary (which is the smallest index of an unclosed tab) to i-1.\n\n So, if we are at a position i (with i>=l) then the closure operation will remove from the current left boundary (which initially is 1) to i-1. But we only want to remove from 1 to l-1. Therefore, we must ensure that i-1 >= l-1, but if i-1 > l-1, then we remove too much (we remove from 1 to i-1, which includes more than just [1, l-1]). That is acceptable because the goal is to leave [l, r] and we can remove more, but we must not break the requirement (we can remove extra). However, if we remove too much, then the left boundary becomes i, and then we cannot recover the part from l to i-1 (which we don't want to keep). But wait, we want to leave [l, r] so if we remove from 1 to i-1, then the remaining tabs are from i to n. We require that the remaining tabs are from l to r. Therefore, we must have i<=l? Actually, no: if we are at i (which is greater than l) and we close the left part, then we remove from 1 to i-1, and then we have tabs from i to n. But we want to keep [l, r]. Since i>l, then the tab l is still present? No, because we removed from 1 to i-1, and l < i, so l is in [1, i-1] and gets removed. That is bad.\n\n Therefore, to close the left part (from 1 to l-1) we must be at a position i such that i <= l? Actually, no: we want to remove exactly [1, l-1]. The operation removes [a, i-1]. We start with a=1. So we set i = l. Then we remove [1, l-1]. Then the left boundary becomes l.\n\n Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a position i such that i >= r, then we remove [i+1, b] (where b is the current right boundary, initially n). Then the right boundary becomes i.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the following:\n\n We have two operations: left-close and right-close. Each operation requires that the cursor is at the boundary (or beyond) of the segment we wish to remove. Specifically, to remove the left part (from 1 to l-1), we must be at least at l (so that we don't remove the tab l). But if we are at l, then we remove [1, l-1] (exactly what we want). Similarly, to remove the right part, we must be at least at r.\n\n Now, the problem is: we start at `pos`. We may need to move the cursor to a certain position to perform the closure.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: If there is nothing to close (i.e., [l, r] is the entire set of tabs [1, n]), then answer 0.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have two segments to close: left (if l>1) and right (if r<n).\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't require that we close the left and then the right. We could also close the right and then the left. And we can interleave moves and closures.\n\n But note: once we close one side, the boundaries change and the movement costs (in terms of the number of tabs we can move) change? Actually, the movement is defined by the current boundaries: from i we can move to max(i-1, a) or min(i+1, b). However, after closing a side, the boundaries become the cursor's position for that side.\n\n However, the problem allows us to close one side and then the other, and we can choose the order.\n\n We can consider two orders:\n\n Order 1: Close left then right.\n   Step 1: If there is a left part (l>1), then we must get the cursor to l (to close the left part). The cost for moving from `pos` to l is abs(pos - l). Then we do one closure (left).\n   Step 2: Then we must move from l to r (if there is a right part, i.e., r<n). The cost for moving from l to r is abs(l - r). Then we do one closure (right).\n\n   Total cost for this order: abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r) + 2\n\n Order 2: Close right then left.\n   Step 1: If there is a right part (r<n), then we must get the cursor to r (to close the right part). The cost for moving from `pos` to r is abs(pos - r). Then we do one closure (right).\n   Step 2: Then we must move from r to l (if there is a left part, i.e., l>1). The cost for moving from r to l is abs(r - l). Then we do one closure (left).\n\n   Total cost for this order: abs(pos-r) + abs(r-l) + 2\n\n But wait, what if we don't need to close both sides? Then we only do one closure.\n\n Case 3: Only left part exists (r == n, but l>1). Then we only need to close the left part. We must get the cursor to l (if the cursor is not already at l) and then close the left. The cost is abs(pos-l) + 1.\n\n Case 4: Only right part exists (l==1, but r<n). Then we must get the cursor to r and then close the right. The cost is abs(pos-r) + 1.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might not need to move the cursor to the boundary if the cursor is already in the desired segment. But also, we can close a side from anywhere as long as we don't remove the required segment. But we saw above that to close the left part we must be at l (so that we don't remove l). Similarly for the right.\n\n But wait: what if we are at a position i that is less than l? Then we can close the left part from i? \n   Operation: close left from i: we remove from a to i-1. Since i<l, then i-1 < l-1, so we remove [a, i-1] which is a subset of [1, l-1] (because i-1 < l-1). Then the left boundary becomes i. Then we still have the tabs from i to l-1 and then l to r. But we want to remove only [1, l-1] and keep [l, r]. So if i < l, then after closing the left part we still have tabs from i to l-1 (which are not in [l, r]) and from l to r. That is incorrect.\n\n Therefore, to remove the left part (without leaving any unwanted tab) we must be at a position i such that i >= l. But if we are at i>=l, then the closure operation would remove from a to i-1, which includes [1, l-1] and also [l, i-1] if i>l. And we don't want to remove [l, i-1] because they are in [l, r]. So we must not be at i>l.\n\n Hence, the only safe position to close the left part is at l. Similarly, the only safe position to close the right part is at r.\n\n Therefore, we must be at l to close the left part and at r to close the right part.\n\n Now, consider if we are already at l (or at r) then the movement cost to get to the closure point is 0.\n\n So the plan:\n\n If l == 1 and r == n: 0 seconds.\n\n Else if l == 1: # then we only need to close the right part (if r != n)\n     Then we must get the cursor to r (if it's not already there). Then one closure.\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n Else if r == n: # then we only need to close the left part (if l != 1)\n     Then we must get the cursor to l (if it's not already there). Then one closure.\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n Else: both sides exist (l>1 and r<n)\n\n    We have two options:\n\n    Option 1: Go from pos to l, then to r, then close left and right (but note: we must close left first then right? Actually, we can close left first and then right, or right first and then left.\n\n    However, note: after closing left, the left boundary becomes l, and the right boundary is still n. Then we must move from l to r (to close the right part). Similarly, if we close right first, then the right boundary becomes r, and then we move from r to l.\n\n    But also, we can do:\n\n        Option A: Close left first: \n            Move from pos to l: abs(pos-l)\n            Close left: 1\n            Then move from l to r: abs(l-r)   [Note: since l<=r, this is r-l]\n            Then close right: 1\n            Total: abs(pos-l) + (r-l) + 2\n\n        Option B: Close right first:\n            Move from pos to r: abs(pos-r)\n            Close right: 1\n            Then move from r to l: abs(r-l)   [which is r-l, same as above]\n            Then close left: 1\n            Total: abs(pos-r) + (r-l) + 2\n\n    But wait, is there a possibility that we can avoid moving from l to r (or from r to l) by being smart?\n\n    However, note: to close the left part we must be at l, and to close the right part we must be at r. And we have two distinct positions (unless l==r). So we must at least go to one of them, and then the other.\n\n    But observe: if we are going to close both, we have to visit both l and r at least once. However, the order matters for the movement cost.\n\n    Actually, we can also consider: what if we do not necessarily go from the initial pos to the first closure point and then to the second? \n\n    Example: \n        Input: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n        According to the example, the answer is 5.\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n        Option A: \n            Move from 3 to 2: |3-2|=1\n            Close left: 1\n            Then move from 2 to 4: |2-4|=2\n            Close right: 1\n            Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        Option B:\n            Move from 3 to 4: |3-4|=1\n            Close right: 1\n            Then move from 4 to 2: |4-2|=2\n            Close left: 1\n            Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        But note: the example says 5, so that matches.\n\n        However, consider another example: \n            n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n        Then:\n            Option A: \n                Move 3->2: 1\n                Close left: 1\n                Move 2->4: 2\n                Close right: 1\n                Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n            Option B: \n                Move 3->4: 1\n                Close right: 1\n                Move 4->2: 2\n                Close left: 1\n                Total: 5.\n\n        But is there a better way? \n\n        What if we do:\n\n            Move from 3 to 2 (cost 1), then close left (cost 1) -> now the left is closed, and the remaining tabs are [2,5] (since n=5, and we closed [1,1]). Then we need to close the right part: from 5 down to 4? Actually, we need to leave [2,4]. Currently, we have [2,5] and we want to leave [2,4], so we must close the right part from 5 to 5 (only one tab). \n\n            Now, the current cursor is at 2. To close the right part, we must move the cursor to 4 (because we must be at 4 to close the right part from 4 to 5). So we move from 2 to 4: cost 2, then close right: cost 1. Total: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n        Alternatively, after closing the left part, the boundaries are [2,5]. Now, the move operation is defined by the current boundaries. From 2, we can move to 3 or 4 (because the left boundary is 2 and the right boundary is 5). So moving from 2 to 4 is allowed.\n\n        Another alternative: maybe we can close the right part from a different position? \n\n        However, to close the right part, we must be at a position i such that i>=4 (because the right part is from 5 to 5, and we need to close [i+1,5]. To remove exactly [5,5], we must have i=4 (then we remove [5,5]). If we were at 5, then we would remove [6,5] (which is empty) so that doesn't work. Therefore, we must be at 4.\n\n        Therefore, the above calculation is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if we do the closures in a different order and use the fact that after closing one side the boundaries change and we can move faster? Actually, the movement cost is defined by the absolute distance, and the boundaries don't change the absolute distance (they just limit the movement, but we are only concerned with the minimum number of seconds, and each move is one second regardless of the boundary). \n\n    Therefore, the two orders are symmetric and the cost is the same.\n\n    But wait, consider a different example: \n        n=10, pos=5, l=1, r=10 -> 0 seconds.\n\n        n=10, pos=5, l=1, r=9: only right part exists (r=9, so we must close from 10 to 10). Then we must move from 5 to 9 (cost 4) and then close the right (cost 1). Total 5.\n\n        n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9: both sides. Then we have two options:\n\n        Option A (left then right):\n            Move from 5 to 2: 3 seconds\n            Close left: 1\n            Then move from 2 to 9: 7 seconds\n            Close right: 1\n            Total: 3+1+7+1 = 12.\n\n        Option B (right then left):\n            Move from 5 to 9: 4 seconds\n            Close right: 1\n            Then move from 9 to 2: 7 seconds\n            Close left: 1\n            Total: 4+1+7+1 = 13.\n\n        But is there a better way?\n\n        What if we do:\n            First, close the left part? But to close the left part we must be at l=2. Then the left part is gone, and the remaining tabs are [2,10]. Then we need to close the right part from [10,10]. Now, from 2 we can move to 10 (which is 8 moves) and then close the right. Total: 3 (to 2) + 1 (close left) + 8 (to 10) + 1 (close right) = 13.\n\n        Alternatively, after closing the left part, we are at 2, and then we can move to 9 (the right boundary we need to close is 9, but actually the right closure requires being at 9 to close [10,10] (since the right boundary is now 10, and we need to remove [9+1,10] i.e., [10,10]). So yes, we must be at 9.\n\n        But wait, what if we don't move all the way to 9? Actually, to close the right part we must be at 9 (because we need to remove [10,10] and the closure operation from a position i removes [i+1, b]. We want to remove 10, so i must be 9 (then [10,10] is removed). If we are at 10, then we try to close the right and there is no tab to the right, so that doesn't remove anything. So we must be at 9.\n\n        So the above calculation is correct.\n\n    However, note: we don't necessarily have to go to the opposite end first. What if we move partially?\n\n    Consider: we are at 5. We want to close the left part (must be at 2) and the right part (must be at 9). We have to visit both 2 and 9. The minimal total movement is the minimal path that covers both 2 and 9 starting from 5. \n\n    We can break the journey into:\n\n        Option 1: Go from 5 to 2, then to 9: distance = |5-2| + |2-9|\n        Option 2: Go from 5 to 9, then to 2: distance = |5-9| + |9-2|\n\n    Then add 2 for the two closures.\n\n    So the total cost is min(|5-2|+|2-9|, |5-9|+|9-2|) + 2 = min(3+7, 4+7) + 2 = min(10,11) + 2 = 10+2 = 12.\n\n    But wait, in our previous calculation for Option A (left then right) we had 3+7+2 = 12, and for Option B we had 4+7+2 = 13. Why did we get 13 for Option B? Because we did |5-9| (which is 4) and then |9-2| (which is 7) and then two closures (2). So 4+7+2=13.\n\n    But note: the closure operations are done at the respective positions. However, we don't have to move from 9 to 2 after closing the right? Actually, no: after closing the right, we are at 9. Then we must move from 9 to 2 to close the left. So the movement is from 5 to 9 (4) then from 9 to 2 (7). So 11 movements and then two closures: 11+2=13.\n\n    But why did I think of the minimal path as 10? Because the minimal path that visits both 2 and 9 (without considering the order) is indeed 10 if we can choose the order arbitrarily? Actually, the minimal total distance to cover both 2 and 9 from 5 is:\n\n        If we go from 5 to 2 then to 9: 3 + 7 = 10.\n        If we go from 5 to 9 then to 2: 4 + 7 = 11.\n\n    So the minimal movement is 10. Then plus two closures: 12.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal cost for both sides is: \n        movement_cost = min( abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r), abs(pos-r) + abs(r-l) )   [Note: abs(l-r) is the same as abs(r-l)]\n        then add 2 for the two closures.\n\n    But wait, is that always the case? \n\n    In the first example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n        movement_cost = min(|3-2|+|2-4|, |3-4|+|4-2|) = min(1+2, 1+2) = 3, then 3+2=5 -> matches.\n\n    In the second example: n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9.\n        movement_cost = min(|5-2|+|2-9|, |5-9|+|9-2|) = min(3+7, 4+7)=min(10,11)=10, then 10+2=12.\n\n    However, note: after we close one side, the boundaries change. Does that affect the movement? \n\n    Actually, the problem states that the movement is defined by the current boundaries. But note: when we move, the boundaries are the current unclosed tabs. However, the movement cost is independent of the boundaries: each move is one second, and we can only move one tab at a time. The boundaries only limit the direction (we cannot go beyond the current left boundary or right boundary). \n\n    But when we are moving from one point to another, the minimal steps is the absolute difference, because we can always move within the current boundaries? \n\n    However, consider: \n        Initially, we have [1,10] and we are at 5. Then we move to 2 (which is within [1,10]). Then we close the left part, so the tabs [1,1] are closed. Now the boundaries are [2,10]. Then we move from 2 to 9: we can move from 2 to 3,4,...,9 (each step is one second). So the distance from 2 to 9 is 7, which is |2-9|.\n\n    Similarly, if we first move to 9 (from 5: 4 steps) and then from 9 to 2 (7 steps) is |9-2|.\n\n    Therefore, the boundaries do not change the minimal movement cost (because the movement is defined as moving one tab at a time, and the boundaries only restrict the available moves, but we are allowed to move through the entire current segment). \n\n    Therefore, the minimal movement is indeed the absolute difference.\n\n    So the solution:\n\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n        elif l == 1:\n            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n        elif r == n:\n            print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n        else:\n            # We have to close both sides.\n            option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n            # But note: we can do the closures in any order, but we must visit both l and r. The minimal total movement is the minimum of the two orders?\n            # Actually, we don't necessarily have to do one closure then the other without returning. The above two options are the two orders.\n\n            # However, note: the above two options are the same as:\n            #   Option1: go to l, then to r.\n            #   Option2: go to r, then to l.\n\n            # But wait: what if we do something else? For example, we go to l, then to r, then back to l? Not necessary.\n\n            # But note: the minimal movement to cover both l and r is the minimum of:\n            #   |pos - l| + |l - r|   (go from pos to l, then to r)\n            #   |pos - r| + |r - l|   (go from pos to r, then to l)\n\n            # However, we can also consider: \n            #   Go to l, then to r, but then we don't need to come back. The closure operations are done at l and r respectively.\n\n            # But note: the closure operation at l removes the left part, and then we are at l, then we move to r (which is allowed because the boundaries are [l, n] (after closing left) and then we close the right part at r.\n\n            # Similarly, for the other order.\n\n            # So the minimal total movement is the minimum of these two.\n\n            total_movement = min(option1, option2) - 2   # because the two closures account for 2, and the movement is the rest.\n\n            # Actually, we computed option1 and option2 including the closures. So we can just take the minimum of option1 and option2.\n\n            answer = min(option1, option2)\n            print(answer)\n\n    But wait, in the example above, we had two ways: one gives 12 and the other 13, so we choose 12.\n\n    However, note: the example n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4: \n        option1 = |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1+2+2 = 5.\n        option2 = |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1+2+2 = 5.\n\n    So we take min(5,5)=5.\n\n    Another example: n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9: \n        option1 = |5-2| + |2-9| + 2 = 3+7+2 = 12.\n        option2 = |5-9| + |9-2| + 2 = 4+7+2 = 13.\n        min(12,13)=12.\n\n    Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n        elif l == 1:\n            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n        elif r == n:\n            print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n        else:\n            print(min(abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2))\n\n    But wait: is there a possibility that we can close one side without moving to the boundary if we are already in the segment? \n\n    Actually, we must be at the boundary to close the side. \n\n    However, consider if the cursor is already at l (for the left part) or at r (for the right part). Then the movement cost to get to l is 0, and then we do the closure. Similarly for the other.\n\n    This is already covered.\n\n    But wait, what if the cursor is between l and r? \n\n    Example: n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9: the cursor is between 2 and 9.\n\n    The above formula works.\n\n    However, let's test the example from the problem:\n\n        Input: ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n        For \"6 3 2 4\": n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 -> both sides exist (l>1 and r<n). \n            option1 = |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1+2+2 = 5.\n            option2 = |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1+2+2 = 5 -> output 5.\n\n        For \"6 3 1 3\": n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3 -> only left part? Actually, l=1 so we only need to close the right part (if r != n). Here r=3 and n=6, so yes, only right part.\n            Then we do: abs(3-3) + 1 = 0+1 = 1 -> output 1.\n\n        For \"5 2 1 5\": n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5 -> nothing to close (l=1 and r=5) -> output 0.\n\n    But wait, the example input is given as three separate strings in the example, but the problem says the input is one line with four numbers.\n\n    We'll read the input as:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        n = int(data[0]); pos = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); r = int(data[3])\n\n    However, note: the example input format: \n        ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n    But the problem says: the only line of input contains four integer numbers.\n\n    So we assume one line.\n\n    Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"6 3 2 4\" -> 5 (correct)\n        Example 2: \"6 3 1 3\" -> 1 (correct)\n        Example 3: \"5 2 1 5\" -> 0 (correct)\n\n    However, wait: in the second example, the input is \"6 3 1 3\". \n        n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n        Condition: l==1 -> then we do: abs(pos - r) + 1 = abs(3-3)+1 = 0+1 = 1.\n\n    But the problem says: In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.\n\n    Why is that? Because the segment [1,3] is the desired one. Initially, there are tabs 1 to 6. We need to leave 1 to 3. The current cursor is at 3. To leave [1,3], we must close the right part (tabs 4,5,6). We can do that by being at 3 and closing the right part (which removes [4,6]). \n\n    So the condition for the right part is: we must be at r (which is 3) to close the right part (because the closure operation from 3 will remove [4,6]). \n\n    However, note: the problem says we can close the right part from any position i (as long as i>=r) but if we are at i>r, then we remove more (but we don't mind). But wait, the problem requires leaving [l, r] = [1,3]. If we are at i=4, then we close the right part: that would remove [5,6] (if the current boundaries are [1,6]), but then we are left with [1,4] which is not [1,3]. \n\n    Actually, the closure operation is defined as: from the current cursor i, we remove [i+1, b]. We want to remove [4,6]. So we must set i=3, then we remove [4,6]. \n\n    But note: the problem says the boundaries change after closure. Initially, the boundaries are [1,6]. After closing the right part from 3, the new right boundary becomes 3. \n\n    Therefore, we must be at r (which is 3) to close the right part (if we are at a position greater than r, say 4, then we remove [5,6] and leave [1,4] which is not desired). \n\n    So the condition for the right part is: we must be at r to close the right part (so that we remove exactly [r+1, n]). \n\n    Similarly, for the left part, we must be at l to close the left part (so that we remove exactly [1, l-1]).\n\n    Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if we are at a position i that is less than l? Then we cannot close the left part (because we would remove too little or the wrong part). Similarly, if we are at a position i that is greater than r, then we cannot close the right part (because we would remove too much or the wrong part). \n\n    But note: for the left part, we must be at l (so that the closure removes [1, l-1]) and leaves l. Similarly, for the right part, we must be at r (so that the closure removes [r+1, n] and leaves r). \n\n    However, consider the left part: if we are at a position i < l, then we can still close the left part? Actually, no: because the closure operation from i (which is <l) would remove [a, i-1] (and a=1). Then we remove [1, i-1]. But we want to remove [1, l-1]. Since i-1 < l-1, we don't remove enough. Then the remaining tabs are [i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing different scenarios based on the initial and target segments, considering the movement and closure operations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r] using the least number of operations. Each operation can either move the cursor left or right by one tab per second or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - If only the left part (tabs 1 to l-1) needs closing, move the cursor to l and perform one closure.\n   - If only the right part (tabs r+1 to n) needs closing, move the cursor to r and perform one closure.\n   - If both parts need closing, calculate the minimal path to visit both l and r (either left then right or right then left) and add two closure operations.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for each scenario and computing the minimal movement cost plus closure operations. The movement cost is the absolute difference between the current position and the target positions (l or r).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n    elif l_val == 1:\n        print(abs(pos - r_val) + 1)\n    elif r_val == n:\n        print(abs(pos - l_val) + 1)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of four integers: the number of tabs (n), the initial cursor position (pos), and the segment boundaries (l and r).\n2. **Special Cases**:\n   - If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (l=1 and r=n), output 0 since no operations are needed.\n   - If only the left part needs closing (l=1), compute the movement to r and add one closure operation.\n   - If only the right part needs closing (r=n), compute the movement to l and add one closure operation.\n3. **General Case**: Both left and right parts need closing. Calculate the minimal operations by considering two paths:\n   - Move from `pos` to `l`, then to `r`, and perform two closures.\n   - Move from `pos` to `r`, then to `l`, and perform two closures.\n   The minimal of these two values is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and computes the minimal operations by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
