    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Notice that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can only swap adjacent 0-1 and 1-2, we cannot change the relative order of 0's and 2's arbitrarily. However, note that 1 acts as an intermediary: \n We can move a 0 through a series of swaps past a 1 (but not a 2) and similarly we can move a 2 through a series of swaps past a 1 (but not a 0).\n\n Actually, note that we can have a 0 move leftward (or rightward) by swapping with 1s until it hits the beginning (or the other end). Similarly, a 2 can move through 1s but not through 0s.\n\n Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed unless they are separated by 1s which can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: we can also swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2 arbitrarily. So we can rearrange the 1s arbitrarily with respect to each other and with respect to the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s cannot pass each other (because there's no swap between 0 and 2).\n\n But wait: what if we have a sequence like \"012\"? \n   Initially: \"012\"\n   We can swap the middle 1 with the 0: becomes \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2? -> \"120\". Then we cannot go back from \"120\" to \"012\" because we don't have the 0 and 2 swap.\n\n However, note that we can also do:\n   \"012\" -> swap the 1 and 2: \"021\" is not allowed because we can only swap adjacent 1 and 2, but here the adjacent pair is \"12\", so we can swap to \"021\". Then we can swap the 0 and the 2? No, because 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So from \"021\", we can only swap the 0 and the 2 if they become adjacent? They are not.\n\n But wait, we can also consider moving the 0 first: \n   \"012\": swap the 0 and 1 (adjacent) -> \"102\". Then from \"102\", we can swap the 1 and 2? No, because the adjacent pairs are \"10\" and \"02\". The \"10\" can be swapped to \"01\", and the \"02\" cannot be swapped. So from \"102\" we can get to \"012\" again? Actually, we can swap the 1 and 0 again to go back to \"012\". \n\n However, note that the operation is bidirectional: swapping is allowed in both directions for adjacent 0-1 and 1-2.\n\n But the key is: we cannot swap 0 and 2. So the relative order of 0s and 2s must remain the same as originally? Not exactly: because we can have 1s moving arbitrarily. \n\n Actually, the problem is similar to having three types: \n   Type 0: only can be swapped with 1 (so 0 can be moved arbitrarily as long as we don't cross a 2 without a 1? Actually, we can use the 1s as stepping stones to bypass 2s? Let me think.\n\n Consider: We have two 0s and one 2, and one 1: \"0 1 0 2\"\n\n We want to bring the two 0s together and push the 2 to the end, but we cannot swap 0 and 2. So we can move the 0s to the left of the 2 by using the 1s. However, we cannot let a 0 jump over a 2 because there's no direct swap. But note that we can use multiple swaps:\n\n Example: \"0 1 0 2\"\n Step1: swap the first two: \"1 0 0 2\"\n Step2: swap the second and third: \"1 0 0 2\" -> wait, the third is 0 and fourth is 2: cannot swap. Alternatively, from \"1 0 0 2\", we can move the 1 (which is at the front) to the right? \n   Actually, from \"1 0 0 2\": \n     Swap the 1 and the next 0: \"0 1 0 2\" -> back.\n     Or from \"1 0 0 2\": we can swap the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', or between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that while we can freely rearrange the '1's among themselves and with respect to '0's and '2's, the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same. This is because there is no direct swap allowed between '0' and '2'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to minimize the lexicographical order of a ternary string composed of '0', '1', and '2' by performing specific adjacent swaps. Lexicographical order is determined by comparing strings from left to right, so our goal is to place the smallest characters ('0's) as far left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n2. **Key Insight**: Since '0's cannot be swapped directly with '2's, their relative positions must remain unchanged in the final string. However, '1's can be moved freely and can act as intermediaries to separate '0's and '2's. Therefore, the solution involves:\n   - Separating the original string into three parts: all '0's, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. But note that the relative order of '0's and '2's must be preserved.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The optimal solution can be derived by:\n   - Collecting all '0's, '1's, and '2's from the input string while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n   - Concatenating these collected characters in the order: all '0's (from the original), followed by all '1's (from the original), and then all '2's (from the original).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        elif char == '2':\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    result = ''.join(zeros) + ''.join(ones) + ''.join(twos)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Separating Characters**: The string is processed to separate '0's, '1's, and '2's into three different lists (`zeros`, `ones`, `twos`). This separation maintains the relative order of each character type as they appear in the original string.\n3. **Constructing Result**: The result string is constructed by concatenating the '0's list, followed by the '1's list, and then the '2's list. This ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0's are the smallest characters and are placed first, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n4. **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the constraints of the allowed swaps to determine the minimal lexicographical string without explicitly performing any swaps, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. The solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string, as it involves a single pass through the string to separate the characters and another pass to concatenate them.",
