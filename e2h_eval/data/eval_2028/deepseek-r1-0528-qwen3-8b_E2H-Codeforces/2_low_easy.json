Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters.\n Conditions for \"YES\":\n 1. On both diagonals (the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal) all letters are the same.\n 2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n Steps:\n - Read n.\n - Read the grid.\n\n Let the two diagonals be:\n   Main diagonal: positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n   Anti-diagonal: positions (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n Condition 1: Every character on the main diagonal must be the same, and every character on the anti-diagonal must be the same.\n Condition 2: The letter on the diagonals must be the same? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\" (so two sets) but they might be two different letters?\n However, the example: \n   Input: 3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n   This is 'YES'. Here the main diagonal is 'w','s','w' -> wait, but wait: actually the main diagonal is [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] -> 'w','s','w' -> not all same! \n\n Let me check the example again: \n   The example input is: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   The main diagonal: \n        row0: 'w'\n        row1: 's'\n        row2: 'w'\n\n   So that's not the same. Then how is it YES?\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n But in this example, the main diagonal has two 'w' and one 's', so not the same.\n\n However, wait: the example output is \"YES\". \n\n Let me reexamine the example:\n\n   The example input:\n\n      wsw\n      sws\n      wsw\n\n   The diagonals are:\n      Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w','s','w' -> not same.\n\n   Anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) -> 'w','s','w' -> same as main? no.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"both diagonals\", meaning two separate conditions? Or does it mean that the two diagonals together form an X? \n\n   Actually, the letter \"X\" has two diagonals: one from top-left to bottom-right, and one from top-right to bottom-left. In the example, the center is common to both diagonals.\n\n   However, the condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means:\n      For the main diagonal: all the letters must be the same.\n      For the anti-diagonal: all the letters must be the same.\n\n   In the example, the main diagonal is not all the same. So why is the answer YES?\n\n   Let me look at the example provided in the problem:\n\n   Example Input 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   Output: NO.\n\n   Example Input 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Output: YES.\n\n   Example Input 3:\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n   Output: NO.\n\n   Now, let me check the second example again:\n\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        n = 3\n        Line0: \"wsw\"\n        Line1: \"sws\"\n        Line2: \"wsw\"\n\n   The main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='w', grid[1][1]='s', grid[2][2]='w'] -> not all same.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   It does not say the two diagonals must have the same letter, but that each diagonal has the same letter. However, in the example, the main diagonal has two 'w' and one 's' -> which is not the same.\n\n   However, looking at the example, the center is 's'. The two diagonals are:\n\n        Main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> so the condition requires all the same. But 'w' != 's' -> fails.\n\n   Why is the answer YES then?\n\n   I think",

The main diagonal has two 'w's and one 's', so it's not uniform. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n    #\n    # After checking the official problem source or similar problems, I recall that sometimes the condition is that the entire diagonal must be the same letter, but in this case, the example input 2 does not meet that condition.\n    #\n    # However, the sample output for the second example is \"YES\".

This suggests that the problem might have a different definition of diagonals or there is a mistake in the example.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows the diagonals to have the same letter, but the example input 2 is intended to have the same letter in the corners and the center being different? Let me compare with the first example:\n    #\n    # Example Input 1 (NO):\n    #       5\n    #       xooox\n    #       oxoxo\n    #       soxoo\n    #       oxoxo\n    #       xooox\n    #\n    # Here, the main diagonal: ['x','o','x','o','x'] — not all same.

But the expected answer is YES.\n    #\n    # I suspect the problem intended that the two diagonals must have the same letter, and the non-diagonal letters must be another letter. However, the problem statement does not say the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n    #\n    # But wait, the problem says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n    #\n    # In example input 2, the non-diagonal letters are the middle of each side: \n    #       First row: 'o' (but there are no 'o's in the given example input 2! The example input 2 is:\n    #           wsw\n    #           sws\n    #           wsw\n    #       Let's break down the grid for input 2:\n    #         Row0: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #         Row1: 's', 'w', 's'\n    #         Row2: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #\n    #       Actually, the grid is:\n    #           w s w\n    #           s w s\n    #           w s w\n    #\n    #       Now, the diagonals are:\n    #           Main: [w, w, w] -> actually, wait, let's index properly:\n    #               (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> so main diagonal is all 'w'.\n    #           Anti-diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> all 'w'.\n    #\n    #       The non-diagonal positions:\n    #           (0,1)='s', (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s'\n    #       So all non-diagonal letters are 's', which is different from 'w'.\n    #\n    #       Therefore, the example input 2 satisfies the conditions.\n    #\n    #       I must have misread the example input 2 initially. The example input 2 is:\n    #           3\n    #           wsw\n    #           sws\n    #           wsw\n    #\n    #       But when parsed correctly, the grid is:\n    #           Row0: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #           Row1: 's', 'w', 's'\n    #           Row2: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #\n    #       This means the main diagonal is indeed all 'w' and the anti-diagonal is all 'w'. And the non-diagonal letters are all 's'.\n    #\n    #       My mistake was in the manual breakdown earlier. I thought the grid was:\n    #           w s w\n    #           s w s\n    #           w s w\n    #       Which is correct. And the diagonals are:\n    #           Main: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w -> same.\n    #           Anti: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w -> same.\n    #\n    #       So the corrected approach is:\n    #         1. Check all elements on the main diagonal (i, i) are the same.\n    #         2. Check all elements on the anti-diagonal (i, n-1-i) are the same.\n    #         3. Check that all elements not on these diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n    #\n    #       Now, let's proceed with the code accordingly.\n\n    # Correction: In the example input 2, the grid is:\n    #       w s w\n    #       s w s\n    #       w s w\n    #   So the main diagonal is (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> valid.\n    #   The anti-diagonal is (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> valid.\n    #   The other positions are (0,1)='s', (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s' -> all 's', which is different from 'w'.\n\n    # Now, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the condition fails. For example, if the main diagonal is 'a' and the anti-diagonal is 'b', then the non-diagonal letters must be some letter different from both 'a' and 'b'. But the problem says \"different from the letters on the diagonals\", meaning different from both if they are different.\n\n    # Steps:\n\n    # Step 1: Check if both diagonals are uniform.\n    if len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    diag_char = diag_char1\n    if diag_char != diag_char2:\n        diag_char = None  # We'll use the fact that the non-diagonal letter must be different from both\n\n    # Now, we need to check the non-diagonal part.\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n    # Now, check that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letters.\n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        # This means the grid is 1x1, but n>=3 so skip.\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        if diag_char1 != non_diag_letter and diag_char2 != non_diag_letter:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` and the grid of size `n x n`.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It checks if all characters on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: It ensures all characters not on the diagonals are identical and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, it prints \"YES\" if all conditions are met, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming the letter \"X\" on the given grid.",

However, looking at the sample test cases provided in the problem, the second example is given as \"YES\".\n    #\n    # Another possibility: the problem intends that the diagonals must have the same letter, but the example input 2 actually has the same letter in the center and the corners? \n    # In the example input 2, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] and the anti-diagonal is ['w','s','w']. The common letter in the center is 's'. The problem does not require the two diagonals to have the same letter, only that each diagonal has the same letter throughout.\n    #\n    # But wait, the example input 2 does not satisfy that each diagonal has the same letter. The main diagonal has two 'w's and one 's', so it's not uniform. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n    #\n    # After checking the official problem source or similar problems, I recall that sometimes the condition is that the entire diagonal must be the same letter, but in this case, the example input 2 does not meet that condition.\n    #\n    # However, the sample output for the second example is \"YES\". This indicates that my initial interpretation might be flawed.\n    #\n    # Let me re-read the problem: \n    #   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    #\n    # This means that for the main diagonal, every letter must be the same, and for the anti-diagonal, every letter must be the same. The example input 2 does not satisfy this because the main diagonal has 'w', 's', 'w' — not all same.\n    #\n    # But the sample output is \"YES\". This suggests that the problem might have a different definition of diagonals or there is a mistake in the example.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows the diagonals to have the same letter, but the example input 2 is intended to have the same letter in the corners and the center being different? Let me compare with the first example:\n    #\n    # Example Input 1 (NO):\n    #       5\n    #       xooox\n    #       oxoxo\n    #       soxoo\n    #       oxoxo\n    #       xooox\n    #\n    # Here, the main diagonal: ['x','o','x','o','x'] — not all same. The anti-diagonal: ['x','o','x','o','x'] — not all same.\n    #\n    # Example Input 2 (YES):\n    #       3\n    #       wsw\n    #       sws\n    #       wsw\n    #\n    # Now, if we consider the diagonals strictly, it should be NO. But the expected answer is YES.\n    #\n    # I suspect the problem intended that the two diagonals must have the same letter, and the non-diagonal letters must be another letter. However, the problem statement does not say the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n    #\n    # But wait, the problem says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n    #\n    # In example input 2, the non-diagonal letters are the middle of each side: \n    #       First row: 'o' (but there are no 'o's in the given example input 2! The example input 2 is:\n    #           wsw\n    #           sws\n    #           wsw\n    #       Let's break down the grid for input 2:\n    #         Row0: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #         Row1: 's', 'w', 's'\n    #         Row2: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #\n    #       Actually, the grid is:\n    #           w s w\n    #           s w s\n    #           w s w\n    #\n    #       Now, the diagonals are:\n    #           Main: [w, w, w] -> actually, wait, let's index properly:\n    #               (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> so main diagonal is all 'w'.\n    #           Anti-diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> all 'w'.\n    #\n    #       The non-diagonal positions:\n    #           (0,1)='s', (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s'\n    #       So all non-diagonal letters are 's', which is different from 'w'.\n    #\n    #       Therefore, the example input 2 satisfies the conditions.\n    #\n    #       I must have misread the example input 2 initially. The example input 2 is:\n    #           3\n    #           wsw\n    #           sws\n    #           wsw\n    #\n    #       But when parsed correctly, the grid is:\n    #           Row0: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #           Row1: 's', 'w', 's'\n    #           Row2: 'w', 's', 'w'\n    #\n    #       This means the main diagonal is indeed all 'w' and the anti-diagonal is all 'w'. And the non-diagonal letters are all 's'.\n    #\n    #       My mistake was in the manual breakdown earlier. I thought the grid was:\n    #           w s w\n    #           s w s\n    #           w s w\n    #       Which is correct. And the diagonals are:\n    #           Main: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w -> same.\n    #           Anti: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w -> same.\n    #\n    #       So the corrected approach is:\n    #         1. Check all elements on the main diagonal (i, i) are the same.\n    #         2. Check all elements on the anti-diagonal (i, n-1-i) are the same.\n    #         3. Check that all elements not on these diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n    #\n    #       Now, let's proceed with the code accordingly.\n\n    # Correction: In the example input 2, the grid is:\n    #       w s w\n    #       s w s\n    #       w s w\n    #   So the main diagonal is (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> valid.\n    #   The anti-diagonal is (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> valid.\n    #   The other positions are (0,1)='s', (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s' -> all 's', which is different from 'w'.\n\n    # Now, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the condition fails. For example, if the main diagonal is 'a' and the anti-diagonal is 'b', then the non-diagonal letters must be some letter different from both 'a' and 'b'. But the problem says \"different from the letters on the diagonals\", meaning different from both if they are different.\n\n    # Steps:\n\n    # Step 1: Check if both diagonals are uniform.\n    if len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    diag_char = diag_char1\n    if diag_char != diag_char2:\n        diag_char = None  # We'll use the fact that the non-diagonal letter must be different from both\n\n    # Now, we need to check the non-diagonal part.\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n    # Now, check that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letters.\n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        # This means the grid is 1x1, but n>=3 so skip.\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        if diag_char1 != non_diag_letter and diag_char2 != non_diag_letter:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
