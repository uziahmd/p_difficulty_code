They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has `2^n` teams. The string `s` describes the results for each phase (from the first phase to the nth phase) as follows:\n   - In phase i (0-indexed, so the first phase is index 0), if `s[i]` is '0', then the lower skilled team wins in every match of that phase.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', then the higher skilled team wins.\n\n We need to find all integers `x` (which are team skill levels) for which there exists a permutation `p` (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) such that the team with skill `x` wins the tournament.\n\n Note: The tournament structure is fixed: the initial bracket is fixed (the matches are predetermined: the first two teams play, next two, etc.). However, the permutation `p` assigns the skill levels arbitrarily to these team indices.\n\n Observation: Since the bracket is fixed, we can think of the tournament as a complete binary tree of height `n` (with `2^n` leaves). The games are played in rounds (phases) from the leaves up. Each phase `i` (0-indexed from the bottom) corresponds to the winners of the previous round being grouped again.\n\n How does the outcome depend on the permutation?\n The outcome of each game in a phase depends on the two teams playing and the rule (0 or 1) of that phase.\n\n Since the bracket is fixed, we can assign the team indices (from 0 to 2^n-1) to the leaves in order. Then, the winner of the tournament must \"win\" all the way from the leaf to the root.\n\n But note: the problem asks for which `x` (which is a number between 1 and 2^n) can be the champion.\n\n Alternate Insight: Instead of constructing a permutation, we can think about the necessary conditions for a team with skill `x` to win.\n\n However, note the following: the assignment of the numbers 1 to 2^n to the teams is arbitrary. So we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the fixed bracket.\n\n We can model the tournament as a binary tree. Let the leaves (in order) be assigned the numbers 1 to 2^n.\n\n The catch: the rule for each phase (i.e., at each level of the tree) is either:\n   - Phase i (starting from the first phase, which is the bottom-most? Actually the description says: first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then second phase has 2^(n-2) games, etc. So the first phase is the one with the most games, i.e., the first elimination round. This corresponds to the lowest level of the tree (closest to the leaves). The last phase (i = n-1) is the final with 1 game.\n\n In the example: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\"\n\n The tournament has 8 teams. The bracket:\n\n Round 0 (first phase): 4 games (matches 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8)\n Round 1: 2 games (match the winners of the first two matches and the winners of the next two)\n Round 2: 1 game (the final)\n\n The rule for round 0 is '1' (so higher skill wins), round 1 is '0' (lower skill wins), round 2 is '1' (higher skill wins).\n\n How can we determine the set of `x` that can be the champion?\n\n We can simulate the tournament backwards. Alternatively, we can use a recursive approach (like a segment tree) to determine the condition for a particular team to win.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea: We have a fixed bracket. Each match in the bracket has a result rule associated with its round (phase). The round index (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to the depth: the first round (round0) is the deepest (with the smallest index in the tree? Actually, the first round is the first elimination, so it's the deepest).\n\n We can assign the team index (from 0 to 2^n-1) to the leaves in increasing order (so the leftmost leaf is team0, then team1, ...). Then, the winner of the tournament must beat opponents in the subsequent rounds.\n\n However, note: the problem does not fix the labeling of the teams by their index. We are free to assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n What does it mean for a particular number `x` to be the champion?\n\n We must assign the numbers 1 to 2^n to the leaves. Then, the tournament proceeds according to the rules. The outcome is determined by the relative ordering of the numbers in",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible team skill levels (from 1 to 2^n) that can win a playoff tournament given the results of each phase (either '0' for lower skill wins or '1' for higher skill wins). The tournament structure is fixed, and the assignment of skill levels to teams is arbitrary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament involves `2^n` teams competing in a single-elimination format. Each phase (round) consists of a specific number of games, with the first phase having `2^(n-1)` games, the second `2^(n-2)`, and so on until the final round with one game. The outcome of each game in a phase depends on the skill levels of the two teams playing and the phase's result rule (either '0' or '1').\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team with skill level `x` to win the tournament, there must exist an assignment of all skill levels (1 to 2^n) to the teams such that `x` wins all its games in every phase according to the given rules. This involves checking if `x` can emerge as the winner by strategically placing higher or lower skill teams in the bracket.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a recursive approach to simulate the tournament. For each potential champion `x`, we check if it can win all its matches in each phase by ensuring that in phases where the higher skill wins ('1'), `x` must be the highest skill in its path, and in phases where the lower skill wins ('0'), `x` must be the lowest skill in its path. This is done by maintaining intervals of possible skill values that could lead `x` to victory.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each number from 1 to 2^n (which is up to 262,144 for n=18) and for each, performs a tournament simulation. The simulation involves processing each phase, adjusting the interval of skill values needed for `x` to win. The overall complexity is O(2^n * n), which is feasible given the constraint n â‰¤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n   # 2^n\n    \n    res = []\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        low_bound = 1\n        high_bound = total_teams\n        \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            rule_char = s[i]\n            remaining_games = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n            if remaining_games == 0:\n                break\n                \n            if rule_char == '1':\n                # Higher skill wins: so x must be in the top half of the current interval\n                if high_bound < x:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                else:\n                    new_low = high_bound + 1\n                    if new_low > total_teams:\n                        break\n                    low_bound = new_low\n            else:\n                # Lower skill wins: so x must be in the bottom half of the current interval\n                if low_bound > x:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                else:\n                    new_high = low_bound - 1\n                    if new_high < 1:\n                        break\n                    high_bound = new_high\n                    \n        if valid:\n            res.append(str(x))\n            \n    print(\" \".join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (number of phases) and a string `s` (result rules for each phase).\n2. **Initialization**: The total number of teams is calculated as `2^n`. An empty list `res` is initialized to store the winning team numbers.\n3. **Checking Each Team**: For each team skill level `x` from 1 to `2^n`:\n   - **Initial Interval**: The initial interval for `x` is set from 1 to `2^n`.\n   - **Phase Processing**: For each phase, based on the rule ('0' or '1'), adjust the interval:\n     - **Rule '1' (Higher skill wins)**: `x` must be in the upper half of the current interval. If not, `x` cannot win.\n     - **Rule '0' (Lower skill wins)**: `x` must be in the lower half of the current interval. If not, `x` cannot win.\n   - **Validation**: If `x` satisfies all phase conditions, it is added to the result list.\n4. **Output**: The valid team numbers are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each team's viability by leveraging interval adjustments based on phase rules, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
