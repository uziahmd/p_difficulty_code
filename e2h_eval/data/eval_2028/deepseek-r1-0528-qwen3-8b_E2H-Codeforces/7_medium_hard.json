The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (at least one step after the initial) such that:\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: Start with 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k vertices connected to the center. Then total vertices = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 now each get k new vertices? But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices. And we must do this at least once.\n\n However, note that the example for k=4 is the smallest snowflake. The example drawing likely shows:\n   Step0: 1 vertex (center)\n   Step1: center connects to 4 leaves -> total 5 vertices.\n   Step2: Each leaf (which has degree 1) then connects to 4 new ones -> so from each leaf we add 4, so 4*4=16 more, but wait: the example says the smallest possible for k=4, so maybe they stop at step2?\n\n But note the rule: \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning we must do the expansion at least once (so step1 is mandatory, and then step2 is also mandatory? Actually, the description says:\n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\n   Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n So actually, the process is:\n\n   Start: 1 vertex (step0)\n\n   Step1: We do the first expansion (from the center) -> we have 1 + k vertices.\n\n   Then, we must do at least one more expansion: meaning we take all the leaves (each has degree 1) and from each we add k new vertices. But note: after step1, the center has degree k, and the leaves have degree 1.\n\n   However, when we add the next layer, we are adding to the leaves. But then the new vertices will have degree 1 (if we don't do further steps). But the problem does not require to do infinitely many steps. We can stop after some number of layers.\n\n How many layers?\n\n   Let t be the total number of expansions (including the first). Then the snowflake has:\n\n     Layer0: 1 vertex (center)\n     Layer1: k vertices\n     Layer2: k * k vertices\n     ...\n     Layer i: k^i vertices\n\n   Then total vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\n   But note: the problem says we must do the expansion at least once (meaning t>=1). However, wait: the first expansion is the one that gives k vertices, then the second expansion (if done) gives k^2, etc.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" \n        Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   This implies that the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory and then we must do at least one expansion from the leaves. So we must have at least two layers? \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"This step\" (referring to the expansion from leaves) should be done at least once. But the first expansion is separate. So the entire process:\n\n        Step0: center (1 vertex)\n        Step1: add k from center -> total 1+k (this is the first expansion)\n        Then, we must do at least one expansion from the leaves (the leaves are the k vertices from step1). So we add k*k in the second expansion.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal snowflake (for any k>1) must have at least 1 + k + k^2 vertices.\n\n   But wait, what if we do only the first expansion? The problem says the second step (expanding the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is two: the center expansion and then one round of leaf expansion.\n\n   However, let me read the problem statement again: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   In the first expansion, we create k leaves (each with degree 1). Then the condition applies: we must do the expansion from leaves at least once. So we must do the second expansion.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal snowflake has at least 1 + k + k^2 vertices.\n\n   But wait, is that always true? What if k=2? Then minimal: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\n   However, consider the example input: \n        Input: 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 15, 255, 10101, 1000000000000000000\n\n   Output: NO, NO, NO, NO, YES, YES, YES, YES, NO\n\n   Let's check:\n\n      n=1: NO (minimal is 1+ k + k^2, which is at least 1+2+4=7, but wait: what if we consider t=0? The problem says the first expansion (from center) is mandatory, and then the expansion from leaves at least once. So we must have at least two expansions? Then n=1 is just the center, but the first expansion is mandatory. However, the problem says:\n\n        Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\n\n      So the first expansion is mandatory. But then we must do the leaf expansion at least once. So the minimal graph must have 1 (initial) + k (first expansion) + k*k (second expansion) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n      However, wait: the problem says \"This step [expanding the leaves] should be done at least once\", meaning we must do it at least once. So the first expansion (from center) is the first step, and then the leaf expansion is the second step (and we must do it at least once). So we have at least two expansions.\n\n      But then what about n=1? It's the center without any expansion. That is not allowed because the first expansion (adding k new vertices) is mandatory. So n=1 is invalid.\n\n      Similarly, n=2: requires k=1? but k>1. Also, if we do one expansion (k=?) then we have 1+k=2 -> k=1, which is not allowed. Also, we cannot stop at the first expansion because we must do the leaf expansion at least once. So even if we try to use t=1 (only the first expansion) then we don't satisfy the condition (we didn't do the leaf expansion). Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2 with k>=2, so minimal n=1+2+4=7.\n\n      However, the example output for n=6 is \"NO\", and n=13 is \"YES\". \n\n      Let's check n=13: \n          We need to find a k>1 and an integer t>=2 (since we must do the leaf expansion at least once, so at least two expansions) such that:\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = 13.\n\n      Alternatively, note that the problem allows stopping after the second expansion? Or more? Actually, the process can have any number of expansions (at least two). So the total number of vertices is the sum of a geometric series with base k and (t+1) terms (from exponent 0 to t) but note: the center is layer0, then layer1, ..., layer t.\n\n      Actually, the number of vertices is: \n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n      Now, note that we can have different numbers of layers (t>=1, but actually the center is layer0 and then we have two expansions: so the total layers of expansion (steps) is t+1? Actually, the center is step0, then step1 adds k, then step2 adds k^2, etc. So the total layers (including center) is t+1, and the total expansions (excluding center) is t.\n\n      But wait, the problem says we must do the leaf expansion at least once. The center expansion is the first expansion, and the leaf expansion is the second expansion. So we must have at least two expansions, meaning t>=2 (because the center expansion is the first, and then we do the leaf expansion as the second). \n\n      However, note: the problem does not specify the maximum number of expansions. So we can have:\n\n          t_expansions = 1: only the center expansion -> then n = 1 + k. But then we haven't done the leaf expansion (which must be done at least once) -> invalid.\n\n          t_expansions >= 2: then n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t, where t>=1 (because we have at least two expansions: center and one leaf expansion, so t_expansions=2 means two layers beyond the center? Actually, if we count:\n\n          After 0 expansions: 1 vertex.\n          After 1 expansion: 1 + k.\n          After 2 expansions: 1 + k + k^2.\n\n          So the number of expansions (steps) is 2, and the total layers (including center) is 3.\n\n      Therefore, we require:\n\n          n = (k^(m) - 1) / (k-1)   for some integer m>=3 (since two expansions give m=3: 1 + k + k^2 = (k^3-1)/(k-1)).\n\n      But wait, note: the formula for the geometric series is:\n\n          S_m = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1) = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n      Here, m is the number of terms. For two expansions (center expansion and one leaf expansion), we have three terms: m=3.\n\n      So we require n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1) for some integer k>=2 and integer m>=3.\n\n      However, note: we can also stop at more than two expansions. For example, three expansions would be m=4: 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n      Therefore, the problem reduces to: for a given n, does there exist integers k>=2 and m>=3 such that:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n      But note: we can also have m=2? Then n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. However, we said m>=3 (because two expansions correspond to three terms, so m=3). But wait, the two expansions (center and one leaf) gives m=3 (three terms). However, the equation for m=2 would be:\n\n          n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n\n      But the problem requires at least two expansions (so we must have the leaf expansion at least once). However, note that the leaf expansion is done on the leaves from the first expansion. But what if we consider the center expansion as the first expansion and the leaf expansion as the second expansion? Then the total number of expansions is two, and the total terms is three (m=3). But wait, the formula for the geometric series with m terms is (k^m-1)/(k-1). The two expansions (two steps) would then be:\n\n          Step0: 1\n          Step1: k\n          Step2: k^2\n\n          So total terms = 3, so m=3.\n\n      However, if we consider the possibility of having only one expansion (the center expansion) then m=2: 1+k. But that is not allowed because the leaf expansion must be done at least once. Therefore, m must be at least 3.\n\n      But wait, there is another interpretation: the problem says \"This step [expanding the leaves] should be done at least once\", meaning we must do the leaf expansion at least once. The center expansion is done exactly once (mandatory). Then we must do the leaf expansion at least once. Then the next step is the leaf expansion, and then we can choose to do more leaf expansions arbitrarily. So the total number of expansions (steps) is:\n\n          Step0: center\n          Step1: center expansion (mandatory)\n          Step2: first leaf expansion (mandatory)\n          Step3: second leaf expansion (optional)\n          ...\n\n      Therefore, the minimal number of expansions (steps) is 2 (step1 and step2) and then we can have more. So the total number of layers (including center) is at least 3.\n\n      Now, note that the formula for the total number of vertices is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t)\n\n      where t is the number of leaf expansions (which must be at least 1). Then the total number of terms is t+2 (the center and two expansions: center, first leaf expansion, and then the leaf expansions we did). Actually, the center expansion is the first expansion, and then we do t leaf expansions (each time expanding the leaves from the previous layer). So:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t+1)   ??? \n\n      Let me index the expansions:\n\n          Layer0: 1 (center) -> term0: k^0 = 1\n          Layer1: k (from center) -> term1: k^1\n          Layer2: k^2 (from the first leaf expansion) -> term2: k^2\n          Layer3: k^3 (from the second leaf expansion) -> term3: k^3\n\n      So if we do s leaf expansions, then the total layers is s+1 (including the center) and the exponents go from 0 to s+1? Actually, the center is at exponent0, then the first expansion (center) gives exponent1, and then the leaf expansions give exponents 2, 3, ....\n\n      But wait, the center expansion is not a leaf expansion. The leaf expansion is done on the leaves (which are the ones from the previous expansion). So:\n\n          After 0 leaf expansions: we have layers 0 and 1 -> n = 1 + k. (But this is invalid because we must do at least one leaf expansion.)\n\n          After 1 leaf expansion: we have layers 0,1,2 -> n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n          After 2 leaf expansions: we have layers 0,1,2,3 -> n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n      So the total number of terms is (leaf_expansion_count + 2). And the highest exponent is (leaf_expansion_count + 1). \n\n      Therefore, n = (k^(leaf_expansion_count+2) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n      And leaf_expansion_count >= 1, so the exponent (number of terms) is at least 3.\n\n      So the equation is: n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1) for some integer k>=2 and integer m>=3.\n\n      However, note: we could also consider the case when the center expansion is the first expansion and then we do exactly one leaf expansion (so m=3) or more.\n\n      But wait, what if we consider m=1? Then n = (k^1-1)/(k-1)=1 -> but k>=2, then (k-1)/(k-1)=1, but then the center alone? But the center alone is not allowed because the first expansion (adding k) is mandatory, and then the leaf expansion must be done at least once. So m=1 is not allowed.\n\n      Similarly, m=2: n = (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1. But this corresponds to only the center and the first expansion (without the leaf expansion). Since the leaf expansion is mandatory, m=2 is not allowed.\n\n      So we require m>=3.\n\n      Now, the problem: Given n (up to 10^18) and t test cases (up to 10^4), we need to check if there exists an integer k>=2 and integer m>=3 such that:\n\n          n*(k-1) = k^m - 1\n\n      Rearranged: k^m = n*(k-1) + 1.\n\n      How to check for n up to 10^18?\n\n      Note: m>=3, and k>=2.\n\n      We cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... because k might be very large. However, note that for fixed m, k must be at least 2, and the equation is:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1)+1\n\n      We can consider two cases:\n\n        Case 1: m=3 (the minimal case). Then we have:\n            k^3 = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        Case 2: m>=4.\n\n      But note: the value of k might be small (like 2,3,...) and m might be large, but the left side (k^m) grows very fast. However, note that n is up to 10^18, so we can consider:\n\n        If m=3: then k^3 = n*(k-1)+1. Then k^3 is roughly n*k, so k^2 ~ n. Then k ~ sqrt(n). Since n can be up to 10^18, k would be up to 10^9, which is too large to iterate.\n\n      Alternatively, we can fix m and solve for k. But m can be from 3 up to ...? \n\n      Note: the minimal value of k is 2. Then the left side is 2^m. The equation becomes:\n\n          2^m = n*(2-1)+1 = n+1\n\n      So for k=2, we require n+1 to be a power of two (with exponent at least 3). Then n = (a power of two) - 1.\n\n      Similarly, for k=3, we require:\n\n          3^m = n*(3-1)+1 = 2*n+1\n\n      Then n = (3^m - 1)/2.\n\n      How to iterate? \n\n      Observation: the equation is k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n      Rearranged: k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n      For a fixed m (at least 3) and k>=2, we can compute n. But we are given n and we want to know if there exists k and m.\n\n      We can iterate over m? But m can be large: since k>=2, then 2^m <= n*(k-1)+1. The maximum m: if k=2, then 2^m <= n+1, so m <= log2(n+1) ~ 60 (since 2^60 ~ 1e18). So m from 3 to about 60.\n\n      Then for each m from 3 to 60 (or until 2^m exceeds n*(max_k-1)+1, but we don't know k) we can try to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1)+1\n\n      Rearranged: k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n      We can consider k as a root of the equation. Since k>=2, we can try to solve for k by binary search? But note, the equation is exponential in k.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note that for fixed m, the equation is:\n\n          k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n      And we can try to solve for k by iterating k from 2 to ... but the k might be very large (for m=3, k is about cube root of n, which is 10^6 for n=10^18, which is acceptable for one m but we have 60 m's, then 60 * 10^6 is 60e6 which might be acceptable in C++ but in Python for 10^4 test cases? No, because 10^4 test cases * 60 * 10^6 operations is 60e9 * 10^4 = 600e12 operations, which is too slow.\n\n      We need a better approach.\n\n      Another idea: we can iterate over k for fixed m? But m is from 3 to about 60, and for each m, k must be at least 2 and at most ...?\n\n        From the equation: k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        For k=2: then 2^m = n+1 -> n = 2^m - 1.\n        For k=3: then 3^m = n*2+1 -> n = (3^m-1)//2.\n\n        But note: k must be an integer and the equation must hold.\n\n      However, we are given n. For each m from 3 to 60, we can compute the base k by:\n\n        We have: k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can rearrange to: k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n        But note: we can also think: for a fixed m, what k could satisfy? The left side is a polynomial of degree m. We are only interested in integer k>=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can solve for k in terms of n and m. Notice that for fixed m, the function f(k) = k^m is strictly increasing for k>=2, and the equation is:\n\n          k^m = n*k - n + 1\n\n        We can rearrange to: k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\n        But note: k must be an integer. We can try to find k by checking the bounds.\n\n        For a fixed m, what is the range of k?\n\n          Lower bound: k_min = 2.\n          Upper bound: k_max: we have k^m = n*k - n + 1. Since k^m grows faster than n*k, we can set:\n\n          k^m <= n*k   => k^(m-1) <= n   (if n*k is positive, which it is)\n\n          So k <= n^(1/(m-1))\n\n        But note: the equation is k^m = n*(k-1)+1. For k>=2, we have:\n\n          k^m < n*k   (since n*(k-1)+1 < n*k)   [because n*(k-1)+1 = n*k - n + 1, and for n>=1 and k>=2, we have n*k - n + 1 < n*k]\n\n        So k^m < n*k  => k^(m-1) < n.\n\n        Therefore, k < n^(1/(m-1)).\n\n        Since m>=3, then m-1>=2, so k < n^(1/2) for m=3, and even smaller for larger m.\n\n        Example: m=3, then k^2 < n, so k < sqrt(n). Since n can be up to 10^18, sqrt(n) is 10^9, which is too many to iterate for each m and each test case.\n\n      But note: we are iterating m from 3 to 60, and for each m we are going to iterate k from 2 to floor(n^(1/(m-1))). For m=3, we iterate k from 2 to about 10^9, and we have up to 60 m's per test case. Then for one test case, the inner loop would be 10^9 * 60, which is 60e9, which is too slow for one test case (and we have up to 10^4 test cases).\n\n      We need a different method.\n\n      Alternate Insight:\n\n        We know that the equation is: n = (k^m - 1)/(k-1)\n\n        This is the sum of a geometric series. For fixed n, we can consider:\n\n        Since m>=3, then k^m is the dominant term. We can try to factor the equation or consider the following:\n\n        Let d = k-1, then k = d+1, and the equation becomes:\n\n          n = ( (d+1)^m - 1 ) / d\n\n        Expand (d+1)^m using the binomial theorem:\n\n          (d+1)^m = C(m,0)*d^0 + C(m,1)*d^1 + ... + C(m,m)*d^m\n\n          Then (d+1)^m - 1 = C(m,1)*d + C(m,2)*d^2 + ... + C(m,m)*d^m\n\n          Then n = [C(m,1)*d + C(m,2)*d^2 + ... + C(m,m)*d^m] / d\n                  = C(m,1) + C(m,2)*d + ... + C(m,m)*d^(m-1)\n\n        Then n = m*d^0 + ... (but d>=1, and d=k-1>=1)\n\n        Since d divides the numerator, d divides (k^m-1). But we already have that.\n\n        However, we can also note that the equation must hold modulo d: \n\n          n = (k^m-1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)\n\n        And we know that k ≡ 1 (mod d). Then each term k^i ≡ 1 (mod d), so the sum is m mod d. Therefore:\n\n          n ≡ m (mod d)\n\n        But d = k-1, and k is at least 2 so d>=1.\n\n        Also, note that d divides (k^m-1) and we know k^m-1 = n*(k-1) = n*d.\n\n        But the above modular condition is: n ≡ m (mod d)  => n = m + q*d for some integer q.\n\n        This gives a relation between n, m, and d.\n\n        However, we are trying to find k (or d) and m. \n\n        We can try to iterate over m (from 3 to about 60) and then for each m, we know that d must divide (k^m-1) and also d = k-1, and k>=2. Moreover, from the equation:\n\n          n = (k^m-1)/(k-1)\n\n        We can express k in terms of d: k = d+1, then:\n\n          n = ( (d+1)^m - 1 ) / d\n\n        We can compute the right-hand side for d from 1 up to ...? \n\n        But note: d = k-1, and k>=2, so d>=1. Also, from earlier: k^m < n*k, and k=d+1, so:\n\n          (d+1)^m < n*(d+1)\n\n        => (d+1)^(m-1) < n.\n\n        So d+1 < n^(1/(m-1)), so d < n^(1/(m-1)) - 1.\n\n        For m=3: d < sqrt(n) - 1, which is about 10^9, too big to iterate.\n\n      We need to avoid iterating over d.\n\n      Let me change the perspective.\n\n      Since m is at most 60, we can iterate over m from 3 to 60, and for each m, we can solve for k by considering that k must be an integer and k>=2, and the equation:\n\n          k^m = n*(k-1)+1\n\n      We can rearrange:\n\n          k^m - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n      This is a polynomial equation. We can use binary search on k for fixed m.\n\n      Steps for fixed m and n:\n\n        We know k must satisfy: k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        Also, from the inequality: k^m < n*k, so k^(m-1) < n.\n\n        Then k < n^(1/(m-1))\n\n        We can set:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = min(10**18, int(round(n**(1/(m-1)))) + 100)   # But note: for m=3, n**(1/2) is about 10^9, which is acceptable for binary search? Because binary search from 2 to 10^9 takes about 30 iterations.\n\n        But wait, we have multiple m (from 3 to 60). For m=3, we do a binary search from 2 to about 10^9 (if n=10^18) which is 30 iterations. Then for m=4, the upper bound is n^(1/3) which is about 10^6, so 20 iterations. For m=5, n^(1/4) is about 10^4.5, so about 10^4.5, which is around 30000, so 15 iterations.\n\n        Then for each m from 3 to 60, we do a binary search (about 60 * (max_iterations) = 60 * 30 = 1800 iterations) per test case? But wait, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(m-1)), and we are doing a binary search for k in the range [2, upper_bound]. \n\n        However, note: the equation is k^m = n*(k-1)+1. We cannot simply use k^m < n*k to set the upper bound, but we can use:\n\n          k^m = n*k - n + 1  => k^(m-1) = n - (n - 1)/k.\n\n        But note: k>=2, so (n-1)/k < n/2, so k^(m-1) > n/2? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, we can set:\n\n          k^m < n*k   => k^(m-1) < n   (if k>0, n>0)\n\n        So k < n^(1/(m-1)).\n\n        Therefore, we can set:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 10   # But careful: n**(1/(m-1)) might not be an integer.\n\n        However, we must account for integer k. We can set high = min(10**18, int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 100) but note that k must be at least 2 and less than n^(1/(m-1)) (if n^(1/(m-1)) is fractional, then k_max = floor(n**(1/(m-1))).\n\n        But note: we are doing binary search for k in [2, high], and the condition is:\n\n          f(k) = k^m == n*(k-1)+1\n\n        However, k^m might be very large (for k near n^(1/(m-1)) and m=3, k^3 ~ n, which is 10^18, which is representable in Python as integer (since 10^18 is within the range of Python integers).\n\n        Steps for fixed (n, m):\n\n          low, high = 2, min(10**18, int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 100)   [But note: if m=3, then n**(1/2) is the square root, and we set high to about sqrt(n)+100, which is 10^9+100, which is acceptable for binary search? Actually, the number of iterations in binary search is O(log(sqrt(n))), which is about log2(10^9) ~ 30, so 30 iterations per m.\n\n        Then for each test case, we iterate m from 3 to 60 (about 58 values) and for each m we do a binary search (about 30 iterations) so 58*30 ~ 1740 iterations per test case.\n\n        Then for 10^4 test cases, 10^4 * 1740 = 17.4e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        However, note: the exponentiation and multiplication for k^m and n*k might be heavy for k up to 10^9 and m=3 (which is k^3, which is 10^27 for k=10^9, but wait: k_max = sqrt(n) ~ 10^9 for n=10^18, then k^3 = (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a very big number and might be slow to compute? But we are only doing 17.4e6 * (cost of one exponentiation and one multiplication) and each exponentiation for m=3 is a simple cube, but for m=60 we would need to compute k^60, which is astronomical even for k=2 (2^60 is about 1e18, but for k=3, 3^60 is huge). \n\n        Actually, for m>=4, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(m-1)), which for n=10^18 and m=4 is 10^18^(1/3)=10^6, then k^4 for k=10^6 is 10^24, which is acceptable in Python as integer, but we are doing 17.4e6 * (number of m's) but note: for each m, we do a binary search that tests about 30 values of k. However, the exponentiation for k^m for k=10^6 and m=4 is 10^24, which is a big integer but still doable. But note: the problem says n up to 10^18, and k is at most about 10^9 for m=3, so k^3 is 10^27 which is 1000 times 10^24, and 10^27 is still representable (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the arithmetic might be slow for such large numbers).\n\n        We must consider performance: 17.4e6 * (operations for one exponentiation) and the exponentiation for k^m for k=10^9 and m=3 is 10^27, which is a number with about 90 bits, and exponentiation for m=3 is just k*k*k, which is cheap. But for m=60, k^60 for k=2 is 2^60 which is about 1e18, which is acceptable. But for k=10^6 and m=60: that's (10^6)^60 = 10^360, which is too big to compute.\n\n        However, note: our upper bound for k is n^(1/(m-1)), and n=10^18, so for m=60, k < (10^18)^(1/59) which is about 10^(18/59) ~ 10^0.305, which is about 2.02. So for m=60, k is at most 2. Therefore, we can break early for large m? Actually, the upper bound for k is very small for large m.\n\n        How to compute the upper bound for k for each m?\n\n          k_upper = min(10**18, int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 100)\n\n        But for m=60, n**(1/59) is about 10^(18/59) which is about 10^0.305, so about 2.02, so k_upper=3 (if we add 100, then 103, but we set k_upper to the minimum between 10**18 and the computed value, but note: we are using real number exponentiation which might be imprecise for large exponents.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use logarithms to avoid very large numbers? \n\n        But note: we are only iterating m from 3 to 60, and for each m we set:\n\n          k_upper = min(10**18, int(n**(1/(m-1))) + 100)\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex, and each subsequent layer expands by connecting each leaf vertex (vertices with degree 1) to \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). The construction must include at least two expansion steps (the initial expansion from the center and one expansion from the leaves).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after \\( t \\) expansion steps (including the initial step) is given by the geometric series sum \\( S = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\). This sum can be rewritten as \\( S = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Here, \\( t \\) must be at least 1 (since the leaf expansion must be done at least once), making the minimal number of terms \\( m = t + 1 \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists integers \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \\). This equation can be rearranged to \\( k^m = n(k - 1) + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 3 to a maximum value where \\( k^m \\) exceeds \\( n \\times (k - 1) + 1 \\)). For each \\( m \\), perform a binary search on \\( k \\) to find if there exists an integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\) satisfying the equation. The binary search bounds are derived from \\( k < n^{1/(m-1)} \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each test case by checking up to 60 values of \\( m \\) (since \\( 2^{60} \\) is around \\( 10^{18} \\)), and for each \\( m \\), performs a binary search over \\( k \\) in logarithmic time relative to \\( n \\).
