He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with at least one string s of length n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n How can we approach?\n\n Observation:\n Since the string s has length n, we can consider that the prefixes and suffixes must overlap in a consistent way.\n\n Let's denote:\n   For a string t of length k (k from 1 to n-1) that is a prefix: then the first k characters of s is t.\n   For a string t of length k that is a suffix: then the last k characters of s is t.\n\n Additionally, for the same length k, the two strings (one prefix and one suffix) must be distinct? Actually, the problem says \"exactly two strings of each length\", so they are distinct? Not necessarily distinct in the sense that two different strings could be of same length? Actually, the input gives 2n-2 strings and for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings.\n\n However, note: it is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the strings by their length. For each length k (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings.\n\n 2. Now, we need to decide which one of the two for each length is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n 3. But consistency: Consider that the entire string s must be consistent. In particular, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must match at the overlapping part? Actually, they don't necessarily have to, because they are at the beginning and the end. However, the entire string s must be such that:\n      s[0:k] = prefix (if assigned as prefix)\n      s[n-k:n] = suffix (if assigned as suffix)\n\n 4. Moreover, we also have shorter prefixes and suffixes. For example, the prefix of length 1 must be the first character, and the suffix of length 1 must be the last character. Then the prefix of length 2 must start with the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last two.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can think: the entire string s is fixed once we assign the two sets (prefixes and suffixes). But note: we have two possibilities for each length. However, the problem does not require us to find the exact string, only to assign labels 'P' and 'S' to the 2n-2 input strings.\n\n 6. There is a catch: the problem states that if there are multiple answers, we can print any.\n\n 7. Another idea: we know that the entire string s must be of length n. The set of all prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with one s.\n\n 8. How to check consistency? We can try to build a candidate string s from the assignments. But there are two choices per length (n-1 lengths) so 2^(n-1) possibilities, which is too many for n up to 100.\n\n 9. We need a smarter way.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Note: The problem guarantees that there exists at least one string s of length n that has the given set of prefixes and suffixes (each length from 1 to n-1 has two strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix).\n\n Also, note that the set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent. One way to ensure consistency is to have:\n\n   Let P_k be the prefix of length k (if chosen) and S_k be the suffix of length k (if chosen). Then, for the entire string s to be consistent, we must have:\n\n      s[0:k] = P_k\n      s[n-k:n] = S_k\n\n   And for two different lengths, say k and j, we must have:\n\n      If k < j, then the prefix of length j must start with the prefix of length k (i.e., s[0:k] == s[0:j][0:k]).\n      Similarly, the suffix of length j must end with the suffix of length k (i.e., s[n-k:n] == s[n-j:n-k+?] -> actually, for the suffix, we have s[n-j:n] = S_j",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to assign each string correctly as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem provides `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. These strings must be split into prefixes and suffixes such that they form a consistent string `s` of length `n`. The key insight is that the first character of any prefix must match the last character of any suffix of the same length if they overlap in the middle of `s`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For strings of length 1, the first character of the prefix must equal the last character of the suffix. This is because in the resulting string `s`, the first and last characters must be consistent. For longer strings, the overlapping parts between prefixes and suffixes must match.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Group by Length**: First, group all input strings by their lengths. For each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), there are exactly two strings.\n   - **Determine Prefix-Suffix**: For each group (strings of the same length), compare the strings to decide which one is the prefix and which is the suffix. The decision is based on whether the first character of one string matches the last character of the other. If they match, the string with the matching first character is likely the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once to group them by length and then performs pairwise comparisons for each length group. Since there are `O(n)` groups and each group has a constant number of strings (up to 2), the overall complexity is linear with respect to the input size, making it efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n\n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        k = len(s)\n        if k not in groups:\n            groups[k] = []\n        groups[k].append(s)\n\n    result = []\n\n    for k, arr in groups.items():\n        if k == 1:\n            if arr[0][0] == arr[1][-1]:\n                result.append('P')\n                result.append('S')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n                result.append('P')\n        else:\n            a, b = arr\n            if a[0] == b[-1]:\n                result.append('P')\n                result.append('S')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n                result.append('P')\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, starting with the integer `n` (length of the string `s`). The next `2n-2` lines contain the strings to be analyzed.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where each key is a length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), and the value is a list of two strings of that length.\n3. **Determining Prefix/Suffix**: For each group (each length `k`), the algorithm checks if the first character of one string matches the last character of the other. If they match, the string with the matching first character is labeled 'P' (prefix), and the other 'S' (suffix). This ensures consistency in the overlapping parts of the string `s`.\n4. **Output**: The results for all strings are concatenated into a single string of 'P's and 'S's, which is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the problem's guarantees to determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by focusing on the critical overlapping characters between strings of the same length.",
