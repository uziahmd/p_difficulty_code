On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence is composed of two types: 1 and 2.\n\n Without reversing, the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but note that we can reverse a contiguous part.\n\n What does reversing do?\n It flips a contiguous segment. So, if we have [a, b, c] and we reverse [b, c] then it becomes [a, c, b].\n\n However, note that the entire sequence must be considered as a whole. The goal is to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: If there are no 1's, then the sequence is all 2's -> LNDS is n.\n Case 2: If there are no 2's, then the sequence is all 1's -> LNDS is n.\n\n Now, consider a mix.\n\n The idea is that the best LNDS we can get is at most n (the whole sequence). But sometimes we cannot get n because the original sequence has a mix and reversing might help to put all 1's together and then 2's together.\n\n Note: The reversal operation can only reverse one contiguous segment. Therefore, we can think of the final sequence as three parts:\n   - The left part (before the reversed segment) which is unchanged.\n   - The reversed segment (which was originally a contiguous segment, so after reversal, the order of elements in that segment is inverted).\n   - The right part (after the reversed segment) which is unchanged.\n\n However, note that the reversal operation can also be applied to the entire array, or a single element, or nothing.\n\n How can we approach?\n\n Since n <= 2000, we can try O(n^2) or similar.\n\n Let me consider:\n\n In the final sequence, the longest non-decreasing subsequence will be the maximum between:\n   - The number of 1's (if we can arrange so that we have a block of 1's and then a block of 2's, then the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is the total number of elements? Not necessarily, because we might have some 1's and 2's interleaved even after reversal.\n\n Actually, note: the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if we have some 1's (possibly zero) then only 2's. But wait, what if we have 1 and then 1 and then 2? That's still non-decreasing.\n\n However, the problem is that we are allowed only one reversal. \n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the array consists only of 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is just a sequence of 1's and then 2's. The length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire array is the total number of elements if the entire array is non-decreasing (i.e., all 1's then all 2's). Otherwise, it might be broken.\n\n But note: we are allowed one reversal. What effect does one reversal have?\n\n Example: \n   Original: [1, 2, 1, 2] -> reverse [2,3] (the middle two) -> [1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n How do we compute the maximum LNDS we can achieve?\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Reverse nothing. Then the LNDS is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the original array.\n\n Option 2: Reverse a contiguous segment.\n\n However, enumerating every contiguous segment and computing the LNDS for the entire array after reversal would be too expensive (O(n^2 * n log n)) because the LNDS for a sequence of length up to 2000 is O(n log n) with standard patience sorting, but n=2000 and we have O(n^2) segments, that is about 4e6 * 2000*log(2000) which is too slow.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Observation:\n\n The reversal operation is local. The entire array is split into three parts. The reversal flips the middle part. The entire sequence is:\n\n   [A][B][C]\n\n where B is reversed. The entire sequence is fixed, and we are only allowed one contiguous reversal.\n\n The entire sequence is built from 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in the new sequence is the maximum over the entire sequence of the count of consecutive 1's and 2's? Actually, note that the entire sequence must be non-decreasing, so we want to have as many",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous segment. The key observation here is that the optimal solution will always have all 1s followed by all 2s, or vice versa, but since the sequence must be non-decreasing, the optimal configuration is all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence can include any sequence of 1s followed by any sequence of 2s. The goal is to reverse a contiguous segment such that the entire sequence has all 1s followed by all 2s, maximizing the length of the LNDS.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal configuration is achieved when all 1s are moved to the left and all 2s to the right. The reversal operation allows us to flip any contiguous segment, which can help in aligning all 1s to the left and all 2s to the right.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Case 1**: If the entire sequence is already non-decreasing, the answer is the length of the sequence.\n   - **Case 2**: Otherwise, we consider reversing segments around each '2' that appears before a '1' in the original sequence. For each such '2', we calculate the number of consecutive 1s to its left and the number of consecutive 2s to its right. The potential LNDS after reversal would be the sum of these counts plus one (for the reversed element itself).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element once for each occurrence where a '2' precedes a '1', leading to an O(n^2) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if all(x == 1 for x in arr):\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    if all(x == 2 for x in arr):\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    total_ones = arr.count(1)\n    total_twos = arr.count(2)\n    \n    max_length = max(total_ones, total_twos) + 1\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            j = i\n            while j < n and arr[j] == 2:\n                j += 1\n            start_block = j\n            k = j\n            count_ones_left = 0\n            while i >= 0 and arr[i] == 1:\n                count_ones_left += 1\n                i -= 1\n                \n            count_twos_right = 0\n            temp = start_block + 1\n            while temp < n and arr[temp] == 2:\n                count_twos_right += 1\n                temp += 1\n                \n            candidate = count_ones_left + count_twos_right + 1\n            if candidate > max_length:\n                max_length = candidate\n                \n            i = start_block\n            \n        else:\n            i += 1\n            \n    print(max_length)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the entire sequence consists of 1s or 2s. In such cases, the answer is simply the length of the sequence since it is already non-decreasing.\n2. **Edge Handling**: The variable `max_length` is initialized to the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s plus one, representing the best possible scenario where all elements are either 1s or 2s with one element in between.\n3. **Traversal and Reversal Simulation**: The code traverses the sequence to find segments where a '2' is followed by a '1'. For each such segment, it calculates the number of consecutive 1s to the left and 2s to the right of the segment. The potential LNDS after reversing this segment is the sum of these counts plus one.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value obtained from all possible segments is printed as the result, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequence achievable after reversing any one contiguous segment.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking critical segments where the sequence order is disrupted, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
