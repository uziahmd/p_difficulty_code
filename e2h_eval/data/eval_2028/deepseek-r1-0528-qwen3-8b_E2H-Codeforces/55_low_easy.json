Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means:\n - '0' can be moved freely to the left (because we can swap 0 and 1, and then 1 and 2? Actually note: \n   However, note that we cannot swap 0 and 2. So the relative order of 0's and 2's is fixed unless there is a 1 in between.\n\n But note: \n   Operation 1: swap \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n   Operation 2: swap \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n What does this imply?\n We cannot move a '0' past a '2' without having a '1' to help? Actually, consider:\n\n Example: \"02\" -> we cannot swap. Similarly, we cannot move a '0' to the right of a '2' if there's no '1' in between?\n\n However, note that we can use multiple swaps. For example, to move a '0' from the right of a '2' to the left, we must have a '1' somewhere in between to help the '0' bypass the '2'. But wait, we cannot swap '0' and '2'. However, we can do:\n\n Example: \"012\"\n   We can swap the '0' and '1' to get \"102\", then swap the '0' and '2'? No, because after swapping the first two we have \"102\", and now we can only swap the last two if they are \"12\" or \"21\". Here we have \"02\" which we cannot swap.\n\n Alternatively, consider moving a '0' to the left through a sequence of ones and then a two? Actually, we cannot directly move 0 past 2, but we can move 0 past 1. Then, how about if we have a two in the way? \n\n Actually, note: we can also move the two backwards (swapping with ones) and then maybe create a path for the zero? \n\n However, let's analyze the relative movement:\n\n The operations allow us to independently sort the three types? Not exactly.\n\n Another approach: think of the graph of allowed swaps. Each character has an edge to the next if they are consecutive and one of the pairs: \"01\", \"10\", \"12\", \"21\". This is similar to having two independent cycles: \n   The zeros and ones can be arbitrarily rearranged (since swapping 0 and 1 is allowed, so zeros and ones can be moved arbitrarily relative to each other). Similarly, ones and twos can be arbitrarily rearranged. But zeros and twos cannot be swapped directly.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed by their initial positions, except that we can move ones arbitrarily and use them to separate zeros and twos? \n\n Actually, note: we can move zeros and ones arbitrarily, and ones and twos arbitrarily. So we can rearrange the entire string as long as the zeros and twos maintain their relative order (because there's no direct swap between zero and two, and any swap that moves a zero past a two would require moving the ones that are between them, but the zeros and twos themselves cannot cross each other without violating the adjacency swap rules).\n\n How to see: Consider that if we have a zero and a two, they cannot swap even if there is a one in between? Actually, we can use the ones to move the zero and two around, but note:\n\n Example: \"012\"\n   We can swap the first two: \"01\" -> \"10\", so we get \"102\".\n   Now we cannot swap the last two because they are \"02\" (which is not allowed). So the relative order of the zero and the two remains: originally the zero was before the two, and after the swap the zero is still before the two.\n\n Similarly, if we start with \"210\":\n   Swap the last two: \"10\" becomes \"01\", so we get \"201\". Now the two is still before the zero.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of zeros and twos must remain the same as in the original string.\n\n However, the ones can be rearranged arbitrarily with respect to zeros and twos, but note: the entire string is broken down into two independent groups: zeros and non-zeros (ones and twos). And within the non-zeros, we can rearrange the ones and twos arbitrarily? Actually, we can because we can swap ones and twos arbitrarily (the operation for \"12\" and \"21\").\n\n But wait: the zeros and ones can be swapped arbitrarily, and ones and twos can be swapped arbitrarily, so the entire set of zeros, ones, and twos can be rearranged arbitrarily except that the relative order of zeros and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that while '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, their relative positions must remain unchanged in the final string. However, '1's can be freely rearranged among themselves and can act as intermediaries to help position '0's and '2's optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the given ternary string into its lexicographically smallest form using only specific adjacent swaps. The critical insight is that '0's and '2's maintain their original relative order, but '1's can be placed anywhere. This means that in the final string, all '0's must appear before any '2's, with '1's interspersed in any order.\n2. **Intuition**: The lexicographically smallest string will have all '0's first, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. However, since '1's can be freely moved, they can be used to separate '0's and '2's. The challenge is to determine the optimal positions for '1's such that the overall string is minimized.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Separating the input string into three lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's.\n   - The final string will consist of all '0's followed by all '1's followed by all '2's. This arrangement ensures the lexicographically smallest result because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is efficient and handles the upper constraint of 10^5 characters effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    result = ''.join(zeros) + ''.join(ones) + ''.join(twsos)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n- **Categorization**: Each character in the string is categorized into one of three lists based on whether it is '0', '1', or '2'.\n- **String Construction**: The final string is constructed by concatenating the list of '0's, followed by the list of '1's, and then the list of '2's. This ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n- **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the constraints of the allowed swaps to determine the optimal arrangement of characters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
