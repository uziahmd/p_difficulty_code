    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three variables with ranges. The total number of triples without the triangle condition is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1). However, not all satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n We can use the following:\n\n For fixed x and y, we need z to satisfy:\n   z < x+y   (because x+y>z) and also C<=z<=D.\n\n But note: z must be at least C and at most D. Also, from the constraints, we know that x<=B, y>=B, so x<=y. Therefore, the condition for the triangle is only x+y>z.\n\n However, note that we also require that x+y>z, but since z is at least C and x+y might be as small as A+B (which is at least 2*A) and as large as B+C (which is at most 2*C). \n\n But note: we have a range for x, y, z. We cannot iterate over x, y, z because the ranges can be up to 500000.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix x and y, then the condition on z is:\n   z < x+y and C<=z<=D.\n\n So for fixed x and y, the valid z are in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n Then the number of z for fixed x,y is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, x+y-1) >= C]\n\n Then the answer would be: \n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} [max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)]\n\n But note: the inner sum is over y from B to C, and x from A to B. The direct double loop would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be as large as (500000)^2, which is 250e9, too slow.\n\n We need a more efficient method.\n\n Let's change the order:\n\n We note that for each fixed x, we can consider the pairs (y, z) such that y in [B, C] and z in [C, D] and z < x+y.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix y and x, but we want to avoid two loops.\n\n Another idea: fix the side z (from C to D) and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\n Then the total number of triangles is the sum for z from C to D of:\n   Count(z) = number of pairs (x,y) in [A,B] x [B,C] such that x+y > z.\n\n Then we can do:\n\n   ans = 0\n   for z in range(C, D+1):\n        count_z = count_pairs(A, B, C, z)   # pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C and x+y>z\n\n But note: the original condition was x<=y? Actually, the problem does not require x<=y<=z, but note the input conditions: \n   A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So indeed, we have x<=B<=y<=C<=z, so x<=y<=z. Therefore, the condition for the triangle is the same as x+y>z.\n\n Now, how to compute count_pairs(A, B, C, z) quickly?\n\n We have x in [A, B] and y in [B, C] and we require x+y > z.\n\n This is equivalent to y > z - x.\n\n Since y is at least B and at most C, we need:\n\n   y_min = max(B, floor(z-x)+1)   to C.\n\n But note: we can also think of it as:\n\n   For a fixed x, the condition on y is: y > z - x.\n\n   So the smallest y that works for this x is: y_low = max(B, floor(z-x)+1)\n\n   Then the count for x is: max(0, C - y_low + 1)   if y_low <= C, else 0.\n\n Then we can write:\n\n   count_z = 0\n   for x in range(A, B+1):\n        if x + B > z:   # then even the smallest y (which is B) satisfies y > z-x? Actually, we require x+y>z -> y>z-x.\n            # Actually, we need y > z-x. Since y_min = max(B, floor(z-x)+1) and then count is max(0, C - max(B, floor(z-x)+1) + 1)\n            # But note: if x+y>z, then y>z-x. So we can set y_min = max(B, floor(z-x)+1)\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the entire thing by iterating x from A to B and for each x, compute the lower bound for y.\n\n But then we are still iterating over x for each z, and z goes from C to D, and x from A to B. That would be (D-C+1)*(B-A+1) which is about (500000)^2, again 250e9.\n\n We need a better way.\n\n Instead, let's fix x and then consider the entire range of y. Or perhaps fix y and then x?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of counting pairs (x,y) with x+y>z and then subtract the ones that don't satisfy.\n\n But note: we can use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\n Let me reframe:\n\n We want to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\n This is the same as the total number of pairs (x,y) minus the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n Total pairs: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n Then, for a fixed z, we can compute the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n How to compute the number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z?\n\n We can fix x and then y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)] and also y>=B. So for each x, the condition is:\n   y <= min(C, z-x) and y>=B.\n\n So the number of y for a given x is: max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) provided that min(C, z-x) >= B, else 0.\n\n Then the total pairs with x+y<=z is:\n   Sum_{x=max(A, ceil(z-C))}^{min(B, z-B)} [min(C, z-x) - B + 1]   [but wait, actually x must be at least A and at most B, and for a fixed x, we require that z-x >= B (so that there exists y>=B) and also z-x>=B => x<=z-B, but note: we are counting pairs with x+y<=z, so x must be at least max(A, z-C)? Actually, no: the condition for x is: x<=B and y<=C, so x+y<=z implies x<=z-y, and since y>=B, then x<=z-B. Similarly, y<=z-x and y>=B, so we require that x>=ceil(z-C) because if x < ceil(z-C) then even the maximum y (C) would make x+y > z? Actually, no: we can have x very small and y very large, but then x+y might exceed z. \n\n Actually, we can break the condition for x: \n   For a fixed x, the condition for y is: y <= min(C, z-x) and y>=B. So if z-x < B, then there is no y (since y>=B). Otherwise, the number of y is min(C, z-x) - B + 1.\n\n So the total pairs with x+y<=z is:\n   Let x_min = A, x_max = min(B, z-B)   [because if x>z-B, then even the smallest y (B) would give x+y > z? Actually, no: if x>z-B then x+y >= x+B > (z-B)+B = z, so indeed x must be <= z-B. But note: if z-B is less than A, then no x satisfies.\n\n   Then for x from max(A, ?) to min(B, z-B): Actually, x must be at least A and at most min(B, floor(z - B))? Because if x is too small, then we can have y from B to min(C, z-x). But note: the constraint for x is just that x+y<=z, and y>=B, so x<=z-B. Also, we must have x>=A.\n\n   So the valid x are from A to min(B, z-B). Then for each x in that range, the condition for y is: y from B to min(C, z-x). The number of y is: max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1).\n\n   But note: if z-x < B, then min(C, z-x) < B, so the count is 0. But our x runs from A to min(B, z-B), so for x in that range, we have z-x >= z - min(B, z-B) >= z - (z-B) = B. So actually, for x in [A, min(B, z-B)], we have z-x >= B, so min(C, z-x) is at least B? Not necessarily: if C < z-x, then min(C, z-x)=C, and then we require C>=B (which is true because B<=C). \n\n   However, wait: if z-x >= B and also z-x >= C? No, we don't know. Actually, the condition for y is: y from B to min(C, z-x). So we must have min(C, z-x) >= B, which is true because:\n        If z-x >= C, then min(C, z-x)=C, and C>=B (given).\n        If z-x < C, then min(C, z-x)=z-x, and we require z-x>=B, which is true by the choice of x (x<=z-B => z-x>=B).\n\n   So for each x in [A, min(B, z-B)] (note: if z-B < A, then the interval is empty), the number of y is: min(C, z-x) - B + 1.\n\n Then:\n\n   count_leq = 0\n   low_x = A\n   high_x = min(B, z - B)   # because x+y>=x+B, and we require x+y<=z -> x<=z-B.\n\n   Then for x from low_x to high_x, add (min(C, z-x) - B + 1)\n\n But note: we can compute this without iterating over x by using some precomputation.\n\n However, we are going to iterate over z from C to D (about 500000 values) and for each z, we iterate over x from A to min(B, z-B). The total work might be too high.\n\n We need to optimize further.\n\n Let me try to change the order: instead of iterating over z, we can precompute an array for the entire range of x and y and then use two-dimensional prefix sums? \n\n Alternatively, note that the condition for (x,y) is independent of z? Actually, we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\n We can use the following:\n\n   Let F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n   Then the answer for the entire problem is: \n        ans = 0\n        for z in range(C, D+1):\n            count_z = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z)   # but wait, no: the total pairs is fixed, but note: the condition for a triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting for each z the pairs that form a triangle with that z? Actually, no: the original problem counts a triple (x,y,z) for each z. But note: the problem has fixed ranges for x,y,z. We are counting the triple (x,y,z) for each z independently. \n\n   However, note: the problem requires that x is in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. And the triangle condition is x+y>z. So for each z, we count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z. Then the total is the sum over z from C to D of [number of (x,y) such that x+y>z].\n\n   But note: the total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). However, we cannot use the total pairs because the condition x+y>z depends on z.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the entire set of pairs (x,y) and then use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to count the pairs with x+y>z. But note: the constraints are up to 500000.\n\n   Another idea: iterate over x and y once and then use a frequency array for the sum s=x+y, and then for each z, we can use the frequency array to get the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y>z.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute an array freq where for each s from A+B to B+C, we store the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s.\n\n        Note: x in [A,B], y in [B,C]. The minimum s is A+B, maximum is B+C.\n\n        How to compute freq[s]?\n            For a fixed s, x can be from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B). Then the number of x is: \n                low_x = max(A, s-C)\n                high_x = min(B, s-B)\n                if low_x <= high_x, then freq[s] = high_x - low_x + 1, else 0.\n\n        But note: we must ensure that y = s-x is in [B, C]. Since x is in [A,B] and y in [B,C], then for a fixed s, x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also y=s-x must be between B and C. But note: \n            y = s-x, and we require B<=s-x<=C.\n            => s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\n        So the condition for x is: max(A, s-C) <= x <= min(B, s-B).\n\n        Then we can compute freq[s] = max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)   [if the lower bound <= upper bound]\n\n   Step 2: Then we can create an array F for s from A+B to B+C: F[s] = freq[s] (the frequency of the sum s).\n\n   Step 3: Then, we want for each z (from C to D) the sum of F[s] for s from z+1 to (B+C) [because we require x+y>z, i.e., s>z].\n\n        Let G[z] = sum_{s=z+1}^{B+C} F[s]\n\n        Then the answer is: \n            ans = 0\n            for z from C to D:\n                ans += G[z]\n\n        But note: we cannot iterate over z from C to D and for each z iterate from s=z+1 to B+C because that would be O((B+C) * (D-C+1)) which is too high.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute a suffix sum array for the freq array.\n\n        Let S[s] = F[s] (for s from A+B to B+C), and 0 elsewhere.\n\n        Then let H[s] = S[s] + S[s+1] + ... + S[B+C]\n\n        Then G[z] = H[z+1]   [if we define H[s] as the suffix sum from s to B+C]\n\n        Then the answer is: \n            ans = sum_{z=C}^{D} H[z+1]\n\n        But note: we can also write:\n\n            ans = H[C+1] + H[C+2] + ... + H[D+1]\n\n        But note: when z=D, we use H[D+1] which is the sum from s=D+1 to B+C of F[s]. However, if D+1 > B+C, then H[D+1] = 0.\n\n        Actually, we can define H[s] for s from A+B to B+C, and then for s>B+C, H[s]=0.\n\n        Then the answer is the sum_{s=C+1}^{D+1} H[s]? \n\n        Wait: for each z, we are adding H[z+1]. Then the total is the sum_{z=C}^{D} H[z+1] = sum_{t=C+1}^{D+1} H[t] (where t=z+1).\n\n        But note: the condition for a pair (x,y) is that x+y must be at least A+B and at most B+C. So the frequencies are defined for s in [A+B, B+C]. Then for t from C+1 to D+1, if t is greater than B+C, then H[t]=0.\n\n        So we can compute:\n\n            ans = 0\n            for t in range(C+1, D+2):   # t from C+1 to D+1\n                ans += H[t]\n\n        However, note that the range of t is from C+1 to D+1, and D can be up to 500000, so we are iterating about 500000 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, how to compute H[s]? \n\n        We have an array F for s from A+B to B+C (let L = A+B, R = B+C). The length is at most 500000 (since B and C are up to 500000, so R-L+1 <= 500000).\n\n        Then we can compute H[s] for s from L to R, and then set H[s]=0 for s>R, and then for s<L, we don't care because we only use from C+1 to D+1 (and C>=B, so C+1>=B+1, and L=A+B, which might be less than C+1? Actually, A<=B, so A+B <= B+B <= B+C (since C>=B). So L = A+B, which might be less than C+1? \n\n        Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4. Then L=3, and C+1=4. Then we only consider t from 4 to 5.\n\n        But note: the pairs (x,y) have sums from 3 to 5 (since x in [1,2], y in [2,3]: \n            x=1, y=2 -> 3\n            x=1, y=3 -> 4\n            x=2, y=2 -> 4\n            x=2, y=3 -> 5\n\n        Then F[3]=1, F[4]=2, F[5]=1.\n\n        Then H[4] = F[4]+F[5] = 3, H[5]=F[5]=1.\n\n        Then the answer for the example: \n            z from 3 to 4 (since D=4, and z from C=3 to D=4)\n            For z=3: t=4 -> H[4]=3\n            For z=4: t=5 -> H[5]=1\n            Then total = 3+1 = 4, which matches the example.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read A, B, C, D.\n\n        Step 2: Let L = A+B, R = B+C.\n\n        Step 3: Create an array F of zeros for indices from L to R (we can use a dictionary or an array with offset).\n\n        Step 4: For s from L to R, we compute F[s] as follows:\n\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                F[s] = 0\n\n        But note: we must ensure that s-B is at least A? Actually, the condition for x is: x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]. \n\n        However, note: s-B might be less than A? Then low_x = max(A, s-C) and high_x = min(B, s-B) would be invalid if s-B < A. But then the condition low_x <= high_x fails.\n\n        Step 5: Build an array H for s from L to R (and beyond, but we only need from C+1 to D+1). We can build an array for s from L to R (or from 1 to max_val) but note the numbers are up to 10^6 (since A,B,C,D up to 500000, then s up to 1000000). \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the suffix sum for s from R down to L.\n\n        Let H[s] = F[s] + H[s+1]   (if we define H for s from R down to L, and then for s>R, H[s]=0)\n\n        But note: we need the suffix sum from s to R, so:\n\n            H[s] = F[s] + F[s+1] + ... + F[R]\n\n        Then the total for a given z is H[z+1].\n\n        Then the answer is: \n            ans = 0\n            for z from C to D:\n                t = z+1\n                if t >= L and t <= R:\n                    ans += H[t]\n                elif t > R:\n                    # then H[t] = 0, so nothing to add\n                    pass\n                elif t < L:\n                    # then F[t] is 0, and we haven't computed H for t, but note our H array is built for L to R. However, we can extend the array to cover from 1 to R (or from 1 to 1000000) but note: the problem says up to 500000, so s goes up to 1000000, but we are only building from L to R (which is 1000000 at most).\n\n            Actually, we can build an array for s from 1 to maybe max_val = max(R, D+1) (which is 1000000). But note: we have R = B+C <= 1000000, and D+1 <= 500001, so we can build an array for s from 1 to 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build H for s from 0 to MAX (say MAX=10**6) and then do:\n\n            H = [0]*(MAX+2)   # index from 0 to MAX+1\n\n            Then for s from R down to L:\n                H[s] = F[s] + H[s+1]\n\n            Then for z from C to D:\n                t = z+1\n                if t <= MAX:   # we have built H for t from 0 to MAX\n                    ans += H[t]\n\n        But note: we must set F[s] for s from L to R, and for s outside [L,R] we set F[s]=0.\n\n        However, the memory is 10**6 integers, which is acceptable.\n\n        Steps in code:\n\n            MAX_VAL = 1000000   # because R = B+C <= 500000+500000 = 1000000, and D+1 <= 500000+1 = 500001, so MAX_VAL=1000000 is enough.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Read A, B, C, D.\n\n            L = A+B\n            R = B+C\n\n            # We'll create an array F of zeros for indices from 0 to MAX_VAL (index 0 to MAX_VAL)\n            # But note: we only need from L to R, but we have to set F[s] for s in [L, R] and 0 elsewhere.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use an array of zeros of length MAX_VAL+1.\n\n            F = [0]*(MAX_VAL+2)   # index from 0 to MAX_VAL+1\n\n            # Then for s from L to R:\n            #   low_x = max(A, s-C)\n            #   high_x = min(B, s-B)\n            #   if low_x <= high_x:\n            #       F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n            #   else:\n            #       F[s] = 0\n\n            Then build H: \n                H = [0]*(MAX_VAL+2)\n                # Start from the maximum s (R) down to 0?\n                # But note: we only care about s from L to R, and for s>R, we set F[s]=0, and we want H[s] = F[s] + H[s+1] for s from R down to 0.\n\n            Then, for z from C to D:\n                t = z+1\n                if t <= MAX_VAL:\n                    ans += H[t]\n                else:\n                    # t > MAX_VAL, then H[t] = 0 (already set by initialization) so no need to do anything.\n                    pass\n\n            Print ans.\n\n        However, note: the above double loop for s from L to R is (R-L+1) which is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A>=1, C<=500000, so C-A+1 <= 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, the entire range of s is from A+B to B+C, which is (C-A+1) numbers, and each we do a constant time operation.\n\n        But note: the total memory is 10**6 integers, which is 10**6 * (size of int) ~ 8 MB, acceptable.\n\n        However, what if A+B is very large? Then we are setting a lot of zeros in the array F? Actually, we are creating an array of size 1000001, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the constraints say A,B,C,D up to 500000, so A+B can be as low as 2 (if A=1, B=1) and as high as 1000000 (if B=500000, then A+B=500000+500000=1000000). So we set F[s] for s from 2 to 1000000, but we are iterating from L to R, which is from 2 to 1000000 (if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then R=1000000). So the loop runs 1000000 - 2 + 1 = 999999 times, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, so A>=1, but B can be as large as 500000, so A+B can be as large as 1000000, but also as small as 2 (if A=1, B=1). \n\n        However, note: the example with A=1, B=1, then L=2, R=1+C (and C>=B=1, so C>=1). Then we iterate from 2 to 1+C (which is at most 500001). \n\n        But worst-case: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then we iterate from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 iterations, acceptable.\n\n        However, the above method for computing F[s] for s from L to R:\n\n            for s in range(L, R+1):\n                low_x = max(A, s - C)\n                high_x = min(B, s - B)\n                if low_x <= high_x:\n                    F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n                else:\n                    F[s] = 0\n\n        But wait: the condition for y is that y = s-x must be in [B, C]. However, note that we are using the condition that x is in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\n        Why s-C? Because y = s-x <= C -> x>=s-C.\n        Why s-B? Because y = s-x >= B -> x<=s-B.\n\n        And also x must be in [A, B]. So the intersection is [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Then we build the suffix sum array H from R down to 0.\n\n        Then we sum H[z+1] for z from C to D.\n\n        Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n            L = 1+2 = 3, R = 2+3 = 5.\n\n            s from 3 to 5:\n\n            s=3:\n                low_x = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n                high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n                F[3] = 1-1+1 = 1.\n\n            s=4:\n                low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n                high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n                F[4] = 2-1+1 = 2.\n\n            s=5:\n                low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n                high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n                F[5] = 2-2+1=1.\n\n            Then F[3]=1, F[4]=2, F[5]=1.\n\n            Build H from s=5 down to 0:\n\n                H[5] = F[5] + H[6] = 1 + 0 = 1.\n                H[4] = F[4] + H[5] = 2+1 = 3.\n                H[3] = F[3] + H[4] = 1+3 = 4.\n\n            Then for z from 3 to 4:\n                z=3: t=4 -> H[4]=3\n                z=4: t=5 -> H[5]=1\n                ans = 3+1 = 4.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" gives output 3.\n\n        Let me test with A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n        Conditions: x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (only y=2), z in [2,5].\n\n        Then the triangles: \n            x+y>z -> 1+2=3>z, so z<3 -> z=2 (but z>=2 and z<=5, so z=2: then 3>2 -> valid; z=3,4,5: 3<=3 -> not valid for z=3, and for z>=3, 3<=z -> not valid.\n\n            So only z=2 is valid.\n\n            Then the triangles: (1,2,2) and (2,2,2) -> two triangles? \n\n        Wait, the example output is 3.\n\n        Let me read the example: Input \"1 2 2 5\", Output \"3\".\n\n        The example says: In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides (1, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 3).\n\n        So we missed (2,2,3). But wait: (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> yes.\n\n        So why did I say only z=2? Because I considered only z from C to D, and C=2, so z from 2 to 5. But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z.\n\n        For (2,2,3): x+y=4>3 -> valid.\n\n        So we have:\n            z=2: (1,2,2) and (2,2,2) -> two triangles.\n            z=3: (2,2,3) -> one triangle.\n            z=4: no triangle because 4>=4, so 2+2=4 is not >4 -> degenerate, not allowed.\n            z=5: no.\n\n        So total 3.\n\n        Now, let's compute with our method:\n\n            A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n            L = 1+2=3, R = 2+2=4.\n\n            s from 3 to 4:\n\n            s=3:\n                low_x = max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n                high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n                F[3]=1.\n\n            s=4:\n                low_x = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n                high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n                F[4]=1.\n\n            Then F[3]=1, F[4]=1.\n\n            Build H from s=4 down to 0:\n\n                H[4]=F[4]+H[5]=1+0=1.\n                H[3]=F[3]+H[4]=1+1=2.\n\n            Then for z from 2 to 5 (since C=2, D=5):\n\n                z=2: t=3 -> H[3]=2\n                z=3: t=4 -> H[4]=1\n                z=4: t=5 -> 0\n                z=5: t=6 -> 0\n\n            Then ans = 2+1 = 3.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        But wait: in the above, for s=3: the pairs are (x,y) such that x+y=3. \n            x in [1,2] and y in [2,2]. Then (1,2) -> 1+2=3, and (2,2)=4, so only (1,2) gives s=3.\n\n        Then for z=2: we require x+y>2. The pairs (x,y) are (1,2) and (2,2). \n            (1,2): 3>2 -> valid.\n            (2,2): 4>2 -> valid.\n\n        So for z=2, we should count two pairs, but our F[3] and F[4] are set for the entire set of pairs. \n\n        Then H[3] = F[3]+F[4]+...+F[4] (since R=4) = F[3]+F[4] = 1+1=2.\n\n        Then for z=2: we use H[3] (because t=3) and that is 2.\n\n        Then for z=3: we use H[4] (t=4) which is F[4]=1.\n\n        Then for z=4: H[5]=0.\n\n        Then total 3.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the triangle is that the triple (x,y,z) must satisfy the triangle condition. In our method, we are counting the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z. \n\n        But note: the condition is independent of the fixed z. \n\n        However, the example also includes the pair (2,2) for z=2 and z=3. \n\n        So the method is correct.\n\n        But wait: why did we get two pairs for z=2? \n            Our F array counts the pairs (x,y) by their sum. Then the condition for a fixed z is that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, the most stringent condition is \\(x + y > z\\) since \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). The key condition is \\(x + y > z\\) for each triple.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). The total number of valid triangles is the sum of these counts over all \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: First, compute a frequency array \\(F\\) where \\(F[s]\\) is the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\). This involves iterating over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\) and using mathematical bounds to determine valid \\(x\\) values for each \\(s\\).\n   - **Suffix Sum Array**: Construct a suffix sum array \\(H\\) from \\(F\\) where \\(H[s]\\) is the sum of all \\(F[t]\\) for \\(t \\geq s\\). This allows efficient computation of the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\(x + y > z\\) by simply looking up \\(H[z + 1]\\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently computes the solution in \\(O(\\text{MAX\\_VAL})\\) time, where \\(\\text{MAX\\_VAL}\\) is the maximum possible sum \\(B + C\\) (up to \\(10^6\\)), which is feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    L = A + B\n    R = B + C\n    MAX_VAL = 1000000\n    \n    F = [0] * (MAX_VAL + 2)\n    \n    for s in range(L, R + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n    \n    H = [0] * (MAX_VAL + 2)\n    for s in range(R, -1, -1):\n        H[s] = F[s] + H[s + 1]\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        t = z + 1\n        if t <= MAX_VAL:\n            ans += H[t]\n    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) read from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Array \\(F\\)**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), compute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\). This is done by determining the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy the conditions \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\) for each \\(s\\).\n3. **Suffix Sum Array \\(H\\)**: The array \\(H\\) is built from \\(F\\) such that \\(H[s]\\) contains the sum of all frequencies \\(F[t]\\) for \\(t \\geq s\\). This allows quick lookup of the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\(x + y > z\\) by accessing \\(H[z + 1]\\).\n4. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), add \\(H[z + 1]\\) to the answer, which gives the count of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for that \\(z\\).\n5. **Output**: The total count of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights and prefix sums to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
