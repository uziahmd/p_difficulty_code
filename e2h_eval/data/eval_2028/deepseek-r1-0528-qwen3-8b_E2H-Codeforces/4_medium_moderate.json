The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Each round: \n   - If A[i] vs B[j] is a win for A, then Polycarpus loses and gets a red spot.\n   - If A[i] vs B[j] is a win for B, then Nikephoros loses and gets a red spot.\n   - Otherwise, draw.\n\n But note: the sequences are cyclic. So we have two sequences A (length m) and B (length k).\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate each round.\n\n Instead, we can break down the problem:\n\n Let the rounds be from 0 to n-1.\n\n For round i (0-indexed):\n   - The character from A is A[(i * m + start_index) % m] but actually we start at index0 for both, so:\n        a_index = (i) % m   [if we were to use just modulo, but wait: we cycle through the entire sequence]\n   - Similarly for B: b_index = (i) % k\n\n However, note that the sequences are independent and we have two cycles.\n\n We can consider the rounds as being grouped by the pairs (a_index, b_index) which repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds? \n But note: the indices for A and B are determined independently by the round index i.\n\n Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. However, note that the round index i is used for both: \n   a_index = i % m\n   b_index = i % k\n\n The pair (a_index, b_index) will repeat with period T = LCM(m, k). \n\n But note: the round index i runs from 0 to n-1, so we can break the n rounds into cycles of length T.\n\n However, n can be up to 2e9 and m,k up to 1000, so T might be up to 1000*1000 (which is 1e6) and then we have 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000 cycles. \n But 2000 * (number of distinct states in one cycle) is acceptable? Actually, we don't need to iterate 2e9 rounds, but we can compute the outcome for one full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles and then add the remaining rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the outcome for each pair (a, b) where a in A and b in B. \n    We know the rules:\n        Rock ('R'): beats Scissors ('S')\n        Scissors ('S'): beats Paper ('P')\n        Paper ('P'): beats Rock ('R')\n\n    So for a given (a, b):\n        if a == b: draw -> no red spot for either.\n        else:\n            if (a, b) is (R, S), (S, P), (P, R) then a wins -> so a beats b, meaning the loser is b's side: so Polycarpus (who uses B) loses if a wins? \n            Actually, let's clarify:\n\n            In the problem: \n                \"the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch\"\n\n            So:\n                If A wins: then Polycarpus (B) loses -> so Nikephoros does not get a red spot, Polycarpus does.\n                If B wins: then Nikephoros (A) loses -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot, Polycarpus does not.\n\n    Therefore, for a round:\n        - If A[i] beats B[i]: then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n        - If B[i] beats A[i]: then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n 2. We want to count:\n        total_red_spots_Nikephoros = number of rounds where B[i] beats A[i]\n        total_red_spots_Polycarpus = number of rounds where A[i] beats B[i]\n\n 3. We can precompute a list of outcomes for one full cycle of T = LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, note that the rounds are determined by the index i (from 0 to n-1) and the state is (i mod m, i mod k). \n\n    However, note: the same pair (a_index, b_index) might occur multiple times in the cycle? Actually, the cycle of (i mod m, i mod k) has length T = LCM(m,k). \n\n    But note: the same (a_index, b_index) might appear only once per cycle? Actually, by definition, the set of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 forms a complete residue system modulo m and k, so each pair (x,y) with 0<=x<m and 0<=y<k appears exactly once in the cycle? Not exactly: the condition for covering all pairs is that T is the least common multiple, but the pairs (i mod m, i mod k) do form a cycle of length T and each pair (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? Actually, no. The standard result is that the map i -> (i mod m, i mod k) has period T = LCM(m,k) and within one period, each pair (x,y) that satisfies x ≡ y (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k) appears exactly g times? \n\n    Actually, we don't need to worry about that. We can simply consider the entire set of pairs (x,y) that occur in the first T rounds. However, T might be very large (up to 1000*1000 = 1e6) and then n could be 2e9, so we can break n into:\n\n        num_cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n    Then, we can precompute an array for one cycle: \n\n        Let F(x, y) = 1 if (x,y) is a winning pair for A (so A beats B) and 0 otherwise for Polycarpus's red spot.\n        And G(x, y) = 1 if (x,y) is a winning pair for B (so B beats A) and 0 otherwise for Nikephoros's red spot.\n\n    But note: we cannot have both F and G being 1 at the same time, and if it's a draw then both 0.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        For a pair (a_char, b_char):\n            if a_char == b_char: (0,0)\n            else:\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    then (0,1)   # because a_char wins -> so B loses (Polycarpus gets 1 red spot) and A doesn't, so Nikephoros gets 0.\n                elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    then (1,0)   # because b_char wins -> so A loses (Nikephoros gets 1) and B doesn't.\n\n    However, note: the condition above is symmetric. Alternatively, we can define a function:\n\n        def outcome(a, b):\n            if a == b:\n                return (0, 0)\n            # Check if a beats b\n            if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n                return (0, 1)   # (Nikephoros_red, Polycarpus_red) -> here, Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses (1 red spot for Polycarpus)\n            else:\n                return (1, 0)   # B wins, so Nikephoros loses (1 red spot for Nikephoros)\n\n    But wait: the problem says:\n        \"the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch\"\n\n    So if A wins, then Polycarpus (the loser) gets a red spot. \n    If B wins, then Nikephoros (the loser) gets a red spot.\n\n    So the tuple (Nikephoros_red, Polycarpus_red) for a round is:\n        (1,0) if B wins (because Nikephoros is the loser)\n        (0,1) if A wins (because Polycarpus is the loser)\n        (0,0) if draw.\n\n 4. Now, the challenge: we have two sequences A and B, and we are going to use the round index i to determine:\n        a_index = i % m\n        b_index = i % k\n\n    Then the character for A is A[a_index] and for B is B[b_index].\n\n    Then we get outcome = outcome(A[a_index], B[b_index])\n\n 5. We need to count for all i from 0 to n-1.\n\n    We can break the n rounds into cycles of length T = LCM(m,k). However, note: the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds.\n\n    But note: the mapping from i to (a_index, b_index) is periodic with period T. And the outcome for (a_index, b_index) depends on the characters at those indices.\n\n    However, the same (a_index, b_index) always gives the same outcome.\n\n    Therefore, we can precompute an array for one full cycle of length T:\n\n        Let T = LCM(m, k)   [we can compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)]\n\n        But note: we don't need to build an array of length T (which can be up to 1e6) for each test case? Actually, 1e6 is acceptable because m,k <= 1000, so T <= 1000000, and we have at most 1000*1000 = 1e6 pairs. But note: the pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 are T pairs. However, we cannot iterate 1e6 for each test case if there are many test cases? But the problem reads one test case.\n\n    Steps for one test case:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then string A, then string B.\n\n        Step 2: Precompute the GCD of m and k, then T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        Step 3: If n <= T, then we can simulate the n rounds. But n can be up to 2e9, and T can be up to 1e6, so simulating 2e9 rounds is not feasible.\n\n        Alternative: we break n into cycles.\n\n        But note: T is the period of the state (i mod m, i mod k). The outcomes for each state (a_index, b_index) are fixed. So we can:\n\n            Precompute an array `cycle` of length T (which is the period) that holds the outcome (count_nike, count_poly) for each i in [0, T-1].\n\n            Then, the total outcomes for n rounds is:\n\n                full_cycles = n // T\n                rem = n % T\n\n                total_nike = full_cycles * (sum of nike_red for one cycle) + (sum of nike_red for the first rem rounds)\n                total_poly = full_cycles * (sum of poly_red for one cycle) + (sum of poly_red for the first rem rounds)\n\n        However, building an array of length T (which is up to 1000000) is acceptable because 1000000 is about 1e6, which is acceptable in Python if done once.\n\n        But note: we don't need to build an array for the entire T if we can compute the frequency of each (a_index, b_index) in one cycle? Actually, the cycle T is defined by the residues, and the residues (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 are all distinct? Actually, yes: the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that for modulus m and k, the system of congruences x ≡ a (mod m) and x ≡ b (mod k) has a solution modulo T if and only if a ≡ b (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k). However, in our case, the residues are consecutive integers. Actually, the set of residues (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 is the set of all pairs (x,y) such that x runs from 0 to m-1 and y runs from 0 to k-1, but not independently: they must satisfy that x and y are consistent with being the same i modulo g. However, note that the set of i from 0 to T-1 covers all residues modulo m and modulo k, and the mapping is bijective? Actually, the number of distinct pairs is T, and T is the LCM, so the set of pairs is the entire set of pairs (x,y) that are congruent modulo g (where g=gcd(m,k)) but wait, actually the condition is that the residues must be compatible. However, the standard fact is that the map i -> (i mod m, i mod k) is periodic with period T and the image is the set of pairs (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g) (with g = gcd(m,k)), and the number of distinct pairs is T. But note: the condition is necessary and sufficient, and the map is bijective from Z_T to the set of pairs (x,y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and x ≡ y (mod g). However, the total number of pairs that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g) is (m * k) / T * T? Actually, no, we have exactly T pairs.\n\n        But note: we can compute the outcome for each distinct pair (x,y) that appears in the cycle without iterating T times by using the fact that the cycle is generated by consecutive i.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over i from 0 to T-1, and for each i:\n\n            a_index = i % m\n            b_index = i % k\n\n            Then get the outcome for (A[a_index], B[b_index])\n\n        Then we can sum the outcomes for the full cycle.\n\n        Then, for the remainder, we iterate from i=0 to i=rem-1 and sum the outcomes for these remaining rounds.\n\n        However, T can be up to 1000000 (if m=1000, k=1000, then T=1000000) and then we have to do two passes of up to 1000000, which is acceptable in Python? Probably, because 1000000 is 1e6, and two passes of 1e6 is acceptable.\n\n        But note: n can be 2e9, and T = 1000000, then full_cycles = 2000, and we would do:\n\n            total_nike = 2000 * (cycle_sum_nike) + (remaining_sum_nike)\n\n        However, we don't need to store the entire cycle array, just the total for one cycle.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let g = gcd(m, k)\n            T = (m * k) // g\n\n            # Precompute the total for one cycle: \n            total_cycle_nike = 0\n            total_cycle_poly = 0\n\n            We can iterate i from 0 to T-1, but that is T steps (1e6) which is acceptable.\n\n            However, note: T might be 1000000, and we do two loops (one for the cycle and one for the remainder) but the remainder is at most T-1, so worst-case 2*T which is 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what if m and k are not coprime? Then T = LCM(m,k) = (m*k)//gcd(m,k). The iteration from 0 to T-1 is T steps.\n\n        Example: m=3, k=2, then T=6.\n\n        However, note: the pairs (i mod 3, i mod 2) for i=0 to 5:\n\n            i=0: (0,0)\n            i=1: (1,1)\n            i=2: (2,0)\n            i=3: (0,1)   -> because 3 mod 3=0, 3 mod 2=1\n            i=4: (1,0)\n            i=5: (2,1)\n\n        This is 6 distinct pairs.\n\n        How to compute gcd? Use Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say m,k between 1 and 1000, so T is at most 1000000.\n\n        Code structure:\n\n            import math\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A_str = input().strip()\n            B_str = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A_str)\n            k = len(B_str)\n\n            # Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n            g = math.gcd(m, k)\n            T = (m * k) // g\n\n            # If n <= T, we can simulate n rounds, but even for n > T we break into cycles.\n\n            # We'll create a helper function for outcome of a single round given two chars.\n\n            def outcome_round(a_char, b_char):\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    return (0, 0)\n                # Check if a_char beats b_char: \n                # Conditions: \n                #   Rock beats Scissors: ('R','S')\n                #   Scissors beats Paper: ('S','P')\n                #   Paper beats Rock: ('P','R')\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    return (0, 1)   # (nike_red, poly_red) -> since a_char (Nikephoros) wins, so Polycarpus (b_char) loses -> poly_red +=1\n                else:\n                    return (1, 0)   # B wins, so A (Nikephoros) loses -> nike_red +=1\n\n            # Precompute the full cycle: we'll simulate T rounds? Actually, we can also compute without iterating T if we can find a way to group by (a_index, b_index) but that is more complex.\n\n            # But note: the pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 are all distinct? Actually, they are T distinct pairs. So we can iterate i from 0 to T-1.\n\n            # However, we can also avoid iterating T by considering that the same (a_index, b_index) will appear exactly once per cycle. \n\n            # So we can do:\n\n            #   total_cycle_nike = 0\n            #   total_cycle_poly = 0\n            #   for i in range(T):\n            #       a_idx = i % m\n            #       b_idx = i % k\n            #       a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n            #       b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n            #       res = outcome_round(a_char, b_char)\n            #       total_cycle_nike += res[0]\n            #       total_cycle_poly += res[1]\n\n            # Then, we break n rounds:\n\n            cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            # Now, we need to compute the remaining part: the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n            # But note: the first 'rem' rounds are the rounds i=0 to i=rem-1.\n\n            # However, we can use the same iteration for the remainder.\n\n            # But wait: we already computed the entire cycle, so we can do:\n\n            #   total_nike = cycles * total_cycle_nike + (for i in range(rem): outcome_round(A_str[i%m], B_str[i%k])[0])\n            #   total_poly = cycles * total_cycle_poly + (for i in range(rem): outcome_round(A_str[i%m], B_str[i%k])[1])\n\n            # However, we don't want to recompute the entire cycle again for the remainder if we already did it for the full cycle.\n\n            # But note: the full cycle computation was for i from 0 to T-1, and the remainder is from 0 to rem-1, which is a subset.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can compute the remainder without storing the entire cycle.\n\n            # But we already stored the entire cycle's totals, so we just need to compute the remainder part.\n\n            # Let's compute the remainder part:\n\n            rem_nike = 0\n            rem_poly = 0\n            for i in range(rem):\n                a_idx = i % m\n                b_idx = i % k\n                a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n                b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n                res = outcome_round(a_char, b_char)\n                rem_nike += res[0]\n                rem_poly += res[1]\n\n            total_nike = cycles * total_cycle_nike + rem_nike\n            total_poly = cycles * total_cycle_poly + rem_poly\n\n            # Then output: print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\n        However, note: the full cycle was computed for i from 0 to T-1, but the remainder part is from 0 to rem-1, which is the same as the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n        But wait: the full cycle computation and the remainder computation are using the same formula: \n            a_idx = i % m, b_idx = i % k.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the sequences are cycled starting from the first element. So for round i, we use:\n            A_str[i % m] and B_str[i % k]\n\n        This matches.\n\n 6. However, what if T is 0? But m,k>=1, so T>=1.\n\n 7. Let's test with the example: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Here, m=3, k=4 -> T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem = 7.\n\n        We need to compute the outcome for the first 7 rounds.\n\n        Round 0: i=0 -> a0='R', b0='R' -> (0,0)\n        Round 1: i=1 -> a1='P', b1='S' -> (0,1) because 'P' beats 'S'? Actually, wait: \n            outcome_round('P','S'): \n                'P' vs 'S': \n                    'P' beats 'R', but not 'S'. Actually, the rule: \n                    Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n\n                So 'P' vs 'S': \n                    'P' is beaten by 'S'? No, because Scissors is beaten by Rock, and Paper is beaten by Scissors? \n                    Actually, the rule: \n                        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n                        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n                        Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n                So for (P, S): \n                    P vs S: \n                        P is not R, so not beating S by the first rule.\n                        S is not P, so the second rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so here we have P and S: \n                        This is the third rule? No, the third rule is Paper beats Rock. \n                    Actually, the rule for P and S: \n                        According to the list: \n                            (R,S) -> R wins\n                            (S,P) -> S wins\n                            (P,R) -> P wins\n\n                    So (P,S) is not in the list of wins for the first? It is not (R,S), (S,P), or (P,R). So it falls into the else: meaning B wins? \n\n                    But wait, the else condition is when (a,b) is not a win for a, then we assume b wins? \n\n                    But note: the condition for else is the opposite: the condition for a win for a is the three pairs. Otherwise, if a doesn't win, then either draw or b wins.\n\n                    However, we already checked for draw (a==b) so the else is when a loses? \n\n                    Let me check: \n                        (P, S): \n                            a='P', b='S'\n                            a != b -> so not draw.\n                            Then check: is (P, S) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]?\n                                (R,S): no\n                                (S,P): no\n                                (P,R): no -> so it's not a win for a.\n\n                    Then we return (1,0) meaning Nikephoros (a) loses, so that round is a loss for a (and a win for b). \n\n                    But wait: according to the rules, if a='P' and b='S', then who wins?\n                        The rule: \n                            Rock beats Scissors -> but we don't have Rock here.\n                            Scissors beats Paper -> yes, because we have S (Scissors) and P (Paper). So Scissors (b) beats Paper (a). \n\n                    So the outcome should be (1,0) because Nikephoros (a) loses.\n\n                    Therefore, the example says:\n\n                        Round 0: Draw.\n                        Round 1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses -> so (1,0) for this round.\n\n                    The example output: \n                        3 2\n\n                    According to the example: \n                        Round 0: Draw -> (0,0)\n                        Round 1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses -> (1,0) -> so far: Nikephoros=1, Polycarpus=0.\n                        Round 2: S vs P -> Polycarpus loses -> (0,1) -> now: (1,1)\n                        Round 3: R vs P -> Nikephoros loses -> (2,1)\n                        Round 4: P vs R -> Polycarpus loses -> (2,2)\n                        Round 5: S vs S -> (2,2) [draw]\n                        Round 6: R vs P -> Nikephoros loses -> (3,2)\n\n                    So the example says: \n                        3 for Nikephoros, 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n                    But wait, in round 2: \n                        i=2: a2 = A[2] = 'S', b2 = B[2] = 'P' -> outcome_round('S','P'): \n                            'S' vs 'P': \n                                Not equal.\n                                Check: ('S','P') is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, because ('S','P') is the second one.\n                                So return (0,1)\n\n                    Round 3: \n                        i=3: a3 = A[3 % 3] = A[0] = 'R', b3 = B[3 % 4] = B[3] = 'P' -> outcome_round('R','P'): \n                            'R' vs 'P': \n                                Not equal.\n                                Check: ('R','P') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no.\n                                Else: (1,0)\n\n                    Round 4:\n                        i=4: a4 = A[4 % 3] = A[1] = 'P', b4 = B[4 % 4] = B[0] = 'R' -> outcome_round('P','R'):\n                                ('P','R') is in the list -> (0,1)\n\n                    Round 5:\n                        i=5: a5 = A[5 % 3] = A[2] = 'S', b5 = B[5 % 4] = B[1] = 'S' -> draw -> (0,0)\n\n                    Round 6:\n                        i=6: a6 = A[6 % 3] = A[0] = 'R', b6 = B[6 % 4] = B[2] = 'P' -> (1,0)\n\n                    So total: \n                        Nikephoros: rounds 1,3,6 -> 3\n                        Polycarpus: rounds 2,4 -> 2\n\n                    So the code must return (3,2).\n\n        Now, how does our code compute the example?\n\n            n=7, m=3, k=4 -> T=12, cycles=0, rem=7.\n\n            We compute for i from 0 to 6:\n\n                i=0: (0,0) -> (0,0)\n                i=1: (1,0) -> (1,0)\n                i=2: (0,1) -> (0,1)\n                i=3: (1,0) -> (1,0)\n                i=4: (0,1) -> (0,1)\n                i=5: (0,0) -> (0,0)\n                i=6: (1,0) -> (1,0)\n\n            Sum for rem: \n                Nike: 1+1+1 = 3\n                Poly: 1+1 = 2\n\n            So that matches.\n\n        But wait, the example input was:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        The second sample: \n            Input: \n                5\n                RRRRRRRR\n                R\n\n            Output: \n                0 0\n\n            Why? \n\n            Let's break down:\n\n                n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n\n                m=8, k=1 -> T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n                cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\n                For i from 0 to 4:\n\n                    i=0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> (0,0)\n                    i=1: A[1]='R', B[1 mod 1=0] -> 'R','R' -> (0,0)\n                    ... all draws.\n\n                So total_nike=0, total_poly=0.\n\n            But wait, the example output is \"0 0\".\n\n        However, the example input in the problem note is:\n\n            Input:\n                ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n            Output:\n                ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n        So our code must output \"3 2\" for the first and \"0 0\" for the second.\n\n 8. Implementation:\n\n        We'll use math.gcd.\n\n        Note: We must be cautious for the performance: T can be up to 1000000, and we do two loops (one for the cycle and one for the remainder) but the remainder is at most T-1, so worst-case 2*T which is 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can avoid the second loop for the remainder by storing the outcomes for each i in the cycle? But we already computed the cycle for i from 0 to T-1. But note: we didn't store the outcomes per i, we only stored the total for the entire cycle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute an array for the entire cycle and then use prefix sums for the cycle to avoid the remainder loop.\n\n        Steps for optimization (if needed):\n\n            We can precompute an array `outcomes_cycle` of length T, where:\n\n                outcomes_cycle[i] = outcome_round(A[i%m], B[i%k])   # but wait, i in [0, T-1] and we use i%m and i%k.\n\n            Then we can compute:\n\n                total_cycle_nike = sum(outcomes_cycle[i][0] for i in range(T))\n\n            Similarly, we can precompute a prefix sum for the cycle for the remainder:\n\n                prefix_nike[i] = outcomes_cycle[0][0] + outcomes_cycle[1][0] + ... + outcomes_cycle[i][0]\n\n            Then for the remainder part, we can do:\n\n                rem_nike = prefix_nike[rem-1]   # if rem>0, else 0\n\n            But note: the remainder part is the first 'rem' rounds, which correspond to i from 0 to rem-1.\n\n            However, we already have the entire cycle's outcomes stored, but we don't want to store an array of 1e6 integers if we don't have to. \n\n            But 1e6 integers is about 4MB, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we are only doing two loops of T (each 1e6) and then one loop of rem (at most 1e6) so worst-case 3e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But let me see: the problem says n can be up to 2e9, but T is at most 1000000, so we are safe.\n\n        But wait: the first loop (for the full cycle) is T steps, the second loop (for the remainder) is at most T steps, so worst-case 2*T which is 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can combine the two loops: we don't need to compute the entire cycle separately if we are going to use the same method for the remainder.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the entire cycle and the remainder in one go, but the remainder is a subset of the cycle.\n\n        Since we are already computing the cycle, and the remainder is the beginning, we can compute:\n\n            total_cycle_nike = 0\n            total_cycle_poly = 0\n\n            # We'll also store the outcomes for each i in the cycle? Maybe not, but we can compute the remainder from the same formula.\n\n        Let's stick to the simple method.\n\n 9.

Edge: n=0? The problem states n>=1.\n\n 11. Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\" -> outputs \"3 2\"\n\n        Example 2:\n            n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\" -> outputs \"0 0\"\n\n 12.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the outcome for a large number of rounds without simulating each round individually, which would be computationally infeasible for very large `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a cyclic sequence of moves (Rock, Scissors, Paper). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count the number of times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot) over `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences of moves for both players repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of `T` rounds and then multiplying the results by the number of full cycles, followed by processing the remaining rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute `T` as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - **Outcome Calculation**: For each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), determine the outcome (who loses) based on the current moves from both sequences.\n   - **Aggregation**: Sum the losses for each player over one full cycle. Then, for the remaining rounds (if any), compute the losses similarly and combine the results from all full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes `T` rounds once to compute the cycle's outcome, where `T` is at most `m * k` (since `T = LCM(m, k)`). Given that `m` and `k` are up to 1000, `T` can be up to 1,000,000. The remaining rounds are processed in linear time, making the overall complexity manageable even for large `n` (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n\n    def outcome_round(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n\n    total_cycle_nike = 0\n    total_cycle_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n        b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n        res = outcome_round(a_char, b_char)\n        total_cycle_nike += res[0]\n        total_cycle_poly += res[1]\n\n    rem_nike = 0\n    rem_poly = 0\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[a_idx]\n        b_char = B_str[b_idx]\n        res = outcome_round(a_char, b_char)\n        rem_nike += res[0]\n        rem_poly += res[1]\n\n    total_nike = cycles * total_cycle_nike + rem_nike\n    total_poly = cycles * total_cycle_poly + rem_poly\n\n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Outcome Function**: The helper function `outcome_round` checks the result of a single round between two moves, returning a tuple indicating how many red spots each player gets.\n4. **Cycle Processing**: The code processes each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), summing the red spots for both players.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: The remaining rounds (if any) after processing full cycles are handled separately.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The total red spots for each player are computed by multiplying the cycle results by the number of full cycles and adding the results from the remaining rounds.\n7. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, avoiding the need for individual round simulation.",
