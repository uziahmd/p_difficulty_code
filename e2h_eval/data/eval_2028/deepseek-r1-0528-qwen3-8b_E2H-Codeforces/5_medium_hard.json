Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters). We have to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot) such that the colors are compatible.\n\n Compatibility rules:\n   - Two specific colors: must be the same.\n   - Indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n 2. The problem can be broken down into two parts:\n    a) Matching the boots that have fixed colors (non '?') with compatible ones (same letter or with a '?' on either side).\n    b) Also, we have to consider the '?' which can match anything.\n\n However, note: We are allowed to use a '?' as either a left or right boot arbitrarily. But note that if we use a '?' in one side, it can only match a fixed color or another '?'.\n\n But wait: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any. So:\n   - If we have a left boot with color 'x' (fixed) and a right boot with color '?', they are compatible.\n   - Similarly, a left boot with '?' and a right boot with fixed color 'x' is compatible.\n   - A left boot with '?' and a right boot with '?' is also compatible.\n\n However, we want the maximum number of pairs.\n\n Observation: We have two types of boots: fixed and wildcard ('?'). We can use wildcards to fill in for mismatches.\n\n But note: we have exactly n left boots and n right boots.\n\n Let's denote:\n   L = list of left boots (with their color and index)\n   R = list of right boots (with their color and index)\n\n We are to output the maximum k and then k lines, each containing two indices (left index and right index).\n\n Important: We are to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Count the total number of '?' in left and right.\n\n However, note: we can form a pair between two '?'? Yes, that is allowed.\n\n But how to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n We can think greedily:\n\n   - First, we can try to match as many fixed color pairs as possible (without using a '?' from either side).\n\n   - Then, we can use the remaining '?' to form pairs. But note: sometimes we might use a '?' from one side to match a fixed color on the other side? Actually, the rule allows that.\n\n However, the problem does not require to separate the matching by type. We just need maximum pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We note that the total pairs we can form is at most n.\n\n   We can break the problem into two sets:\n\n     Set A: Boots without '?' (fixed)\n     Set B: Boots with '?' \n\n   But note: we can form a pair between two fixed boots if they are the same, and also a fixed boot can be paired with a '?' from the opposite side.\n\n   However, we want maximum pairs.\n\n   We can do:\n\n     Step 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots. How?\n        We can count the frequency of each fixed color in left and right.\n\n        But note: the same color in left and right can be matched. However, we have two separate arrays.\n\n        Actually, we have two strings: l and r.\n\n        Let's create:\n\n          left_fixed = [c for c in l if c != '?']   # but we need to remember the index too\n          right_fixed = [c for c in r if c != '?']\n\n        Then, for each color, we can match up to min(count_left[color], count_right[color]) fixed pairs.\n\n        However, wait: the problem is that we have two independent lists. We can't just take the counts because the same color may appear multiple times, but we have to assign without conflict.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to assign any fixed color to any fixed color of the same letter, regardless of position. So we can use a bipartite matching for fixed colors? However, n can be up to 150000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a frequency array for fixed colors and then subtract the matches.\n\n        However, there is a catch: we have two separate lists (left and right). We can do:\n\n          Create a dictionary for left_fixed: {color: count}\n          Create a dictionary for right_fixed: {color: count}\n\n        Then, the maximum fixed-fixed pairs is the sum over all colors of min(left_count[color], right_count[color]). But wait: is that correct?\n\n        Example: \n          left: \"a\", \"a\", \"b\"\n          right: \"a\", \"b\", \"b\"\n\n        Then, \n          left: {'a':2, 'b':1}\n          right: {'a':1, 'b':2}\n          min for 'a' is 1, for 'b' is 1 -> total 2.\n\n        But we can form two pairs: (a,a), (b,b) but wait, we have three boots on each side? Actually, we have three left and three right. We can form two pairs, and one boot remains.\n\n        However, the example above: we can form two pairs: one (a from left with a from right) and one (b from left with b from right). This matches the min sum.\n\n        But what about the same color appearing in both left and right? It doesn't matter which one we use.\n\n        So, we can compute:\n\n          fixed_matches = 0\n          freq_left = {}\n          for char in l:\n            if char != '?':\n                freq_left[char] = freq_left.get(char,0)+1\n\n          Similarly for right.\n\n          Then, for each color in freq_left:\n            fixed_matches += min(freq_left[color], freq_right.get(color,0))\n\n        However, wait: what if a color appears only in left? Then we don't use it in fixed matching. Similarly for right.\n\n        But note: we are only matching fixed to fixed. So this is correct.\n\n        Step 2: After matching fixed boots, we remove those boots from consideration.\n\n        Now, we are left with:\n\n          left_remaining: the left boots that were originally '?' or were not matched (from fixed) and similarly for right.\n\n        But note: the fixed boots that are matched are removed. The rest are the unmatched fixed boots and the wildcards.\n\n        However, we can also consider: maybe we should use the wildcards to match the unmatched fixed boots? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: we want maximum pairs. We can use wildcards to match fixed boots. So the total pairs might be:\n\n          base = fixed_matches (from step 1) + (matching unmatched fixed boots with wildcards) + (matching wildcards together)\n\n        But wait, we can also use a wildcard to match a fixed boot, and then use the other wildcard to match something else.\n\n        How to count the total maximum?\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n          We have two sets: \n            Left: some fixed colors and some wildcards (the '?' in left)\n            Right: some fixed colors and some wildcards (the '?' in right)\n\n          The total pairs we can form is at most n.\n\n          We can form a pair if:\n            (left_color == right_color) OR (left_color == '?' OR right_color == '?')\n\n          But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n          However, the constraint is that we cannot use a boot twice.\n\n        We can model this as a bipartite graph:\n\n          Left nodes: indices 0 to n-1 (representing left boots)\n          Right nodes: indices 0 to n-1 (representing right boots)\n\n          Edge exists between left i and right j if:\n            (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') is not the condition? Actually, the condition is:\n\n            Condition: \n              if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?': then compatible.\n              else: l[i] == r[j]\n\n          But note: the condition is symmetric and includes the case where both are '?'.\n\n        However, building a graph of 150000 nodes and potentially O(n^2) edges is too expensive.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n          Part 1: Matching fixed boots (non '?') with fixed boots and with wildcards.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require to separate the matching by type. We just need the maximum.\n\n        However, note that the problem asks for the maximum number and the pairs.\n\n        We can use a greedy matching:\n\n          Step 1: Count the total fixed boots and wildcards.\n\n          Let:\n            left_fixed = list of non '?' in l (with index)\n            left_wild = list of indices where l[i]=='?'\n            right_fixed = list of non '?' in r (with index)\n            right_wild = list of indices where r[i]=='?'\n\n          Step 2: We can first match fixed boots with fixed boots. But note: we can also use wildcards to match fixed boots, but if we use a wildcard for a fixed boot, then we are using a resource that could be used for two fixed boots (if we use two wildcards). \n\n          Actually, we want maximum pairs. We can use:\n\n            total_pairs = min(n, (number of fixed matches) + (min(len(left_wild), len(right_wild))) + ... ) ?\n\n          But wait: the fixed matches are already computed (by color). However, after matching fixed boots, we are left with:\n\n            Let F = fixed_matches (from step 1) from the fixed boots.\n\n            Then, we have:\n              left_remaining = n - (number of fixed boots in left) - (number of wildcards in left) ??? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            total_left = n\n            fixed_left = len(left_fixed)   [but note: we matched some of them in step 1]\n            wild_left = len(left_wild)\n\n            Similarly, fixed_right = len(right_fixed), wild_right = len(right_wild)\n\n          But wait, we cannot simply use the initial counts because we might have matched some fixed boots.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a two-step matching:\n\n          Step 1: Match fixed boots (non '?') with fixed boots (non '?') by color. We do:\n\n            For each color, let x = min(count_left[color], count_right[color])\n            Then we can form x pairs for that color.\n\n          Step 2: Then, we have remaining fixed boots (which are the ones that are not matched). These remaining fixed boots can be matched with wildcards. And then the wildcards that are left can be matched together.\n\n          However, note: the wildcards can be used to match any, so we can use a wildcard from left to match a fixed boot (or a wildcard) from right, and vice versa.\n\n          The remaining fixed boots (say, L_rem in left and R_rem in right) can be matched with the wildcards.\n\n          Let:\n\n            fixed_left_initial = [c for c in l if c != '?']\n            fixed_right_initial = [c for c in r if c != '?']\n\n            We matched F = sum_{color} min(count_left[color], count_right[color])\n\n            Then, the unmatched fixed boots are:\n\n              left_fixed_unmatched = fixed_left_initial but we don't know which ones? Actually, we can't track by index if we only use counts.\n\n          But note: we are required to output the pairs. So we need to know which indices to use.\n\n        Therefore, we need to:\n\n          1. Compute the maximum fixed matches per color (by frequency) and then record which indices are matched.\n\n          2. Then, we can use wildcards to match the remaining fixed boots and the remaining wildcards.\n\n        However, the problem is that the fixed boots that are not matched in step 1 can be matched with wildcards, and also the wildcards can be matched with each other.\n\n        The total pairs we can form is:\n\n          base = F (from step 1)\n\n          Then, we have:\n\n            remaining_fixed_left = total_fixed_left - (number of fixed_left used in step1)\n            remaining_fixed_right = total_fixed_right - (number of fixed_right used in step1)\n\n          But note: in step1 we used exactly F pairs, so the unmatched fixed boots are:\n\n            unmatched_fixed_left = total_fixed_left - (for each color, the number of fixed_left[color] used is min(count_left[color], count_right[color]), so the unmatched_fixed_left for a color is count_left[color] - min(count_left[color], count_right[color]) = max(0, count_left[color] - count_right[color])\n\n            Similarly, unmatched_fixed_right = max(0, count_right[color] - count_left[color])\n\n          However, wait: no. Actually, for a given color, we use min(count_left[color], count_right[color]). Then, the unmatched fixed boots of that color are:\n\n            left: count_left[color] - min(count_left[color], count_right[color]) = max(0, count_left[color] - count_right[color])\n            right: count_right[color] - min(count_left[color], count_right[color]) = max(0, count_right[color] - count_left[color])\n\n          Then, we have:\n\n            total_remaining_fixed_left = sum_{color} max(0, count_left[color] - count_right[color])\n            total_remaining_fixed_right = sum_{color} max(0, count_right[color] - count_left[color])\n\n          But wait, that is the leftover from fixed boots. Then, we have wildcards:\n\n            left_wild = len([i for i in range(n) if l[i]=='?'])\n            right_wild = len([i for i in range(n) if r[i]=='?'])\n\n          Now, we can use the wildcards to match the remaining fixed boots. But note: the remaining fixed boots are of different colors. However, a wildcard can match any fixed boot. Similarly, we can use wildcards to match the remaining fixed boots from the opposite side.\n\n          However, we can also use a wildcard from left to match a wildcard from right. And that would free up a fixed boot to be matched by a wildcard from the opposite side.\n\n          Actually, we can think:\n\n            We have two kinds of remaining boots:\n\n              Type 1: Left boots that are fixed and unmatched (call these L_fixed_unmatched) and right boots that are fixed and unmatched (R_fixed_unmatched).\n\n              Type 2: Wildcard boots (L_wild and R_wild).\n\n            Now, we can use wildcards to match the unmatched fixed boots. Each wildcard from left can match any fixed boot (or even a wildcard) from right, and vice versa.\n\n            The goal is to maximize the total pairs.\n\n            We can form:\n\n              pairs from L_fixed_unmatched and R_wild: but note, we can use a right wildcard to match a left fixed unmatched, but then we use one wildcard from right.\n\n              Similarly, we can form pairs from R_fixed_unmatched and L_wild.\n\n            However, we can also form pairs between wildcards.\n\n            The total pairs from wildcards and unmatched fixed boots is limited by:\n\n              Let X = min(L_fixed_unmatched, R_wild)   [using wildcards from right to match left unmatched fixed]\n              Let Y = min(R_fixed_unmatched, L_wild)   [using wildcards from left to match right unmatched fixed]\n\n            Then, we can use the remaining wildcards to match each other:\n\n              Z = min(L_wild - Y, R_wild - X)\n\n            Then, the total pairs would be:\n\n              base (F) + X + Y + Z\n\n            Is that the maximum?\n\n            Example: \n              n=2, l=\"a?\" and r=\"?b\"\n\n              Step1: fixed matches: \n                l_fixed = ['a'], r_fixed = ['b'] -> no fixed match (F=0)\n\n              Then, unmatched fixed: left has 'a' (unmatched) and right has 'b' (unmatched). \n              L_fixed_unmatched = 1, R_fixed_unmatched = 1.\n\n              Wildcards: left has 1, right has 1.\n\n              Then, we can do:\n\n                X = min(1, 1) = 1   [use the right wildcard to match the left fixed 'a']\n                Y = min(1, 1) = 1   [use the left wildcard to match the right fixed 'b']\n                Then Z = min(0,0)=0.\n\n              Total pairs = 0+1+1+0 = 2.\n\n              But wait, the two pairs are:\n                (left0: 'a' with right1: '?') -> but wait, the right boot at index1 is '?' and the left boot at index0 is 'a'. \n                (left1: '?' with right0: 'b') -> left boot at index1 is '?' and right boot at index0 is 'b'.\n\n              This gives two pairs.\n\n            But is there a better way? Actually, we could also do:\n\n                (left0: 'a' with right0: 'b') -> not compatible (because 'a' != 'b')\n                (left1: '?' with right1: '?') -> compatible.\n\n              That gives one pair.\n\n            So the above method gives 2 pairs, which is better.\n\n            However, wait: the example input was:\n\n                l = \"a?\" (n=2, so two left boots: index0='a', index1='?')\n                r = \"?b\" (index0='?', index1='b')\n\n            Then, the two pairs we formed are:\n\n                Pair1: left0 with right1 -> 'a' and 'b'? -> not compatible! \n\n            Wait, I made a mistake. \n\n            Condition: \n                For (left0, right1): 'a' and 'b' -> not compatible (unless one is '?'). Here, left0 is 'a' (fixed) and right1 is 'b' (fixed) -> so they are not the same -> not compatible.\n\n            Then how did we get 2 pairs?\n\n            Actually, the above calculation assumed:\n\n                We used the right wildcard (at index0) to match the left fixed 'a' (at index0): \n                    Condition: left0='a' and right0='?' -> compatible.\n\n                Then, we used the left wildcard (at index1) to match the right fixed 'b' (at index1):\n                    Condition: left1='?' and right1='b' -> compatible.\n\n            So the two pairs are (0,0) and (1,1). \n\n            But wait: the example input was:\n\n                l = \"a?\" -> left boots: index0='a', index1='?'\n                r = \"?b\" -> right boots: index0='?', index1='b'\n\n            Then the two pairs are:\n\n                (0,0): left0 and right0 -> 'a' and '?' -> compatible.\n                (1,1): left1 and right1 -> '?' and 'b' -> compatible.\n\n            So that is valid.\n\n            However, note: the problem requires to output the indices (the problem uses 1-indexed indices). In our example, the left boot indices are 0 and 1 (so in 1-indexed: 1 and 2) and the right boot indices are 0 and 1 (so 1 and 2). Then the output would be:\n\n                2\n                1 1\n                2 2\n\n            But wait, the example above: \n                Input: \n                  2\n                  a?\n                  ?b\n\n            Output:\n                2\n                1 1\n                2 2\n\n            However, the problem states: the j-th line should contain the index of the left boot and the index of the right boot. The left boots are given in order from 1 to n, and the right boots from 1 to n.\n\n            But note: the example input:\n\n                Input: \n                  2\n                  ab\n                  ba\n\n            Then, we have two left boots: 'a','b' and two right boots: 'b','a'\n\n            Then, we can form two pairs: \n                (left0='a' with right0='b') -> not compatible? \n                (left1='b' with right1='a') -> not compatible.\n\n            So the maximum pairs is 0.\n\n            But wait, our method for fixed matches:\n\n                F = for color 'a': min(1,1)=1; for color 'b': min(1,1)=1 -> total F=2.\n\n            Why? Because we have two fixed boots. We can match:\n\n                left0='a' with right1='a'? -> but wait, the right string is \"ba\": so right0='b', right1='a'.\n\n            Then, we can match left0='a' with right1='a' -> that's one pair, and left1='b' with right0='b' -> that's one pair.\n\n            But wait, the example input was \"ab\" and \"ba\". Then:\n\n                left0='a' and right1='a' -> compatible (same)\n                left1='b' and right0='b' -> compatible (same)\n\n            So the pairs are (0,1) and (1,0). \n\n            However, the problem does not require the pairs to be in any particular order (as long as we use distinct indices). \n\n            But note: the example output format: \n                Print k â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots.\n                Then k lines: a_j and b_j (the indices of the left and right boots).\n\n            We must output the left boot index (from 1 to n) and the right boot index (from 1 to n). \n\n            So for the above example, we would output:\n\n                2\n                1 2   [meaning left boot 1 (index0) and right boot 2 (index1)]\n                2 1   [meaning left boot 2 (index1) and right boot 1 (index0)]\n\n            But wait, the problem does not specify the order of the pairs. However, we must use each boot only once.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n          Step 1: We will build two dictionaries for the fixed boots (non '?') and record the index.\n\n          Step 2: We will also record the positions of the wildcards.\n\n          Step 3: We want to match as many fixed boots as possible (by color) without using wildcards.\n\n          Step 4: Then, we want to match the remaining fixed boots (that couldn't be matched because there's no opposite fixed boot) with the wildcards.\n\n          Step 5: Then, we match the leftover wildcards with each other.\n\n        However, the challenge is to output the actual pairs (the indices). \n\n        We need to:\n\n          - For the fixed matches (step3): we need to assign specific indices. We can do:\n\n            For each color, we have a list of left indices (from the original string) and a list of right indices (from the original string) for that color.\n\n            Then, we can arbitrarily assign the smallest left index to the smallest right index? But note: we are going to use each index only once.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n              For each color, we have two lists: left_list and right_list (each sorted). Then we can form min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs by matching the i-th smallest left index with the i-th smallest right index.\n\n          Step 4: Then, for the remaining fixed boots (the ones that were left in the left_list and right_list for that color) we can match them arbitrarily with the wildcards. But note: we have two separate sets: the unmatched fixed boots and the wildcards.\n\n          However, we have two sides: left and right. \n\n          Specifically, we have:\n\n            After step3, we have:\n\n              left_fixed_remaining: a list of indices (from the left) that have fixed color but were not matched (because there were more left than right for that color)\n              right_fixed_remaining: a list of indices (from the right) that have fixed color but were not matched (because there were more right than left for that color)\n\n            And we have:\n\n              left_wild_remaining: the entire set of left wildcards (since we haven't used any yet) minus the ones we use in step4 and step5.\n              right_wild_remaining: similarly.\n\n          But note: in step4, we can use a wildcard from left to match a fixed boot from the right (which is unmatched) and vice versa.\n\n          However, we have to be careful: we cannot use a wildcard more than once.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let U = []  # list of pairs we are going to form.\n\n            Step 1: Fixed-Fixed matching.\n\n            For each color, we have:\n                lefts = sorted list of indices for that color in l (excluding wildcards)\n                rights = sorted list of indices for that color in r (excluding wildcards)\n\n            Then, we form min(len(lefts), len(rights)) pairs by taking the first min(len(lefts), len(rights)) from lefts and rights.\n\n            Then, we remove these from the lefts and rights for that color.\n\n            Then, the remaining lefts (for that color) are the unmatched fixed boots on the left, and similarly for the right.\n\n            Then, we collect:\n\n                left_fixed_remaining = all the unmatched fixed boots (across all colors) from left.\n                right_fixed_remaining = all the unmatched fixed boots (across all colors) from right.\n\n            Step 2: Now, we can use the wildcards to match the unmatched fixed boots.\n\n            However, note: we have two kinds of unmatched fixed boots: left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining.\n\n            We can use:\n\n                For left_fixed_remaining: we can match each one with a right_wildcard (if available) OR with a right_fixed_remaining (if we are allowed to use a fixed boot from the opposite side? But wait, we are trying to avoid using two wildcards to fix two fixed boots? Actually, no: we are trying to maximize the total pairs.\n\n            But wait, the condition: we can match two fixed boots if they are the same. But we already did that. Now, we cannot match two unmatched fixed boots from the same side because they are fixed and unless they are the same, they are not compatible. However, note: the unmatched fixed boots might be of different colors. So we cannot match two unmatched fixed boots arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, the unmatched fixed boots are the ones that were in excess for their own color. They are fixed and of specific colors, and they are not the same as the opposite side's fixed boots (because we matched by color). But they might be the same as other colors? \n\n            However, we are considering the entire set of fixed boots. The unmatched ones are the ones that were not matched because the opposite side didn't have enough. They are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n            Now, we can use wildcards to match these unmatched fixed boots. \n\n            The idea:\n\n              We can use a left wildcard to match a right_fixed_remaining (which is a fixed boot on the right) and a right wildcard to match a left_fixed_remaining.\n\n            But note: we have two kinds of wildcards: left and right.\n\n            We can form:\n\n                Type 1: (left_fixed_remaining, right_wild) -> use one right_wild for one left_fixed_remaining.\n                Type 2: (right_fixed_remaining, left_wild) -> use one left_wild for one right_fixed_remaining.\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards (after using as many as we can for the unmatched fixed boots) can be matched together.\n\n            However, we can also use a wildcard from left to match a wildcard from right (Type 3).\n\n            But note: we want the maximum pairs. The total pairs we can form is:\n\n                base (from step1) + \n                (number of left_fixed_remaining we can match with right_wild) + \n                (number of right_fixed_remaining we can match with left_wild) + \n                (number of wildcards left after that, matched together)\n\n            But note: the number of left_fixed_remaining we can match is min(len(left_fixed_remaining), len(right_wild))\n            Similarly, the number of right_fixed_remaining we can match is min(len(right_fixed_remaining), len(left_wild))\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards are:\n\n                left_wild_remaining = len(left_wild) - min(len(right_fixed_remaining), len(left_wild))\n                right_wild_remaining = len(right_wild) - min(len(left_fixed_remaining), len(right_wild))\n\n            Then, we can form min(left_wild_remaining, right_wild_remaining) pairs from wildcards.\n\n            However, wait: we cannot use the same wildcard twice. But note: we are using the wildcards in two steps: first for unmatched fixed boots, then for matching with each other.\n\n            The total pairs from wildcards is:\n\n                step4: min(len(left_fixed_remaining), len(right_wild)) [for matching left_fixed_remaining with right_wild]\n                step5: min(len(right_fixed_remaining), len(left_wild) - step4_used)   [but wait, we used some left_wild in step4? No, step4 uses right_wild and step5 uses left_wild]\n\n            Actually, step4 and step5 are independent because they use different sets of wildcards.\n\n            However, note: the total left_wild is fixed, and we use some in step5 (matching with right_fixed_remaining). Similarly, the total right_wild is fixed, and we use some in step4.\n\n            Then, the leftover wildcards (after step4 and step5) are:\n\n                left_wild_remaining = total_left_wild - min(len(right_fixed_remaining), total_left_wild)   [But wait, step4 doesn't use left_wild, step5 uses left_wild to match right_fixed_remaining]\n\n                Actually, step4 uses right_wild (so we use min(len(left_fixed_remaining), total_right_wild) of the right_wild).\n                Then, step5 uses min(len(right_fixed_remaining), total_left_wild) of the left_wild.\n\n                Then, the leftover left_wild = total_left_wild - min(len(right_fixed_remaining), total_left_wild)\n                leftover right_wild = total_right_wild - min(len(left_fixed_remaining), total_right_wild)\n\n                Then, we can form min(leftover_left_wild, leftover_right_wild) pairs from wildcards.\n\n            But wait, is that correct? \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, l=\"a?\" and r=\"?b\"\n\n                Step1: fixed matches: none (because 'a' and 'b' are different, and we don't have the same color in both fixed). So base=0.\n\n                Then, left_fixed_remaining = [0] (because the left has a fixed 'a' at index0 and it wasn't matched because there was no 'a' in the right fixed? Actually, the right fixed is 'b'. So we don't have 'a' in the right fixed. So left_fixed_remaining = [0] and right_fixed_remaining = [1] (because the right has a fixed 'b' at index1 and there was no left fixed 'b').\n\n                Then, step4: use right_wild to match left_fixed_remaining: \n                    We have one right_wild (at index0) and one left_fixed_remaining (at index0). So we can form 1 pair: (0,0) -> meaning left0 and right0.\n\n                Then, step5: use left_wild to match right_fixed_remaining: \n                    We have one left_wild (at index1) and one right_fixed_remaining (at index1). So we can form 1 pair: (1,1) -> meaning left1 and right1.\n\n                Then, step6: leftover wildcards: \n                    left_wild_remaining = 1 (initial) - 1 (used in step5) = 0\n                    right_wild_remaining = 1 (initial) - 1 (used in step4) = 0\n                    so 0.\n\n                Total pairs = 0 (base) + 1 (step4) + 1 (step5) + 0 = 2.\n\n            Another example: \n                n=3, l=\"a??\", r=\"?b?\"\n\n                Step1: fixed matches: \n                    color 'a': left has [0], right has [] (because the right fixed is only 'b') -> 0\n                    color 'b': left has [] (no fixed 'b'), right has [1] -> 0\n                    base=0.\n\n                Then, left_fixed_remaining = [0] (the 'a' at index0)\n                right_fixed_remaining = [1] (the 'b' at index1)\n\n                left_wild = [1,2] (indices1 and 2)\n                right_wild = [0,2] (indices0 and 2)\n\n                Step4: use right_wild to match left_fixed_remaining: \n                    min(1, 2) = 1 -> use one right_wild (any one, say the smallest index: 0) to match the left_fixed_remaining (index0). Then we form (0,0).\n\n                Step5: use left_wild to match right_fixed_remaining:\n                    min(1, 2) = 1 -> use one left_wild (any one, say the smallest index: 1) to match the right_fixed_remaining (index1). Then we form (1,1).\n\n                Then, leftover wildcards: \n                    left_wild_remaining = 2 - 1 = 1 (index2)\n                    right_wild_remaining = 2 - 1 = 1 (index2)\n\n                Then, we can form one more pair from wildcards: (2,2) -> meaning left2 and right2.\n\n                Total pairs = 0+1+1+1 = 3.\n\n            But wait, the example: \n                l=\"a??\", r=\"?b?\"\n                The pairs are:\n                  (0,0): left0='a' and right0='?' -> compatible.\n                  (1,1): left1='?' and right1='b' -> compatible.\n                  (2,2): left2='?' and right2='?' -> compatible.\n\n            So indeed 3 pairs.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          Steps:\n\n          1. Parse input.\n\n          2. Separate the indices for left and right:\n\n            left_fixed = {}  # mapping: color -> list of indices (in increasing order)\n            left_wild = []   # list of indices\n            right_fixed = {} # mapping: color -> list of indices\n            right_wild = []\n\n            Also, we'll keep the entire list of left and right indices.\n\n          3. For i in range(n):\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                if l[i] not in left_fixed:\n                    left_fixed[l[i]] = []\n                left_fixed[l[i]].append(i)\n            else:\n                left_wild.append(i)\n\n            Similarly for r.\n\n          4. For each color in left_fixed, sort the list (they are collected in increasing index order, but we'll sort anyway) and similarly for right_fixed.\n\n          5. Now, do fixed-fixed matching:\n\n            base_pairs = 0\n            pairs = []   # we will store the pairs (left_index, right_index) for base matching\n\n            # But we need to know which indices are used in base matching.\n\n            # For each color, if it exists in both left_fixed and right_fixed, then we take the minimum of the two lists.\n\n            # However, we also have to consider colors that are only in one side.\n\n            # We can iterate over the union of keys.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # For each color in left_fixed:\n            #   if color in right_fixed:\n            #       m = min(len(left_fixed[color]), len(right_fixed[color]))\n            #       Then, take the first m from left_fixed[color] and the first m from right_fixed[color] and form pairs.\n\n            # But note: the same index in left_fixed[color] and right_fixed[color] are being used.\n\n            # We'll do:\n\n            #   For each color, we sort the lists (they are already in increasing index order, but we'll sort to be safe).\n\n            #   Then, for each color, we match the smallest m left indices with the smallest m right indices.\n\n            # However, we must avoid using the same index twice.\n\n            # Since we are storing the indices separately, we can do:\n\n            for color in set(left_fixed.keys()) | set(right_fixed.keys()):\n                left_list = left_fixed.get(color, [])\n                right_list = right_fixed.get(color, [])\n                left_list.sort()\n                right_list.sort()\n                m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                base_pairs += m\n                # Now, we remove these m pairs from the fixed sets for this color.\n\n                # But we need to record which indices we used.\n\n                for i in range(m):\n                    # We use the i-th element of left_list and right_list\n                    idx_left = left_list[i]\n                    idx_right = right_list[i]\n                    # Record the pair (idx_left, idx_right) for base matching.\n                    pairs.append((idx_left, idx_right))\n\n                # Remove the first m from left_list and right_list for this color?\n                # But note: we are going to use the remaining for step4 and step5.\n\n                # We don't actually remove from the stored lists because we are going to use the entire left_fixed and right_fixed for step4 (the unmatched ones).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by matching specific colors or using wildcards ('?') which can match any color. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching two sets of boots (left and right) based on their colors. A left boot and a right boot are compatible if their colors are the same or if either is a wildcard. The goal is to form the maximum number of such pairs without reusing any boot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Step 1: Match fixed boots** (those with specific colors). For each color, match as many left boots as there are matching right boots of the same color.\n   - **Step 2: Match unmatched fixed boots with wildcards**. Use wildcards from the opposite side to match any remaining fixed boots that couldn't be matched in Step 1.\n   - **Step 3: Match leftover wildcards**. Any remaining wildcards can be paired together since wildcards are compatible with any color.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Matching**: For each color, count the occurrences in both left and right boots and match them pairwise.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: After matching fixed boots, use wildcards to match the remaining fixed boots, then match any leftover wildcards.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once to categorize them into fixed or wildcard lists and then performs matching operations which are linear in the number of boots. The overall complexity is O(n), where n is the number of boots, making it efficient for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = {}\n    left_wild = []\n    right_fixed = {}\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_wild.append(i)\n        else:\n            if char not in left_fixed:\n                left_fixed[char] = []\n            left_fixed[char].append(i)\n            \n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_wild.append(i)\n        else:\n            if char not in right_fixed:\n                right_fixed[char] = []\n            right_fixed[char].append(i)\n            \n    base_pairs = 0\n    pairs = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    all_colors = set(left_fixed.keys()) | set(right_fixed.keys())\n    \n    for color in all_colors:\n        left_list = left_fixed.get(color, [])\n        right_list = right_fixed.get(color, [])\n        left_list.sort()\n        right_list.sort()\n        m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        base_pairs += m\n        for j in range(m):\n            idx_left = left_list[j]\n            idx_right = right_list[j]\n            pairs.append((idx_left, idx_right))\n            used_left.add(idx_left)\n            used_right.add(idx_right)\n            \n    left_fixed_remaining = []\n    for color, indices in left_fixed.items():\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx not in used_left:\n                left_fixed_remaining.append(idx)\n                \n    right_fixed_remaining = []\n    for color, indices in right_fixed.items():\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx not in used_right:\n                right_fixed_remaining.append(idx)\n                \n    left_fixed_remaining.sort()\n    right_fixed_remaining.sort()\n    \n    step4_pairs = []\n    used_wild_right = set()\n    used_wild_left = set()\n    \n    for idx_left in left_fixed_remaining:\n        if used_wild_right:\n            found = False\n            for idx_right in right_wild:\n                if idx_right not in used_wild_right:\n                    step4_pairs.append((idx_left, idx_right))\n                    used_wild_right.add(idx_right)\n                    used_wild_left.add(idx_left)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                continue\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    step5_pairs = []\n    for idx_right in right_fixed_remaining:\n        if used_wild_left:\n            found = False\n            for idx_left in left_wild:\n                if idx_left not in used_wild_left:\n                    step5_pairs.append((idx_left, idx_right))\n                    used_wild_left.add(idx_left)\n                    used_wild_right.add(idx_right)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                continue\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    step6_pairs = []\n    left_wild_remaining = [idx for idx in left_wild if idx not in used_wild_left]\n    right_wild_remaining = [idx for idx in right_wild if idx not in used_wild_right]\n    left_wild_remaining.sort()\n    right_wild_remaining.sort()\n    \n    m = min(len(left_wild_remaining), len(right_wild_remaining))\n    for i in range(m):\n        step6_pairs.append((left_wild_remaining[i], right_wild_remaining[i]))\n        \n    total_pairs = base_pairs + len(step4_pairs) + len(step5_pairs) + len(step6_pairs)\n    \n    print(total_pairs)\n    \n    all_pairs = pairs + [(a, b) for a, b in step4_pairs] + [(a, b) for a, b in step5_pairs] + [(a, b) for a, b in step6_pairs]\n    \n    for a, b in all_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a+1} {b+1}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and the strings representing left and right boots.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Each boot is categorized into fixed (specific color) or wildcard ('?') lists, storing their indices.\n3. **Fixed Boot Matching**: For each color, the algorithm matches left and right boots of the same color, recording these pairs.\n4. **Wildcard Matching**: Any remaining fixed boots are matched with wildcards from the opposite side. Leftover wildcards are then paired together.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices (converted to 1-based indexing).\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging frequency matching and greedy strategies, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
