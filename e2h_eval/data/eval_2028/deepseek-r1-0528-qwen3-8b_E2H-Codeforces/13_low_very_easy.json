For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the list of 12 notes). But note: the problem lists the notes as starting with C and then going up to H (which is B in some systems, but here H is the last). However, the example input includes 'A B H' and the note after H is C.\n\n Let's define the list of notes in order (from C to the next C, so 12 notes):\n   notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n But wait: the example says \"after H goes C\", so we have 12 distinct notes. However, the example input also includes 'C# B F'. Note that 'B' and 'H' are different? Actually, the example input uses both 'B' and 'H'. \n\n According to the problem: the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n So, the mapping should be:\n   'C' -> 0\n   'C#' -> 1\n   'D' -> 2\n   'D#' -> 3\n   'E' -> 4\n   'F' -> 5\n   'F#' -> 6\n   'G' -> 7\n   'G#' -> 8\n   'A' -> 9\n   'B' -> 10\n   'H' -> 11\n\n However, note the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break it down:\n\n   Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n\n We need to consider the cyclic nature. The distance between two notes can be computed by taking the absolute difference modulo 12, but we have to account for circularity.\n\n Actually, the problem states: the distance from the lowest to the highest. But in the example, they reordered the notes.\n\n How to compute the distance between two notes?\n   Let a and b be two notes (as numbers). Then the distance from a to b (going upwards) is:\n     (b - a) % 12, but if we go from a higher note to a lower one, we might wrap around.\n\n However, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest. But when forming a chord, we can reorder the notes arbitrarily.\n\n Approach:\n   We are given three distinct notes? The problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes.\n\n Steps for the solution:\n\n 1. Map the input notes to their numerical values.\n 2. Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the chord is unordered, we'll check all orders).\n 3. For a permutation (x, y, z), we require that the distances (in semitones) from x to y and y to z are such that:\n      In major: (distance from x to y = 4) and (distance from y to z = 3) [so total from x to z would be 7]\n      In minor: (distance from x to y = 3) and (distance from y to z = 4) [so total from x to z would be 7]\n\n But note: the entire circle is 12 semitones. The distance from x to y (if we go forward) is (y - x) mod 12, but if y < x, then we can do (y - x + 12) mod 12? Actually, the problem says from the lowest to the highest. But in the example, they say the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Wait, that doesn't fit because from E (4) to C (0) going upward: \n      E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C -> that's 8 semitones.\n\n However, in our system, if we have two notes a and b, then the forward distance from a to b (without wrapping) is (b - a) % 12, but if (b - a) is negative, we can adjust by adding 12. Alternatively, we can compute the minimal positive distance that covers the ascending path.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they can be ordered in a way that matches the specific distance requirements for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the sequence of 12 distinct notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations. This is necessary because the chord can be reordered in any way, and we need to check each possible order to determine the chord type.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distances between consecutive notes. For a major chord, the distance from x to y should be 4 semitones and from y to z should be 3 semitones. For a minor chord, the distance from x to y should be 3 semitones and from y to z should be 4 semitones.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    input_str = input().split()\n    num_notes = [notes_list.index(note) for note in input_str]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(num_notes):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        dist_ab = (b - a) % 12\n        dist_bc = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        total_dist_ac = (dist_ab + dist_bc) % 12\n        if dist_ab == 4 and dist_bc == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif dist_ab == 3 and dist_bc == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The list `notes_list` contains all 12 distinct notes in order. Each note in the input is converted to its corresponding index in this list, which gives a numerical representation (0 to 11).\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orders of the three input notes are generated. This allows us to check every possible sequence of the three notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale. The distance from note A to note B is `(B - A) % 12`, ensuring the result is always positive.\n4. **Chord Condition Check**: The conditions for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) and a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) are checked for each permutation. If either condition is met, the corresponding flag is set.\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the flags, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met. The problem guarantees that no chord is both major and minor, so the output is unambiguous.",
