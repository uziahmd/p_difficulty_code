    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element might change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` (after sorting). Then the overall instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n However, by removing one element, we have two possibilities:\n  1. Remove an occurrence that is the current minimum (but not necessarily all minimums)\n  2. Remove an occurrence that is the current maximum (but not necessarily all maximums)\n\n But note: we might also remove an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum, but then the min and max remain the same.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal could be:\n   Option 1: If we remove an element that is the minimum, then the new min might be the next smallest number (if there was more than one minimum) OR if there was only one minimum then the min becomes the next smallest.\n\n However, we can consider two cases for removal that might lead to a lower instability:\n\n Case 1: Removing an element that is the minimum value. Then the new array's min becomes the smallest value that is greater than the old minimum (if exists) and the max remains the same. So the instability becomes (max) - (next_min_after_old_min).\n\n Case 2: Removing an element that is the maximum value. Then the new array's max becomes the largest value that is less than the old maximum, and the min remains the same. So the instability becomes (next_max_before_old_max) - (min).\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains the original.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the minimum among:\n   original_instability (if we remove an element that doesn't affect min or max) \n   but actually we are allowed to remove any one element. We want to minimize the instability.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n Possibilities for the new array:\n\n 1. Remove the first element (min): then the new array has min = sorted_a[1] (if n>1) and max = sorted_a[-1]. Instability = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]\n\n 2. Remove the last element (max): then the new array has min = sorted_a[0] and max = sorted_a[-2]. Instability = sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0]\n\n 3. Remove an element in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original: sorted_a[-1]-sorted_a[0].\n\n However, note: we might have duplicate values. For example, if the array has multiple minima, then removing one minimum might not change the min. Similarly for maxima.\n\n But note: the above two cases (removing first or last) are sufficient because:\n\n - Removing a non-minimum and non-maximum element leaves the min and max unchanged -> same as original.\n - Removing a minimum that is duplicated: then the min doesn't change (because there's still at least one minimum) and the max remains the same. So the instability is still the original? \n\n Let me clarify with an example: [1,1,3,7]. Original instability = 6.\n\n If we remove one of the 1's (the first one), the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n If we remove the other 1, the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n However, if we remove the first element (which is 1) then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n But wait, the above two cases (removing first or last) are only considering the endpoints. What if we remove a duplicate minimum that is not at the beginning? Actually, the array is sorted. The duplicates are adjacent.\n\n So we must consider:\n\n  - Removing an element that is the minimum (any occurrence of the minimum) but note that if there are multiple minima, then even if we remove one, the min doesn't change (so the instability remains the same as the original) unless we remove the only minimum.\n\n Actually, the key is: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. We want to minimize the instability.\n\n The instability is defined as max - min. The min and max of the entire array are fixed until we remove an element that is the min or the max.\n\n Therefore, the only chance to reduce the instability is to remove an element that is either the global minimum or the global maximum (or perhaps both, if the array has only two elements and they are the same, then removing any one will leave one element, but note: the problem says \"exactly one element\", and the resulting array has n-1 elements, which is at least 1).\n\n However,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: The first step is to sort the given array. This allows us to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: \n   - If the array has all identical elements, removing any element will result in an array with all elements being the same, leading to an instability of 0.\n3. **Evaluate Key Scenarios**:\n   - **Remove the Minimum Element**: After removing the smallest element, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element in the sorted array. The instability is then calculated as the original maximum minus this new minimum.\n   - **Remove the Maximum Element**: Similarly, after removing the largest element, the new maximum becomes the next largest element. The instability is the new maximum minus the original minimum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The solution involves comparing the instabilities obtained from the two scenarios (removing the minimum or the maximum) and choosing the smaller value. If all elements are identical, the instability is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n    \n    if arr_sorted[0] == arr_sorted[-1]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[1]\n    option2 = arr_sorted[-2] - arr_sorted[0]\n    \n    answer = min(option1, option2)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily identify the minimum (`arr_sorted[0]`) and maximum (`arr_sorted[-1]`) elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If all elements are the same, the instability after removing any element is zero, which is printed immediately.\n3. **Calculating Options**:\n   - **Option1**: Removes the smallest element, so the new instability is the difference between the original maximum and the next smallest element.\n   - **Option2**: Removes the largest element, so the new instability is the difference between the next largest element and the original minimum.\n4. **Result Determination**: The minimum value between the two options is chosen as the result, ensuring the lowest possible instability after removal.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two key scenarios, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to derive the solution with optimal performance.",
