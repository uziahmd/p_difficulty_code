The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (with clockwise order) and we start at house 1, we can move only clockwise.\n\n Important: The tasks must be done in the given order. However, note that the problem states: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\n We are allowed to move one house per unit time, and the movement is only clockwise.\n\n Observation: \n Since the ringroad is circular and we can go around multiple times, but the requirement is to do the tasks in order, we can break down the journey:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Start at house 1.\n   Then we have to go to the first task location: a1, then from a1 to a2 (but note: if a2 < a1, then we must go from a1 to a2 by going through the next houses until we reach a2, but since it's a ring we can also go from a1 -> ... -> n -> 1 -> ... -> a2? However, note the movement is only clockwise. Actually, the ringroad is built along the main road and the houses are in clockwise order 1,2,...,n. So moving clockwise from a1 to a2 is:\n\n   If a2 >= a1: then the distance is (a2 - a1)\n   If a2 < a1: then the distance is (n - a1 + a2) because we go from a1 to n, then wrap around to 1 and then to a2.\n\n But note: we might have consecutive tasks in the same house, so no movement.\n\n However, note that the entire journey might involve multiple circles. But we don't necessarily need to complete a full circle.\n\n But wait: the problem says we must complete the tasks in order. So we start at house 1, then go to the first task (which is a1). Then from a1 to a2, etc.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n\n Steps for the example:\n   Start at 1.\n   Go to 3: \n        Option1: 1->2->3: 2 steps (since 3-1 = 2, but wait: we are at 1, then next is 2 (step1), then 3 (step2)).\n        Alternatively, if we were at 3 and next task is 2: \n            From 3 to 2: we can't go backwards. So we go 3->4->1->2: that's 3 steps.\n\n   So total: 2 (for first task) + 3 (from 3 to 2) + (from 2 to 3: 2->3: 1 step) = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n But wait, the example says the optimal sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3, which is 6 steps.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" for the i-th task. This means that the order of the tasks is fixed, and we must do them in increasing index order.\n\n But note: the example input has the second task being 2, which is before the current house 3? So we must leave house 3 and go to house 2.\n\n However, there's a catch: the problem does not require that we stay at the last task location for the next one. We have to complete the tasks in order.\n\n Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   For each task in the list of tasks:\n        while current != task:\n            current = (current % n) + 1   # This would move to the next house, but note: if current is n, then next is 1.\n            total_time += 1\n\n   But wait, let's test with the example: [3,2,3] and n=4.\n\n   Step1: current=1, task=3 -> we move 1->2 (time=1), then 2->3 (time=2). Now current=3, total_time=2.\n\n   Step2: current=3, task=2 -> we move 3->4 (time=3), 4->1 (time=4), 1->2 (time=5). Now current=2, total_time=5.\n\n   Step3: current=2, task=3 -> we move 2->3 (time=6). total_time=6.\n\n   This matches.\n\n However, the constraints are up to 10^5 houses and 10^5 tasks. The above",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad with houses numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task location in the given list:\n   - If the current house is not the same as the task location, calculate the steps needed to move clockwise from the current house to the task location.\n   - The movement can be broken down into two scenarios:\n     - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current house, the steps required are `(task_location - current_house)`.\n     - If the task location is less than the current house, the steps required are `(n - current_house + task_location)` because Xenia has to go from the current house to the end of the ring (house n) and then continue from house 1 to the task location.\n3. **Update Current Position**: After reaching the task location, update the current position to the task location for the next iteration.\n4. **Sum Time**: Accumulate the time taken for each movement step.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the ringroad by considering the direct path in the clockwise direction, ensuring minimal time is used for each movement between tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for task in tasks:\n        if current == task:\n            continue\n            \n        if task >= current:\n            total_time += task - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + task\n            \n        current = task\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses (n), the number of tasks (m), and the list of task locations.\n- **Task Processing Loop**: For each task location:\n  - If the current house matches the task location, no movement is needed.\n  - If the task location is ahead of the current house (or equal), the time taken is simply the difference between the task location and the current house.\n  - If the task location is behind the current house (i.e., requires wrapping around the ring), the time taken is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring and then from the start of the ring to the task location.\n- **Output**: The total accumulated time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular structure and straightforward arithmetic to handle movements, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
