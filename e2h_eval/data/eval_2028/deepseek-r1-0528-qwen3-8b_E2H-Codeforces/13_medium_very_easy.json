For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the list of 12 notes). But note: the problem lists the notes as starting with C and then going up to H (which is B in some systems, but here H is the last). However, the example includes H and the next note after H is C.\n\n 2. We have two ways to handle the circularity: we can consider the circle of 12 notes.\n\n Let's define the list of notes in order:\n   notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n However, note the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break down the example:\n\n   Input: \"C# B F\"\n\n   We need to reorder them. The example says: order as \"B\", \"C#\", \"F\".\n\n   First, let's map the notes to numbers:\n\n   notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n   Then:\n     B -> index 10, C# -> index 1, F -> index 5.\n\n   Now, we want to check if there exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n      distance(x, y) = 3 semitones for minor? Actually, wait: the definition says:\n\n   Minor: \n        Ordering: X, Y, Z such that:\n          distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n          distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n   But note: the example reorders the input to get the sequence. So we must consider all permutations.\n\n   However, note: the chord is unordered. So we have 3! = 6 permutations. But we can also consider circular shifts and the fact that the distances are defined along the musical scale (so we can wrap around?).\n\n   But note: the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". That means the distance is measured from the lower to the higher, and if we cross an octave, then we take the shortest way? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are going up the scale. However, when we have three distinct notes, we can arrange them in increasing order (without crossing the octave boundary?).\n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify if we can wrap around. But note: the example \"C E G\": \n        C to E: 4 semitones (C->C#->D->D#->E: 4 steps)\n        E to G: 3 semitones (E->F->F#->G: 3 steps)\n\n   And the example \"C# B F\": \n        They ordered as B, C#, F.\n        B to C#: 1 step (because after B comes C, then C#? But wait, the list goes: ... A, B, H? Wait, wait, the problem says: the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again.\n\n   Let me clarify the note list: \n        The problem says: \"there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n   This is unusual because typically we have B and then C, but here they use H for the last one. So the list is:\n\n        Index 0: C\n        Index 1: C#\n        Index 2: D\n        Index 3: D#\n        Index 4: E\n        Index 5: F\n        Index 6: F#\n        Index 7: G\n        Index 8: G#\n        Index 9: A\n        Index 10: B\n        Index 11: H\n\n   But wait, the example says: \"C# B F\" becomes \"B\", \"C#\", \"F\". Then we must compute the distances from B to C# and C# to F.\n\n   From B (index 10) to C# (index 1): \n        If we go from B to the next note, which is H (index 11) and then wraps to C (index0) and then C# (index1), then the distance from B to C# is (from index10 to index1): \n        Option 1: Going forward: from index10 to index11 (1 semitone) then from index11 to index0 (another 1? but wait, no: actually, the circle is 12, so from 10 to 1: \n        We can compute the distance by: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 -> modulo 12: (-9 + 12) % 12 = 3. So that matches.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define a function that computes the distance between two notes without wrapping (if we don't allow wrapping) but the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. So we should consider the entire circle. But note: the chord is a set of three distinct notes. We must arrange the three notes in increasing order (by their pitch) without crossing the octave boundary? Or do we consider the circle?\n\n   However, the example \"E to C\": \n        E is at index4, C is at index0. \n        How many semitones from E to C? \n        One way: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: 8 semitones.\n        But wait, the circle has 12 semitones, so the other way is 12-8=4, but the problem says 8.\n\n   So the rule: the distance from note A to note B is the smallest non-negative number of semitones to go from A to B in the upward direction (without going backward) until we reach B? But wait, the example says from E to C is 8, meaning we are going from E to F to ... to C (which is the next C) and that is 8 steps.\n\n   However, in music, the chord is defined on the same octave or spanning octaves? Actually, the problem states: the notes are repeated cyclically, and we identify the C at the beginning and the C after H. So the distance from E to C (the next C) is 8 semitones.\n\n   Therefore, we are always measuring the distance in the positive direction (going up the scale) without wrapping the circle in the sense of taking the shortest path? Actually, no: the distance from E to C is 8, which is more than half the circle (half is 6). So we are not taking the shortest path. \n\n   But wait, the definition of the chord requires specific intervals: 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). These intervals are 4 and 3, which are less than 6, so they are within the same octave or one octave? Actually, the major triad: 4 semitones and then 3 semitones gives 7 semitones from the first to the last, which is less than 12.\n\n   However, the problem says: the distance from E to C is 8, meaning that we are allowed to span an octave. But the chord definitions only require intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) semitones, which are less than 7 (so they are within one octave). \n\n   But wait, what if the chord spans an octave? For example, if we have notes E, F, and then the next C? That would be a different chord. However, the problem states that the chord is an unordered set of three notes.\n\n   Important: We must consider all possible orderings that are increasing (in pitch) and without skipping an octave? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but the examples don't require wrapping.\n\n   Approach:\n\n   We have three distinct notes. We can map them to three indices (from 0 to 11). Then, we can consider the circle of 12.\n\n   Since the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals (in the ordering) being 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor), we can try all 6 permutations and check for two conditions:\n\n   Condition for major: \n        There exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n            (distance(a, b) == 4 and distance(b, c) == 3) OR \n            (distance(a, b) == 4 and distance(b, c) == 3) [but note: the definition says we order the notes so that the first two have 4 and then 3]\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n   However, note: the entire chord is defined by three notes. The condition does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the circle. It just requires that there is an ordering (which might not be the natural ascending order without wrapping) such that the two intervals are 4 and 3.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that the ordering must be from low to high? \n\n   Actually, the example \"C E G\": \n        C, E, G: \n        C is the lowest, then E, then G.\n\n   The example \"C# B F\": \n        They say order as B, C#, F. \n        In the circle: \n          B is at index10, then C# is at index1 (which is higher than B? because the circle goes: ... B, then the next is H (index11) and then C (index0) and then C# (index1). So in terms of pitch, B is the lowest? Actually, no: the note after B is H (which is the highest in the list) and then C. But wait, the problem says: the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C. So the order is: ... , B, H, C, C#, ... \n\n   However, the example says: from B to C# is 3 semitones. But in the circle, from B to H is 1 semitone (because B to H is the next note), and then from H to C is 1 more (because H to C is the next), and then from C to C# is 1. So from B to C# is 3 semitones.\n\n   But in terms of pitch, if we are going from B to C# we are going up. However, the note B is at index10, and the next note is H (index11) and then C (index0) and then C# (index1). So the pitch increases from B to H to C to C#. But wait, that would mean that H is higher than B? Then why is B the lowest in the chord? \n\n   Let me compare the absolute pitches: \n        The problem doesn't assign absolute pitches, but the relative positions. However, the chord is defined by the intervals. The condition is about the distances. \n\n   Clarification: The problem says \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones\" and \"the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\", regardless of the absolute position.\n\n   But wait, the example \"C# B F\" is minor. The ordering they chose is B, C#, F. \n\n   How do we compute the distance from B to C#? \n        We have two ways: \n            Forward: from B to H (1 semitone) then H to C (1 semitone) then C to C# (1 semitone) -> total 3.\n            Backward: from B to A (1 semitone) to G# (1) to G (1) to F# (1) to F (1) to E (1) to D# (1) to D (1) to C# (1) -> 9 semitones.\n\n        However, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the uppest. In the ordering B, C#, F, we must have B < C# < F in pitch. \n\n        But wait, in standard pitch, the notes are arranged as: ... A, B, C, ... so B is higher than A, but then C is higher than B. However, in this problem, the note after B is H (which is the highest in the list) and then C. So the pitch order is: ... A, B, H, C, C#, ... \n\n        This is confusing. Actually, the problem states: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H.\" So the order is cyclic, but the absolute pitch increases as we go from C, C#, D, ... to H, and then back to C (which is one octave higher). \n\n        Therefore, the absolute pitch of the notes (if we consider one octave) is:\n\n            C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n        Then, the next note after H (11) is C (12, which is 0 mod12). \n\n        So the pitch of H is 11, and the pitch of C is 0 (but 0 is lower than 11? No, in an octave, 12Tones: 0 to 11, then 12 is the next octave and is equivalent to 0). \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n            E is at 4, C is at 0. \n            The distance from E to C (if we go up) is: from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,0 -> that's 8 semitones.\n\n        But wait, that means that the absolute pitch of C is lower than E? Then how can we have an ordering from low to high? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not use the absolute pitch but the circular representation. \n\n        We have two ways to compare two notes: \n            We can compare their base indices (0 to 11) but then we must account for the circle.\n\n        The problem's distance definition: \n            The distance from note A to note B is the number of semitones you have to go from A to reach B when moving upward (in the positive direction of the circle) without going backward.\n\n        So, if we have two notes with indices a and b (both in 0..11), the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if b < a then we add 12: so distance = (b - a) % 12, but if negative, we do (b - a + 12) % 12? \n\n        Actually, the example E(4) to C(0): \n            (0 - 4) = -4, then (-4 + 12) % 12 = 8. Correct.\n\n        Similarly, from B(10) to C#(1): \n            (1 - 10) = -9, then (-9 + 12) % 12 = 3.\n\n        So the distance formula: \n            def dist(a, b):\n                d = (b - a) % 12\n                if d < 0:\n                    d += 12\n                return d % 12   # but wait, modulo 12 already gives the positive residue, but our calculation above: (b-a) % 12 might give negative? Actually, in Python, % returns non-negative if modulus is positive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            But wait, the modulus operation for negative: \n                In Python: (b - a) % 12 will give a result between 0 and 11.\n\n        Example: (1 - 10) % 12 = (-9) % 12 = 3 (because -9 + 12 = 3, and 3 % 12 is 3). \n\n        So we can compute the distance from a to b as: (b - a) % 12, but note: if the result is negative, the modulus operation in Python will adjust it to be positive. However, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n            a % b returns a result in the range [0, b-1].\n\n        But wait, what if we do (a - b) % 12? That would be the backward distance. We want the forward distance (from a to b going up).\n\n        So the forward distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12, but if (b - a) is negative, then (b - a) % 12 is (b - a + 12) % 12, which is the same as (b - a + 12) if (b - a) is negative and >= -11.\n\n        However, note: the chord condition does not require that the entire set of three notes fits in one octave. The intervals are fixed: 4 and 3 (total 7) or 3 and 4 (total 7). \n\n        So we can compute the distance between two notes by: \n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            But wait, if we have two notes, we can also compute the other direction (12 - d) for the backward distance, but the problem uses the forward distance.\n\n        However, the condition for the chord: \n            We need two consecutive intervals (in the chosen ordering) to be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        But note: the entire chord spans 7 semitones (from X to Z). \n\n        However, the problem does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the circle. They are just three distinct notes.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Map the input notes to their index (0-11) using the list: \n            notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n        2. Get the three indices: say [a, b, c]\n\n        3. Generate all 6 permutations of these three indices.\n\n        4. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute:\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12   [forward distance from x to y]\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12   [forward distance from y to z]\n\n            Then, we require that the entire chord is considered from x to y to z. But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the uppest. In our circle, the ordering (x,y,z) must be in increasing pitch? \n\n            However, the problem does not specify the starting note. But the definition of the chord requires that there exists an ordering (which may not be the sorted order) such that the distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n            But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n                They used the ordering [B, C#, F] -> [10, 1, 5]. \n                d1 = (1 - 10) % 12 = 3\n                d2 = (5 - 1) % 12 = 4\n                So that matches minor.\n\n            However, if we take the same set and order it as [B, F, C#]:\n                d1 = (5 - 10) % 12 = (5-10) = -5 %12 = 7\n                d2 = (1 - 5) % 12 = (1-5) = -4 %12 = 8 -> not matching.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"we can order the notes\", meaning we can choose any order. However, the ordering must be such that the distances are computed from the lower to the higher. But wait, in the example they chose an ordering that starts at B and then goes to C# and then to F. \n\n            But is B the lowest? In our absolute numbering (0 to 11) for one octave, B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. \n            However, in the circle, the pitch of B (10) is higher than F (5)? Because 10>5? But wait, the circle: 0 to 11, then 12 (same as 0). So the absolute pitch (modulo 12) doesn't tell the full story. \n\n            Actually, we have to consider the entire circle. The problem considers the notes as repeating. But the ordering from low to high in pitch must be the one that goes without wrapping? Or with wrapping?\n\n            The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n            How do we determine the lowest and the highest? \n\n            We have three distinct notes. We can arrange them in increasing order of pitch (mod12) but considering the circularity? \n\n            Actually, the typical way to arrange a set of notes in a circle is to sort them by their pitch (which is the index) and then consider the gaps. But wait, the chord definition does not require the entire set to be within one octave. \n\n            However, the intervals required (4 and 3) are small enough to fit in one octave (since 4+3=7 < 12). \n\n            But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n                The three notes: B(10), C#(1), F(5). \n                The sorted order (without considering circle) would be [1,5,10] -> C#, F, B. \n                Then the distances: \n                    from C# to F: (5-1)%12 = 4\n                    from F to B: (10-5)%12 = 5 -> not 3.\n\n                Alternatively, if we consider the circle, we might break the circle and arrange the notes so that we don't wrap? \n\n            The problem does not specify that the three notes must lie within one octave. \n\n            However, the condition for the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals (in the chosen ordering) being 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). The entire chord spans 7 semitones. \n\n            The key: we are allowed to choose any ordering (any starting note and then the next two) as long as the distances (computed by the forward method) are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n            But note: the example \"C# B F\" was ordered as [B, C#, F]. In this ordering, the entire sequence of three notes is not contiguous in the circle without wrapping. \n\n            How did they get that? They started at B (10) and then went to C# (1) and then F (5). \n\n            The condition only requires that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (or vice versa). It doesn't require that the entire set is contiguous or that the three notes are consecutive in the circle.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply check all 6 permutations (each permutation gives an ordering of the three notes) and see if there is an ordering (x, y, z) for which:\n\n                (y - x) % 12 = 4 and (z - y) % 12 = 3   --> major\n                or \n                (y - x) % 12 = 3 and (z - y) % 12 = 4   --> minor\n\n            However, wait: what if the ordering is not the natural ascending order? \n\n            Example: [C, E, G] for major: \n                Ordering: C, E, G -> \n                (E - C) % 12 = (4 - 0) %12 = 4\n                (G - E) %12 = (7 - 4) %12 = 3 -> major.\n\n            Example: [C, D, F] for minor? \n                Let me check: \n                Ordering: C, D, F -> \n                (D-C)=2, (F-D)= (5-2)=3 -> not 3 and 4.\n                Ordering: C, F, D -> \n                (F-C)=5, (D-F)= (2-5) %12 = (2-5+12)=9 -> no.\n                Ordering: D, C, F -> \n                (C-D)= (0-2)%12=10, (F-C)=5 -> no.\n                Ordering: D, F, C -> \n                (F-D)=3, (C-F)= (0-5)%12=7 -> no.\n                Ordering: F, C, D -> \n                (C-F)= (0-5)%12=7, (D-C)=2 -> no.\n                Ordering: F, D, C -> \n                (D-F)= (2-5)%12=9, (C-D)=10 -> no.\n\n            So [C, D, F] is strange.\n\n            But wait, is [C, D, F] a minor chord? No, minor chord requires root, then minor third (3 semitones) and then perfect fifth (7 semitones from root). \n\n            Actually, the minor chord is built as: root, root+3, root+7. So for C: C, Eb (which is D? wait, no: D is 2 semitones from C, so that's a major second. \n\n            So [C, D, F] is not a standard minor chord.\n\n            Therefore, the plan:\n\n            - Map the input to three indices (0-11).\n            - Generate all 6 permutations of these three indices.\n            - For each permutation (x, y, z):\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n                Then, the entire chord from x to z is d1+d2, but the condition is only on the two consecutive intervals.\n\n            However, note: the condition does not require that the entire set is within one octave. But the intervals are fixed (4 and 3) and 4+3=7, which is less than 12, so the entire chord spans 7 semitones. \n\n            But wait: what if the two intervals are not consecutive in the circle? Actually, the condition is on two consecutive intervals in the ordering. \n\n            However, we are allowed to choose any ordering. \n\n            But note: the problem says \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n            This means that we are forming a chain: X -> Y -> Z, and the entire chain from X to Z is 7 semitones. \n\n            But the entire circle is 12, so if we have three notes, there are two ways to go from X to Z: one of length 7 and the other of length 5 (12-7=5). However, the condition specifies the forward distance (the one that goes up) for each interval.\n\n            Example: [C, E, G] is 4 and 3 -> 7 total. \n            Another example: [C, E, Ab] (which is a minor chord?) Wait, let me check: \n                Major chord: root, major third (4 semitones), perfect fifth (7 semitones from root).\n                Minor chord: root, minor third (3 semitones), perfect fifth (7 semitones from root).\n\n            But wait, [C, E, Ab] is not a minor chord. The minor chord for C would be C, Eb, G. \n\n            So our method: we are checking the consecutive intervals in the chosen ordering.\n\n            However, note: the problem does not require that the entire chord is built from the root. It only requires that there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n            But the standard major chord is built from the root (X) to the third (Y) to the fifth (Z). And the intervals are 4 and 3. \n\n            Similarly, minor: root to minor third (3) and then to fifth (4). \n\n            However, the example \"C# B F\" is minor. What are the intervals from the root? \n\n            Root is B (which is the first note in the ordering). Then the next is C# (which is 3 semitones from B) and then F (which is 4 semitones from C#). \n\n            So the root is B, the minor third is C# (B to C# is 3 semitones) and the fifth is F (from B: 3+4=7 semitones). \n\n            But wait, the standard minor chord for B would be: B, C#, F? \n\n            Actually, the standard minor chord for B is: B, C#, F? Let me check:\n\n            B to C# is 3 semitones (minor third) and then from C# to F: \n                F is 5 semitones above B? \n                B: 10, F:5 -> (5-10)%12=7, but wait, that's the entire distance from B to F? \n\n            Actually, the chord is built by adding the fifth (which is 7 semitones above the root). From B (root) to the fifth: \n                The fifth for B is F? \n\n            Standard: \n                Major chord: root, root+4, root+7.\n                Minor chord: root, root+3, root+7.\n\n            For B (index10): \n                root+3: 10+3 = 13 -> 1 (C#) -> correct.\n                root+7: 10+7 = 17 -> 17 %12 = 5 -> F. \n\n            So yes, [B, C#, F] is the minor chord for B.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the intervals (from X to Y) is either 3 or 4 and the next interval (from Y to Z) is the complement (4 or 3) so that the entire chord from X to Z is 7.\n\n            But note: the condition does not require that the root is the first note? Actually, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\", meaning that the root is X. \n\n            However, the chord is an unordered set. So the root might not be the one we start with. \n\n            But wait, the standard definition: the chord has a root. However, the problem does not specify which note is the root. \n\n            Actually, the condition for major: \n                There exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3.\n\n            This implies that X is the root, because then the chord is built as: root, root+4, root+7.\n\n            Similarly, minor: root, root+3, root+7.\n\n            But note: the chord is defined by the set, and the root is determined by the ordering. \n\n            Therefore, we must check for the existence of a root (one of the three) such that the other two notes are at 4 and 7 (for major) or 3 and 7 (for minor) from the root? \n\n            Actually, the condition is: \n                Major: There exists a root R such that the set contains R, R+4, R+7 (all mod12).\n                Minor: There exists a root R such that the set contains R, R+3, R+7 (all mod12).\n\n            Why? Because the entire chord must be {R, R+4, R+7} for major and {R, R+3, R+7} for minor.\n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n            For each note in the set as candidate root R:\n                Check if the set contains R, (R+4)%12, (R+7)%12 for major.\n                Check if the set contains R, (R+3)%12, (R+7)%12 for minor.\n\n            However, note: the set has exactly three distinct notes. \n\n            Example: [C, E, G] for major: \n                Candidate root C (0): \n                    R+4 = 4 (E), R+7 = 7 (G) -> set {0,4,7} -> matches.\n\n            Example: [C, E, G] for minor? \n                Candidate root C: \n                    R+3=3 (D#) -> not in the set, and R+7=7 (G) -> but we have E and G, but missing D#. So no.\n\n            Example: [C, Eb, G] for minor: \n                Eb is D# -> index 3.\n                Candidate root C (0): \n                    R+3=3 (Eb), R+7=7 (G) -> set {0,3,7} -> matches.\n\n            Example: [C# B F] for minor: \n                The set: {10,1,5}\n                Candidate root B (10): \n                    R+3 = 13 %12=1 -> present (C#)\n                    R+7 = 17 %12=5 -> present (F)\n                    So yes.\n\n                Candidate root C# (1):\n                    R+3=4 -> E, not in set; R+7=8 -> G#, not in set.\n\n                Candidate root F (5):\n                    R+3=8 -> G#, not in set; R+7=12%12=0 -> C, not in set.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input to three indices: a, b, c.\n\n            Step 2: Let S = {a, b, c}\n\n            Step 3: For each candidate root r in S:\n                Let m3 = (r+3) % 12\n                Let m7 = (r+7) % 12\n                Let M3 = (r+4) % 12\n                Let M7 = (r+7) % 12   [same as minor's seventh]\n\n                Then for minor: check if {r, m3, m7} == S.\n                Then for major: check if {r, M3, M7} == S.\n\n            However, note: the set S must contain exactly these three. But what if the set has three notes and the candidate root produces three notes that are not necessarily distinct? \n\n            Since 3 and 4 are less than 12, and 7 is less than 12, and the root is distinct from the others (unless there is a duplicate, but the input has three distinct notes), we are safe.\n\n            But wait: what if the chord is major and we consider the root as one of the notes, but the set {r, r+4, r+7} might have duplicates? \n                Only if 4==0 or 7==0 mod12, which is not the case.\n\n            However, there is a caveat: the set S might have three notes that form a major chord, but also form a minor chord with a different root? \n\n            The problem states: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\"\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            Initialize:\n                is_major = False\n                is_minor = False\n\n            For each candidate r in the set S:\n                if the set {r, (r+3)%12, (r+7)%12} equals S:\n                    is_minor = True\n                if the set {r, (r+4)%12, (r+7)%12} equals S:\n                    is_major = True\n\n            Then:\n                if is_major and not is_minor: print \"major\"\n                elif is_minor and not is_major: print \"minor\"\n                else: print \"strange\"\n\n            But wait, the example [C, E, G] is major. \n                Candidate root C: {0, (0+3)%12=3, (0+7)%12=7} -> {0,3,7",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible roots of the chord and verifying if the intervals between the notes match the standard definitions of major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index (0 to 11) based on its position in the sequence of 12 musical notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Checking Chord Types**: For each note in the input set, consider it as a potential root of the chord. Then, check if the other two notes in the set match the intervals required for a minor or major chord:\n   - **Minor Chord**: The intervals from the root should be 3 semitones (minor third) and 7 semitones (perfect fifth).\n   - **Major Chord**: The intervals from the root should be 4 semitones (major third) and 7 semitones (perfect fifth).\n3. **Decision Making**: If the set of notes matches the intervals of a minor chord for any root, output \"minor\". Similarly, if it matches the intervals of a major chord for any root, output \"major\". If neither condition is met, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    data = input().split()\n    indices = [notes_list.index(note) for note in data]\n    s = set(indices)\n    \n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n    \n    for r in s:\n        minor_set = {r, (r + 3) % 12, (r + 7) % 12}\n        major_set = {r, (r + 4) % 12, (r + 7) % 12}\n        \n        if minor_set == s:\n            is_minor = True\n            \n        if major_set == s:\n            is_major = True\n            \n    if is_major and not is_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor and not is_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by defining a list of musical notes in order. Each note in the input is converted to its corresponding index in this list.\n2. **Set Creation**: The indices of the input notes are stored in a set for easy comparison.\n3. **Chord Check**: For each note in the set, the code checks if the other two notes match the intervals required for a minor or major chord. This is done by calculating the expected indices for the minor third and perfect fifth (or major third) from the current root and verifying if these indices exist in the input set.\n4. **Output Decision**: Based on the checks, the code determines if the chord is major, minor, or neither and prints the result accordingly. The problem guarantees that no chord is both major and minor, so the solution can unambiguously classify each input.",
