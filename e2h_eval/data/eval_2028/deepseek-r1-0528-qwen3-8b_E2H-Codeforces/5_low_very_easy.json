Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters). We have to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot) such that:\n - Two specific colors (non '?') must be the same.\n - An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any.\n\n However, note: a boot can be used at most once.\n\n We cannot use the same boot in more than one pair.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are to output the maximum number of pairs and then list the pairs (by their indices).\n\n Observation:\n\n Since the problem asks for the maximum number of pairs, we want to use as many boots as possible.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can consider two types of boots: those that are fixed (non '?') and those that are '?'.\n\n 2. We can break down the problem:\n\n    a. First, let's count the frequency of each color (from 'a' to 'z') in the left and right boots that are fixed.\n\n    b. Then, we can form pairs between fixed boots that match. For example, if there are 3 'a' in left fixed and 5 'a' in right fixed, we can form 3 pairs.\n\n    c. But note: we also have the possibility to use the '?' boots to complete the remaining boots (both fixed and some '?' that don't get matched by fixed ones) but wait: actually, the '?' can match any.\n\n    However, note: the problem requires maximum matching. We can also use '?' to match with other '?' or with fixed colors.\n\n    Actually, we can think greedily:\n\n    Let's denote:\n        Let L_fixed: dictionary for fixed left boots (non '?')\n        Let R_fixed: dictionary for fixed right boots (non '?')\n\n    Then, for each color c:\n        The number of pairs we can form from fixed boots for color c is min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c])\n\n    Then, we remove these from the fixed counts.\n\n    Now, we have two sets of leftover boots: \n        Leftover_left: all left boots that are either fixed but not matched or are '?'\n        Leftover_right: all right boots that are either fixed but not matched or are '?'\n\n    But note: the '?' boots are also present and they can match any.\n\n    However, we cannot simply match all the leftover '?' because we have to respect the original counts.\n\n    But wait: we are allowed to use a '?' in a pair with a fixed one, or with another '?'.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can form pairs in two ways:\n\n        Type 1: both boots are fixed and match.\n        Type 2: one boot is fixed and the other is '?'.\n        Type 3: both boots are '?'.\n\n    However, we must maximize the total pairs.\n\n    But note: we have two separate strings for left and right.\n\n    We can use a bipartite graph? However, n can be up to 150000, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n    Insight:\n\n    We can first form pairs of fixed matching (Type 1). Then, we are left with:\n\n        Left: \n            fixed_remaining = {c: count} for each fixed color that was not fully matched, and also the '?' (which we can treat as a wildcard)\n        Right: similarly.\n\n    Then, we can use the wildcards ('?') to match with any unmatched fixed boots (if there are any). But note: we can also use the wildcards to match with each other.\n\n    However, the problem is: how many pairs can we form with the wildcards?\n\n    Let:\n\n        Let L_wild = number of '?' in left\n        Let R_wild = number of '?' in right\n\n    After matching fixed boots (Type 1), we have:\n\n        Let L_fixed_remaining = L_fixed - the number of fixed left boots that were matched (but actually we already removed the matched ones for each color)\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            Total left boots = n\n            Fixed left boots = count of non '?' in l\n            Similarly for right.\n\n        But note: we don't necessarily know which fixed boots are left.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Count the fixed boots and the wildcards.\n\n        Step 2: For each color c from 'a' to 'z', the maximum fixed pairs for color c is min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]). Then subtract these from both L_fixed and R_fixed.\n\n        Step 3: Now, we have:\n\n            Left: \n                fixed_left = {c: count} (for non-matched fixed left)\n                wild_left = count of '?' in left\n\n            Similarly for right.\n\n        But note: the non-matched fixed boots are still fixed (they are a specific color) and can be matched by a '?' from the opposite side.\n\n        So, the remaining fixed boots (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of boots with matching colors or one or both boots having an indefinite color ('?'). The solution involves efficiently matching boots while respecting the constraints that each boot can be used at most once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors. A fixed color (non '?') must match exactly with another fixed color. An indefinite color '?' can match any color. The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main steps:\n   - **Fixed Color Matching**: First, match all pairs where both boots have fixed colors that are identical. This is done by counting occurrences of each fixed color in both left and right boots and pairing them up.\n   - **Wildcard Handling**: After matching fixed colors, handle the remaining boots (both fixed and wildcards). Wildcards can be used to match any remaining fixed boots or other wildcards. The key insight is that after matching fixed colors, the remaining wildcards can be paired among themselves or with any unmatched fixed boots.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Counting**: Use dictionaries to count occurrences of each fixed color in left and right boots.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: For each color, match the minimum of its counts in left and right boots. Then, use wildcards to match any remaining fixed boots or other wildcards.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot a constant number of times, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = defaultdict(int)\n    right_fixed = defaultdict(int)\n    left_wildcards = []\n    right_wildcards = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_wildcards.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed[char] += 1\n            \n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_wildcards.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            right_fixed[char] += 1\n            \n    result_pairs = []\n    total_fixed_pairs = 0\n    for color in left_fixed:\n        if color in right_fixed:\n            count = min(left_fixed[color], right_fixed[color])\n            total_fixed_pairs += count\n            left_fixed[color] -= count\n            right_fixed[color] -= count\n            \n    remaining_left_fixed = {color: count for color, count in left_fixed.items() if count > 0}\n    remaining_right_fixed = {color: count for color, count in right_fixed.items() if count > 0}\n    \n    for color in remaining_left_fixed:\n        count_needed = remaining_left_fixed[color]\n        if color in remaining_right_fixed:\n            to_match = min(count_needed, remaining_right_fixed[color])\n            total_fixed_pairs += to_match\n            remaining_left_fixed[color] -= to_match\n            remaining_right_fixed[color] -= to_match\n            \n    for color in remaining_left_fixed:\n        if remaining_left_fixed[color] > 0:\n            total_fixed_pairs += remaining_left_fixed[color]\n            remaining_left_fixed[color] = 0\n            \n    for color in remaining_right_fixed:\n        if remaining_right_fixed[color] > 0:\n            total_fixed_pairs += remaining_right_fixed[color]\n            remaining_right_fixed[color] = 0\n            \n    total_pairs = total_fixed_pairs + len(left_wildcards) + len(right_wildcards) -
