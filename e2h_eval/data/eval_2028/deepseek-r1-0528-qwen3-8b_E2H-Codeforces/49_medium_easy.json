They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, m and then m lines each with four numbers: a, b, g, l (the two lawns connected and the gcd and lcm)\n We know that for two numbers x and y (on the two lawns), we have:\n   gcd(x, y) = g and lcm(x, y) = l.\n Also, note that for any two numbers, we have: \n   x * y = g * l   (because gcd(x,y) * lcm(x,y) = x*y)\n\n Moreover, we must have that g divides both x and y, and also that g divides l (since g divides x and y, so it divides their LCM).\n Additionally, the prime factors of g must be contained in both x and y, and the prime factors of l must be the union of the prime factors of x and y.\n\n Steps:\n 1. For each edge (a, b, g, l):\n      - Check if g * l is divisible by g? Actually, we know that x*y = g*l. But note: the condition for existence is that the gcd must divide the numbers and the lcm must be divisible by the gcd. However, there's an important condition: the gcd must divide the lcm, which it does because g divides both x and y and hence divides their LCM. Also, we must have that g divides l and that g^2 divides g*l (which is the product). But more importantly, note that x and y must be multiples of g and divisors of l (at least one of them must contain all the exponents of a prime that appear in l). Actually, from the equation: x = g * a', y = g * b', then we have:\n        lcm(x, y) = g * lcm(a', b') = l\n        => lcm(a', b') = l // g\n\n    But note: we must have that l is divisible by g. So if l % g != 0, then no solution.\n\n 2. However, even if l is divisible by g, we must also have that the product g*l is consistent with the factorizations.\n\n Alternate approach: we can use a graph to assign values to each node.\n\n Observation: Each edge gives two conditions:\n   - The value of node a and node b must be divisible by g.\n   - The value of node a and node b must be divisors of l (or at least, the product of the two is g*l, and they are multiples of g).\n\n But note: It is not necessary that the numbers are divisors of l. However, from the equation:\n        x * y = g * l\n    and x = g * a', y = g * b', then we have:\n        a' * b' = l // g\n\n    And since a' and b' are integers, we require that l is divisible by g.\n\n 3. Now, we have a system of equations for each edge. However, we have n nodes and m edges. We need to assign a number to each node such that for every edge (u, v, g, l):\n        Let x_u, x_v be the numbers on u and v.\n        Then: \n            gcd(x_u, x_v) = g\n            lcm(x_u, x_v) = l\n\n    Conditions per edge:\n        (i) g divides both x_u and x_v.\n        (ii) x_u * x_v = g * l.\n        (iii) Also, the gcd condition: the common part is exactly g. This implies that the gcd of (x_u//g, x_v//g) must be 1.\n\n    But note: from (ii) we have x_u = d1 * g, x_v = d2 * g, and d1*d2 = l//g. Then the gcd(x_u, x_v) = g * gcd(d1, d2). Therefore, we require gcd(d1, d2)=1.\n\n 4. How to solve?\n    We can try to factorize the numbers and use the constraints to set the prime exponents for each node.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let A[u] = the number for node u.\n\n        For an edge (u, v, g, l):\n            Condition 1: g divides A[u] and A[v].\n            Condition 2: A[u] * A[v] = g * l.\n            Condition 3: gcd(A[u], A[v]) = g.\n\n        From condition 3: we can write A[u] = g * a, A[v] = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = l//g.\n\n        Then the problem reduces to: we need to assign to each node a number (which is a multiple of some base divisor) and then the product condition and the coprimality condition per edge.\n\n 5. However, note that the entire graph must satisfy all edges. We can try to do:\n\n    Step 1: Check for each edge that l % g == 0. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n    Step 2: We want to assign a number to each node. We can consider that the entire assignment must have the property that for each edge (u, v, g, l): \n        Let X = A[u] and Y = A[v]. Then X*Y = g*l, and gcd(X,Y)=g.\n\n    But note: the same node may appear in multiple edges, so the value must be consistent.\n\n    Another idea: factorize g and l for each edge and then combine.\n\n    However, the constraints: n, m up to 10^6? Actually, the input says: n, m and then m lines. The numbers GCD and LCM up to 10^6.\n\n    But note: the problem says that the initial numbers were between 1 and 10^6, and now we have m edges (each edge has two numbers: GCD and LCM). The graph has n nodes (lawns) and m edges.\n\n    We cannot iterate over all primes for each edge because m can be up to 10^6 and the numbers up to 10^6.\n\n    Instead, we can think of:\n\n        Let’s define for each node i, a set (or vector) of prime exponents. But that might be too heavy.\n\n    Alternative Insight:\n\n        Since we have the product condition: A[u] * A[v] = g*l for each edge, and the gcd condition, we can consider that the entire graph must have the same prime factors? Not necessarily.\n\n        However, note: the gcd condition requires that the common part is exactly g. So for each prime p:\n\n            Let exponent in g: e_g = exponent_p(g)\n            Let exponent in A[u]: e_u, in A[v]: e_v.\n\n            Then we must have:\n                min(e_u, e_v) = e_g\n                max(e_u, e_v) = exponent_p(l)   [because LCM takes the maximum]\n\n            And for the other nodes, the exponents must be at least e_g and the maximum exponent in the connected component must be the same as the exponent in l for that prime?\n\n        However, wait: the entire graph might not be connected. But note: the problem does not say the graph is connected.\n\n        But note: each edge gives constraints only on the two nodes. So we must break the problem by connected components.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Split the graph into connected components (using the m edges). But note: we have n nodes (from 1 to n) and m edges.\n\n          2. For each connected component, we must assign numbers to the nodes such that for every edge (u,v) in the component: \n                 gcd(A[u], A[v]) = g and lcm(A[u], A[v]) = l.\n\n          3. How to assign? \n\n        We can do:\n\n          - First, for each edge, check that l % g == 0. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n          - Then, we can use the following: for each edge, we know that the product is g*l. We can try to set the value for a node by combining the information from incident edges.\n\n        However, note: the product condition is global for the edge. But the same node might be constrained by multiple edges.\n\n        Another idea: use the fact that the value for a node must be a divisor of the product of all l/g for the edges incident to it? That seems messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n\n          For each prime factor, we can consider the entire graph and the constraints on exponents.\n\n          But note: the problem is easier if we note that the entire assignment must be consistent with the following:\n\n            Let F(u) = A[u]. Then for an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n                F(u) * F(v) = g * l.\n\n            Also, the gcd condition: gcd(F(u), F(v)) = g.\n\n            We can factorize g*l for each edge and then combine the factorization for each node.\n\n        However, the constraints on the numbers (up to 10^6) and the number of edges (m up to 10^6) and nodes (n up to 10^6) make factorization too slow.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          We can use a DSU-like structure or BFS/DFS to propagate constraints.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          - We know that for each edge (u, v, g, l), the product of the two numbers is fixed: F(u) * F(v) = g*l.\n\n          - We also know that the two numbers must be multiples of g and their gcd is g.\n\n          Let d = l // g. Then we have F(u) = g * a, F(v) = g * b, with a*b = d and gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n          Now, we can assign to each node a pair (base, multiplier) but that doesn't help.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Let’s define for each node u, let X[u] = the number assigned to u.\n\n          Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l):\n              X[u] * X[v] = g*l.\n\n          We can set for one node (say root) arbitrarily? But note: the same node appears in multiple edges.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the concept of assigning a number to each node by the product of the base g and some other factor. But note: the base g is per edge, so we must have consistency.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          Since the gcd of two numbers is g, then g must divide both. Therefore, the entire graph must have the same base set of primes for the gcd? Actually, the gcd of two adjacent nodes is g, but then the gcd of two non-adjacent nodes might be different.\n\n        However, note: the gcd condition is local. But what if the graph is connected? Then the entire connected component must have a common base divisor? Actually, no: consider two edges (u,v) with g1 and (v,w) with g2. The number at v must be divisible by both g1 and g2, so the number at v must be divisible by lcm(g1, g2). But wait, the gcd condition for (u,v) is g1, so the gcd of u and v is g1. Similarly, the gcd of v and w is g2. There is no direct constraint between u and w.\n\n        But note: the product condition: for edge (u,v): u*v = g1*l1, for edge (v,w): v*w = g2*l2.\n\n        We can try to assign the value for each node by considering the product of the base from each edge, but note that the base g is the gcd, and the product is fixed.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For each edge (u, v, g, l), we know that the value of u and v must multiply to g*l. We can fix one node's value arbitrarily and then determine the others. However, the graph may have cycles and multiple paths.\n\n        How about:\n\n          Let’s take the entire graph (connected component) and fix a root node. Then we can assign the root an arbitrary value, but then we must ensure that the product conditions hold for all edges.\n\n        However, the product condition is multiplicative and the gcd condition is additive in the exponents.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use logarithmic identities? But we need exact integers.\n\n        Another known approach for such problems (graph with product conditions) is to use the ratio of adjacent nodes. But note: the product condition is symmetric and the gcd condition adds an extra constraint.\n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n          We have: F(u) * F(v) = g*l for an edge.\n\n          And gcd(F(u), F(v)) = g.\n\n          Then, F(u) = g * a, F(v) = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = (l//g).\n\n          Now, for two edges (u,v) and (v,w):\n\n            For (u,v): F(u) = g1 * a1, F(v) = g1 * b1, with a1*b1 = l1//g1 and gcd(a1,b1)=1.\n            For (v,w): F(v) = g2 * a2, F(w) = g2 * b2, with a2*b2 = l2//g2 and gcd(a2,b2)=1.\n\n          Then, we have: g1 * b1 = g2 * a2.\n\n          So the value of F(v) must be divisible by both g1 and g2? Actually, yes, because F(v) is g1*b1 and also g2*a2.\n\n          Then, the value F(v) must be divisible by lcm(g1, g2). But note: from the first edge, F(v) = g1*b1, and from the second, F(v)=g2*a2.\n\n          Also, the prime factors of F(v) must be the union of the primes in g1 and g2? Not necessarily: if g1 and g2 share primes, then the exponents must be at least the maximum of the exponents in g1 and g2.\n\n        However, we can factorize the numbers and store the exponents for each prime for each node. But that would be too slow.\n\n        There is a simpler way?\n\n        Known fact: In a graph where each edge enforces a multiplicative relation (like u*v = constant) and also a divisibility (gcd condition), we can use the following:\n\n          Let's define for each edge (u, v, g, l) the value of the node must be a divisor of (g*l) and also a multiple of g. But note: the product condition is global for the edge.\n\n        We can use the following algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute for each edge if l % g != 0 -> \"NO\".\n\n          Step 2: We will assign each node a candidate value. We can start by setting all nodes to 1 (or undefined). Then, we can use a BFS/DFS to assign values.\n\n          However, the value for a node is determined by the product of the base from the edge and the cofactor from the other node. But the problem is that the base g is per edge and the same node must satisfy multiple bases.\n\n        Another idea: use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Not directly.\n\n        Insight from the product: \n\n          Consider that the entire graph must satisfy: for each edge (u, v, g, l): F(u) * F(v) = g*l.\n\n          Then, if we fix a root node, we can set F(root) = some value, then for each neighbor, F(neighbor) = (g*l) / F(root) for that edge. But then the same neighbor might get conflicting values from different edges.\n\n        But note: the product condition is for each edge independently. However, if there are multiple paths, the product along a path must be consistent.\n\n        Actually, if we consider the entire connected component, the product condition implies that the product of F(u) for all edges must be consistent in a multiplicative sense. However, the product of F(u)*F(v) for two adjacent nodes is fixed, but the same node appears in multiple edges.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n\n          Let the entire connected component have nodes and edges. Then, we can set:\n\n            F(u) = (some base) * (product of factors from the edges) ?\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          We know that the value for a node must be the same regardless of the path. So if we have two different ways to compute F(u) from the root, they must agree.\n\n        But note: the product condition is multiplicative, so if we fix a root r and set F(r) = x, then for an edge (r, v, g, l): F(v) = (g*l) / x.\n\n        Then for an edge (v, w, g2, l2): F(w) = (g2*l2) / F(v) = (g2*l2 * x) / (g*l)\n\n        But then we have a constraint from the edge (r, w) if it exists? Not necessarily.\n\n        However, if there is a cycle, then we must have that the product of the ratios around the cycle is 1.\n\n        Example: cycle of three edges (r, v, g1, l1), (v, w, g2, l2), (w, r, g3, l3). Then:\n\n          F(r) = x\n          F(v) = (g1*l1) / x\n          F(w) = (g2*l2) / F(v) = (g2*l2 * x) / (g1*l1)\n          Then, from edge (w, r): F(r) * F(w) = (g3*l3) -> x * (g2*l2*x)/(g1*l1) = g3*l3\n          => x^2 = (g1*l1*g3*l3) / (g2*l2)\n\n        Then x must be sqrt( ... ). But x must be an integer.\n\n        Therefore, we can use this to check consistency. However, doing this for every cycle is too heavy.\n\n        We need a better approach.\n\n        Let me try to use the gcd condition to extract the prime factors.\n\n        We know that the entire assignment must have the same set of primes for the entire component? Not necessarily, but the primes that appear in any edge must be considered.\n\n        However, note: the product condition: F(u)*F(v)=g*l, so the primes in g*l must be the union of the primes in F(u) and F(v). But the same prime might appear in multiple edges.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Factorize the product of all g*l for the entire component? But that is too big.\n\n        Another idea: use the fact that the value for a node must be the product of the primes raised to exponents that are at least the maximum gcd exponent in the edges incident to it, and at most the maximum lcm exponent in the edges incident to it.\n\n        But wait: for a given prime p and an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n          Let e_g = exponent of p in g, and e_l = exponent of p in l.\n\n          Then, for the edge, the exponents in F(u) and F(v) must satisfy:\n            min(e_u, e_v) = e_g\n            max(e_u, e_v) = e_l\n\n        Then, for a node u, the exponent for p must be at least the maximum of the gcd exponents (e_g) of all edges incident to u? Actually, no: for an edge (u, v, g, l), the exponent for p in F(u) must be at least e_g (from that edge). But also, for the same prime p, if u appears in multiple edges, then the exponent in u must be at least the maximum e_g over all edges incident to u? And at most the maximum e_l over the edges incident to u? \n\n        Actually, no: the exponent in u for prime p must be at least the maximum e_g (from the edges) and also, the exponent in u for prime p must be such that for each edge (u, v, g, l) with exponent e_g and e_l, we have:\n            exponent_u >= e_g\n            exponent_u <= e_l   (because the LCM is the maximum, so if u has an exponent greater than e_l, then the LCM would be at least exponent_u, which exceeds e_l, unless the other node has a higher exponent, but wait: the LCM is the max, so the max must be exactly e_l. Therefore, the exponent in u for p must be <= e_l and similarly for v. But also, the minimum of u and v is e_g.\n\n        So for an edge (u, v, g, l) and prime p:\n\n            Let e_u = exponent_p(u), e_v = exponent_p(v), e_g = exponent_p(g), e_l = exponent_p(l).\n\n            Then: \n                min(e_u, e_v) = e_g\n                max(e_u, e_v) = e_l\n\n            And for the node u, the exponent e_u must be either e_g or e_l (if the edge is the only one, then we don't know the relation with other edges). But if there are multiple edges incident to u, then the exponent e_u must be set consistently.\n\n        Now, if we consider a node u and two edges (u, v) and (u, w) with two different primes? Actually, the primes are independent.\n\n        Steps for a fixed prime p:\n\n          - Collect all edges that have the prime p (i.e., g or l contains p).\n          - Then, the entire connected component (for the graph) must have the same set of exponents for p? No, but the exponents must be consistent with the edge conditions.\n\n        However, we can process each prime separately. But the total number of distinct primes is up to about 10^6? The numbers are up to 10^6, so the primes are up to 10^6.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For each prime p (that appears in any g or l), we consider the graph of edges that have p (and the nodes that are involved). Then, for each connected component in the graph of edges for prime p, the exponents must be consistent.\n\n        Then, the overall assignment is the product over p of p raised to the exponent we assign for p.\n\n        But note: the gcd and lcm conditions are defined for the entire number, so the exponents for each prime must be set independently.\n\n        Now, for a fixed prime p and an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n            Let e_g = exponent_p(g), e_l = exponent_p(l).\n\n            Then, for the edge, the exponents for u and v must be (e_g, e_l) in some order.\n\n        Then, we can build a graph for prime p: the nodes are the nodes that are incident to an edge containing p, and the edges are the edges (with weight (e_g, e_l)). Then, we need to assign to each node u an exponent f(u) (for p) such that for each edge (u, v) with (e_g, e_l): {f(u), f(v)} = {e_g, e_l}. \n\n        But note: the condition is that the minimum is e_g and the maximum is e_l. So the two exponents must be exactly e_g and e_l.\n\n        Then, for an edge (u, v) and prime p, the two exponents must be e_g and e_l. However, if we have two edges incident to u, then the exponent for u must be consistent.\n\n        Example: two edges (u, v) and (u, w) for the same prime p:\n\n            Edge (u, v): (e1, e2) = (a, b) so {f(u), f(v)} = {a, b}.\n            Edge (u, w): (e3, e4) = (c, d) so {f(u), f(w)} = {c, d}.\n\n        Then, f(u) must be in {a, b} and also in {c, d}. So we require that {a, b} ∩ {c, d} ≠ ∅.\n\n        Then, we can assign f(u) to be the common value, and then set f(v)=b if a was chosen for u, or vice versa.\n\n        But note: the assignment must be done for the entire graph of edges for p. We can use a DFS/BFS for the graph of edges (for prime p) and assign the exponents.\n\n        Steps for prime p:\n\n          - Build a graph for prime p: \n              Nodes: all nodes that appear in an edge (for prime p) and also include all nodes that are forced by the edges? Actually, we only consider the nodes that are in an edge with prime p.\n\n          - For each edge (u, v, g, l) that has prime p, add an undirected edge between u and v with two values: (min_exp, max_exp) = (min(exponent_p(g), exponent_p(l)), max(exponent_p(g), exponent_p(l))) but wait: actually, we know that the minimum must be the exponent in g and the maximum must be the exponent in l. However, note: it is possible that the exponent in g is greater than the exponent in l? No, because g divides l (so for prime p, exponent_p(g) <= exponent_p(l)). So we have: min_exp = exponent_p(g), max_exp = exponent_p(l).\n\n          - Then, we traverse the graph (each connected component for prime p) and assign exponents to the nodes.\n\n          How to assign?\n\n            We can choose an arbitrary node and set its exponent to one of the two values that appear in its incident edges. Then, for each edge, we know the two exponents must be (min_exp, max_exp). So if we set one node to x, then the other must be (min_exp if x==max_exp else max_exp)? \n\n            Actually, the condition is: {x, y} = {min_exp, max_exp}. So if x is set to min_exp, then y must be max_exp, and if x is set to max_exp, then y must be min_exp.\n\n            However, what if an edge has two nodes that are already set and they are not {min_exp, max_exp}? Then we have a conflict.\n\n          Steps for a connected component (for prime p) with several nodes and edges:\n\n            - Let the set of edges for this component be E_p.\n\n            - We'll do a BFS/DFS and assign one of the two allowed values for the prime p to each node.\n\n            - We maintain a dictionary: node -> exponent (for p)\n\n            - For the starting node, we look at all its incident edges and see what are the two values (min_exp, max_exp) for each edge. The starting node must be assigned a value that is in the intersection of the sets {min_exp, max_exp} for all its incident edges.\n\n            - If the intersection is empty, then no solution.\n\n            - Then, we assign the starting node to one of the values (any value from the intersection). Then, we traverse the edges and assign the other node accordingly.\n\n            - When we meet a node that is already visited, we check consistency.\n\n          However, note: an edge (u, v) must have exponents {min_exp, max_exp}. So if we assign u to x, then v must be y, where {x,y}={min_exp, max_exp}. But if we assign u to x and then later we find another edge for u that forces a different assignment, we must check.\n\n        But wait: the graph for prime p is built from the original edges that contain p. And the entire graph for prime p might not be the same as the original graph (only the edges that have p). However, the original graph might have multiple primes, but we are processing one prime at a time.\n\n        Then, after processing all primes, we can combine the exponents for each node: the final number for a node is the product over all primes p: p raised to the exponent we assigned for p.\n\n        But note: what about primes that do not appear in any edge? Then, the exponent for that prime in the node can be arbitrary? Actually, no: because the product condition must hold for each edge. \n\n        However, if a prime p does not appear in any edge, then it cannot appear in any node? Why?\n\n          Consider: if an edge (u, v) has gcd g and lcm l. If a prime p does not divide g nor l, then p cannot divide both F(u) and F(v) (because the gcd is g, so no prime outside g is common). Also, the product F(u)*F(v)=g*l, so if p divides F(u) then p must divide g*l, but g*l does not have p (since p does not divide g nor l) -> contradiction. Therefore, no prime outside the ones appearing in the edges can appear.\n\n        So we only need to consider the primes that appear in at least one edge.\n\n        However, note: the entire graph might not cover all primes, and also, a node might be isolated (no edge incident) then we can assign any value? But wait: if a node is isolated, then there are no constraints. However, the problem says: the map Pasha has contains m roads. The isolated node has no road. Then, the value for the isolated node can be any positive integer? But the problem says the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less than 1 and did not exceed 10^6. However, the problem does not specify the range for the restored mushrooms, but the example outputs use numbers within [1, 10^6] or sometimes the product might be large.\n\n        But note: the product condition: for an edge, F(u)*F(v)=g*l, and g*l<=10^6*10^6=10^12, so the individual numbers could be up to 10^12. However, the problem does not restrict the restored mushrooms to [1,10^6] but the initial were. But the problem says: restore any arrangement.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 10^6.\" meaning that the original numbers were in [1,10^6]. But our restored numbers might be larger? \n\n        But note: the product condition: F(u)*F(v)=g*l, and g and l are at most 10^6, so F(u) and F(v) are divisors of g*l (but not necessarily, because the condition is the product, not that they divide g*l). However, we have F(u) = g * a, F(v)=g * b, and a*b = l//g, so F(u) and F(v) are at most g * (l//g) = l, which is <=10^6. So the restored numbers are at most 10^6.\n\n        Therefore, the entire number for a node is the product over primes of (prime^exponent). But note: the exponent we assign for a prime p for a node u must be one of the two values (min_exp or max_exp) from an edge incident to u, or if u is not incident to any edge with p, then we don't assign p to u? Actually, if a node is not incident to an edge with p, then we don't have to assign p to u? But wait: the product condition for an edge involving p requires that the product F(u)*F(v) has the prime p with exponent equal to the exponent in l (the LCM). Therefore, if an edge involves p, then at least one of u or v must have p with exponent up to the max_exp. But if a node is not incident to an edge with p, then it might still have p? \n\n        However, consider: if an edge (u, v) has prime p, then the product F(u)*F(v) must have p with exponent = max_exp. Therefore, the sum of exponents in u and v must be at least max_exp (actually, the maximum exponent is max_exp). But if a node is not incident to any edge with p, then it doesn't appear in any edge that requires p, so p can be absent. But then, if we have an edge (u, v) and we know u has no p, then v must have p with exponent = max_exp (because the LCM requires exponent = max_exp). But if u is not incident to any edge with p, then there is no edge forcing p on u. However, if u is connected to a node that has p via an edge, then that edge would require u to have p with exponent = min_exp (if the other node has max_exp) or not? Actually, the edge condition is that the minimum exponent is the gcd exponent and the maximum is the LCM exponent. If one node has exponent 0 (meaning absent) and the other has exponent k (>=1), then the minimum is 0 and the maximum is k. But wait: the gcd condition: the gcd must have exponent min(0, k)=0. But the edge's gcd has exponent e_g. So if e_g > 0, then we require that both nodes have at least exponent e_g. Therefore, if an edge has gcd exponent e_g>0, then both nodes must have exponent at least e_g.\n\n        Therefore, for an edge (u, v) with gcd having exponent e_g for p (which is >0), then both u and v must have exponent at least e_g. Then, if a node is not incident to an edge with p, it is possible that it has p? Only if there is an edge incident to it that forces p? \n\n        Actually, we must consider: the graph of edges for prime p includes all edges that have p (either in gcd or in lcm). Then, if a node is incident to an edge that has p, then we must assign an exponent for p to that node.\n\n        But what if a node is not incident to any edge that has p? Then we can assign exponent 0 (absent) for p.\n\n        However, note: if an edge does not have p (i.e., p does not divide g nor l), then the product F(u)*F(v) must not have p? Actually, no: the product condition is F(u)*F(v)=g*l, and if p does not divide g*l, then p cannot divide F(u) or F(v). But wait: if an edge has p not dividing g*l, then p should not appear. But we are processing only the primes that appear in at least one edge (so p does not appear in any edge). Then, for nodes not incident to any edge with p, we can set exponent 0.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Precomputation: factorize all g and l? But we have up to 10^6 edges and numbers up to 10^6. We can precompute the smallest prime factor (spf) for numbers up to 10^6 (or up to 10^12? but we only need to factorize the g and l, which are up to 10^6). \n\n          However, note: we need to factorize g and l for each edge. The total distinct g and l might be up to 10^6, but we have m edges (up to 10^6). We can factorize each g and l once and cache.\n\n          Step 2: For each prime p that appears in at least one edge (i.e., in the factorization of some g or l), build a graph:\n\n            - The nodes: all nodes that are incident to an edge that has p (including edges that have p in g or l). Note: if an edge has p in g, then p must be in both nodes. If p is in l, then at least one node has p.\n\n            - For each edge (u, v, g, l) that has p (i.e., p divides g or p divides l), we extract:\n                  e_g = exponent of p in g, if p divides g, else 0.\n                  e_l = exponent of p in l, if p divides l, else 0.\n\n            But note: if p does not divide g, then the gcd condition requires that the minimum exponent is 0 (if we allow 0) but wait: the gcd condition says the gcd has exponent e_g. However, if e_g=0, then the minimum exponent is 0. But also, if p divides l, then the maximum exponent is e_l.\n\n            Then, the condition for the edge is:\n                min(e_u, e_v) = e_g   (which is either the exponent in g or 0 if p doesn't divide g)\n                max(e_u, e_v) = e_l   (which is the exponent in l)\n\n            However, note: if p does not divide g, then e_g=0, and if p divides l then e_l>=1. But then the condition becomes: min(e_u, e_v)=0 and max(e_u, e_v)=e_l.\n\n            But if p does not divide g, then the gcd does not have p, so at least one of the two numbers must not have p (exponent 0). But the other can have exponent up to e_l.\n\n            However, if p divides l, then the LCM has p, so at least one node has p (exponent at least 1). \n\n            But note: it is possible that p divides l but not g. Then the condition is: one node has 0 and the other has at least 1, and the maximum is e_l.\n\n            However, what if both nodes have p? Then the minimum would be at least 1, but e_g=0 -> contradiction. So one node must have 0 and the other must have between 1 and e_l.\n\n            But note: the condition is: \n                min(e_u",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (node) in a forest graph based on given roads (edges) that specify the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. The solution involves verifying the consistency of these GCD and LCM values across all edges and then constructing a valid assignment of mushroom counts if possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for any edge connecting two nodes, the product of the mushroom counts must equal the product of the GCD and LCM (i.e., \\(x \\times y = \\text{GCD} \\times \\text{LCM}\\)). Additionally, the GCD condition requires that the minimum exponent of each prime factor in the two numbers matches the GCD's exponents, and the maximum exponent matches the LCM's exponents.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: For each edge, we factorize the GCD and LCM to determine the exponents of all primes involved. This helps in building constraints for each node's mushroom count in terms of prime exponents.\n\n3. **Graph Construction for Primes**: For each prime factor found in any edge, construct a graph where nodes are the lawns involved in edges containing that prime. Each edge in this graph enforces that the exponents of the prime in the two connected nodes must be the GCD's exponent and the LCM's exponent (in some order).\n\n4. **Exponent Assignment**: Using BFS or DFS, traverse each connected component of the prime-specific graph. Assign exponents to nodes such that for every edge, the minimum exponent is the GCD's exponent and the maximum is the LCM's exponent. If a conflict arises during this assignment, the solution is impossible.\n\n5. **Combining Results**: After processing all primes, combine the exponents for each node to form the mushroom count by multiplying each prime raised to its assigned exponent. If all edges satisfy the conditions, output \"YES\" along with the counts; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef factorize(n):\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it));

This helps in understanding the prime components of GCD and LCM values.\n2. **Edge Processing**: For each edge, we check if the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, the solution is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Prime-Specific Graphs**: For each prime factor found in any edge, we build a graph where nodes are lawns involved in edges with that prime. Each edge enforces specific exponent constraints.\n4. **BFS for Exponent Assignment**: Using BFS, we traverse each connected component of the prime-specific graph, assigning exponents to nodes such that the GCD and LCM conditions are met for all edges. If a conflict is found, the solution is \"NO\".\n5. **Result Construction**: After processing all primes, the mushroom counts are constructed by combining the exponents of all primes for each node. If all conditions are satisfied, the result is \"YES\" along with the counts; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of the mushroom count assignment by leveraging prime factorization and graph traversal, ensuring correctness and optimality.",
