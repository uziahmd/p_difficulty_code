The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

The number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q.\n\n We note:\n - Total permutations: n! for each.\n\n Since n can be up to 500, we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n Idea:\n Let I(p) be the inversion count of permutation p.\n\n We need to count:\n   Sum_{p, q: p < q lex} [I(p) > I(q)]\n\n Alternatively, we can fix p and then count the number of q that are lexicographically greater than p and have inversion count less than I(p).\n\n However, the total inversion counts range from 0 to n*(n-1)//2, which for n=500 is about 125000, so we cannot use inversion count as a direct index without being too heavy.\n\n Another idea: dynamic programming.\n\n Let F(i, j) be the number of ways to assign the first i positions and having the inversion count j (for one permutation). But then how do we relate two permutations?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider generating two permutations at the same time.\n\n But note: condition 1: p < q lex, condition 2: I(p) > I(q).\n\n We can break down the problem:\n\n Consider building p and q simultaneously. At each step, we choose two numbers (one for p and one for q) but note that they must form two permutations, so we are choosing distinct numbers.\n\n However, the lex order condition: \n   For the first position where p[i] != q[i], we require p[i] < q[i] (because p < q).\n\n Also, the inversion conditions: the entire p has inversion count I(p) and q has inversion count I(q) and I(p) > I(q).\n\n We can use DP with state (i, j, k) meaning: \n   i: number of positions processed (from 0 to n)\n   j: inversion count in p so far\n   k: inversion count in q so far\n\n Then, at position i, we choose two distinct numbers for p_i and q_i (from the remaining numbers). \n\n However, the numbers we choose for p_i and q_i must be consistent with the lex condition.\n\n But note: the lex condition is not independent of the numbers chosen. Actually, at the first position where p and q differ, we have p_i < q_i. However, if at a given prefix, we have p_prefix = q_prefix, then we haven't broken the tie and we can choose any remaining numbers as long as they are the same? Actually, no: because we are building two permutations, and we are going to assign numbers arbitrarily, but we must ensure that the entire p and q are distinct.\n\n Actually, the standard way to build two permutations is to choose two sets of numbers. But we can use DP that goes by the relative order of the numbers.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n We know that the set of numbers for p and q are the same: {1,2,...,n}. We can consider the process of selecting two numbers for the current position from the remaining set, but we must account for the lex order condition.\n\n How about:\n\n Let dp[i][j][k] = number of ways to assign the first i positions such that:\n   - The inversion count for p is j.\n   - The inversion count for q is k.\n   - And the condition that p is lexicographically less than q holds so far? Actually, we don't know until the end. \n\n But wait: the lex condition is global. We cannot check until the entire permutation is built.\n\n However, we can break the lex condition during the process. Actually, the lex condition is determined at the first position i where p_i != q_i. So if we have p_prefix = q_prefix for the first i-1 positions, then at the i-th position, we must have p_i < q_i.\n\n Therefore, we can design the state to include the last point of difference? That would be too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use inclusion-exclusion or separate the condition.\n\n Another idea: instead of building both p and q independently, we can think of building the two permutations by considering the available numbers and the fact that at the first differing position, the condition must hold.\n\n We can use DP that considers the entire set of numbers used and the next available numbers, but that is also too heavy.\n\n Insight: we can use a combinatorial argument.\n\n Consider: we have two permutations p and q. The condition p < q lex is independent of the inversion counts.\n\n We can also note: the inversion count of a permutation is fixed. But the relation between the inversion counts and the lex order is non-trivial.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the inversion count distribution for all permutations (which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of pairs of permutations (p, q) of size n such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the required count without enumerating all possible pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting pairs of permutations where one permutation is lexicographically smaller than the other and has more inversions. The challenge lies in efficiently handling these conditions for large n (up to 500) without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to process the first `i` positions such that:\n   - The inversion count for permutation p is `j`.\n   - The inversion count for permutation q is `k`.\n   - The lex order condition (p < q) holds up to the first `i-1` positions.\n\n3. **Transition**: For each position, we consider two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: The next elements in p and q are the same. This means we continue processing without breaking the lex order.\n   - **Case 2**: The next element in p is different from q. Here, we must ensure p is lexicographically smaller than q by choosing appropriate elements.\n\n4. **Inversion Count Update**: When adding new elements to p and q, we update the inversion counts based on how many smaller elements remain in the unused set.\n\n5. **Final Count**: After processing all positions, the answer is the sum of all valid states where the inversion count of p is greater than that of q.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    mod = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total_inversions = n*(n-1)//2\n    dp = [[[0]*(total_inversions+1) for _ in range(total_inversions+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(total_inversions+1):\n            for k in range(total_inversions+1):\n                if dp[i-1][j][k] == 0:\n                    continue\n                # Case 1: choose the same number for both p_i and q_i\n                # But we cannot choose the same number twice, so skip\n                # Instead, we consider two different numbers for the current position\n                \n                # We'll consider all pairs (a, b) where a is for p and b for q, and a != b.\n                # But note: we need to consider the available numbers.
