They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n (number of lawns) and m (number of roads). Then m lines, each with four numbers: a, b, gcd, lcm (the two lawns connected and the gcd and lcm for the two numbers on those lawns).\n\n We know that for two numbers x and y (on the two lawns), we have:\n   gcd(x, y) = g, lcm(x, y) = l.\n And it is known that: x * y = g^2 * (x/g) * (y/g) = g^2 * (x * y) / g^2? Actually, the relation is:\n   x * y = gcd(x,y) * lcm(x,y)   [But wait: note that gcd(x,y) * lcm(x,y) = x * y, so that holds.]\n\n However, we also have that both x and y must be multiples of g, and they must divide l. Moreover, we can write:\n   Let x = g * a, y = g * b, then we have:\n        lcm(x,y) = g * a * b / gcd(a,b) = l.\n   But note that the gcd(a,b) must be 1 because we factored out the common part g. Actually, that's not necessarily true: \n        In fact, we have: \n            gcd(x,y) = g, and then we write x = g * a, y = g * b, but then gcd(a,b) might not be 1.\n\n However, note the identity: \n        lcm(x,y) * gcd(x,y) = x * y.\n\n So, from the input, we have two numbers: g and l. Then the product of the two numbers (x*y) must be g*l.\n\n Also, the two numbers x and y must be divisors of l (since they are multiples of g and the LCM is l, then x divides l and y divides l).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each edge (a, b, g, l):\n      - Check if g > l. If so, invalid because gcd cannot exceed lcm.\n      - Check that l % g == 0. Otherwise, invalid.\n      - Then, the product of the two numbers is g*l. But note: the two numbers must be multiples of g and their product is g*l.\n\n 2. However, we don't know the two numbers exactly. But we know that they must be of the form:\n        x = g * d1, y = g * d2, where d1 and d2 are divisors of (l // g) and such that gcd(d1, d2) = 1 (if we factor out the gcd, then the remaining factors must be coprime). \n\n    Why? Because if we let d1 = x/g and d2 = y/g, then:\n        gcd(x,y) = g * gcd(d1, d2) = g => gcd(d1,d2)=1.\n        and lcm(x,y) = (g * d1 * d2) / gcd(d1,d2) = g * d1 * d2 = l => d1*d2 = l//g.\n\n    So, we require that d1 and d2 are coprime and their product is l//g.\n\n 3. Therefore, for an edge (a, b, g, l) to be valid, we must have:\n        l % g == 0, and then the number (l//g) must be factorable into two coprime factors (d1, d2) such that d1*d2 = l//g.\n\n    But note: we don't need to factorize every time. We can check that the prime factors of (l//g) do not overlap between the two sides. However, note that the two numbers on the lawn must be consistent across edges.\n\n 4. The problem becomes: assign to each lawn a number (at least 1, at most 10^6) such that for every edge (u, v, g, l):\n        Let x_u and x_v be the numbers on u and v respectively.\n        Then: \n            gcd(x_u, x_v) = g\n            lcm(x_u, x_v) = l\n\n    And note: the entire graph may be disconnected.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can model this as a system of equations on the nodes. However, note that the constraints say that the initial map had numbers between 1 and 10^6, and the graph has up to ? lawns (n) and roads (m). The input says n and m, but doesn't specify bounds, but typically in competitive programming problems, n and m are within reasonable limits (like up to 10^5).\n\n However, note: the numbers on the lawns must be integers and satisfy the conditions for every edge.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Preprocessing: For each edge, check the basic condition (g <= l and l % g == 0). If not, output \"NO\".\n\n 2. Then, for each edge, we can define the two numbers as being of the form: \n        x = g * d1,   y = g * d2, with d1*d2 = l//g and gcd(d1,d2)==1.\n\n    But note: the same lawn may appear in multiple edges, so the value assigned to that lawn must be consistent.\n\n 3. We can think of the following: \n        For each lawn, we want to assign a number x_i. Then for each edge (i,j) with given (g, l), we must have:\n            x_i * x_j = g * l   (from the identity) and also the gcd(x_i, x_j) = g.\n\n    However, note: the identity holds, but also the gcd condition.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can factorize the numbers and use the graph to propagate prime factors? But note that the numbers are bounded by 10^6, but the graph nodes are arbitrary.\n\n Another idea:\n\n    Let x_i be the number on node i. Then for each edge (i, j) with parameters (g, l):\n\n        Let A = g * (some divisor of l//g) and B = g * (the complementary divisor) and they must be coprime.\n\n    But we have multiple edges. We can try to set:\n\n        Let F(i) be the number on node i. Then for edge (i, j): \n            gcd(F(i), F(j)) = g, and F(i)*F(j) = g*l.\n\n    This implies that the ratio F(i)/g and F(j)/g are coprime and their product is (l//g).\n\n 5. We can use union-find or DFS/BFS to traverse the graph and assign values?\n\n    However, note: the graph might be disconnected.\n\n    How about:\n\n        Step 1: Check each edge individually: if l % g != 0, then invalid.\n\n        Step 2: For each edge, we know that the two numbers must be divisors of some fixed product (g*l) and also they must have the same gcd factor.\n\n        But note: the same node must have a fixed value. How to assign?\n\n    Observation:\n\n        Since the product of the two numbers is fixed (g*l) and the gcd is fixed (g), then the two numbers must be g * d and g * (l//g) // d, provided that d divides (l//g) and gcd(d, (l//g)//d) == 1.\n\n        However, there might be multiple ways to choose d for one edge. But the same node might be constrained by multiple edges.\n\n    We can use the following:\n\n        For each node, we will store a candidate value. Initially, we don't know.\n\n        Then, we can try to fix one node arbitrarily (for example, set one node to a particular value) and then propagate.\n\n    But note: the graph may have cycles. We must check consistency.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let’s denote by x_i the number on node i.\n\n        For each edge (i, j, g, l):\n            We have: x_i * x_j = g * l, and gcd(x_i, x_j) = g.\n\n        Then, we can also note that the gcd of all the numbers in the connected component must be divisible by g for every edge? Actually, more: the gcd of the entire component must divide g? Not exactly.\n\n    Another observation:\n\n        From the edge (i, j, g, l), we have that x_i and x_j must be multiples of g. Similarly, if there is another edge (j, k, g', l'), then x_j must be a multiple of g' and also of g.\n\n        Therefore, the entire connected component must have numbers that are multiples of the gcd of all the g's in the edges of the component? Not exactly: the gcd of the two numbers in an edge is the given g, but the overall gcd of the entire component's numbers must be the greatest common divisor that divides every edge's gcd? Actually, no.\n\n    However, consider: if two edges (i,j) and (j,k) share the same node j, then:\n\n        Edge (i,j): gcd(x_i, x_j) = g1, so x_j must be divisible by g1.\n        Edge (j,k): gcd(x_j, x_k) = g2, so x_j must be divisible by g2.\n\n        Therefore, x_j must be divisible by lcm(g1, g2)? Not necessarily the lcm, but the least common multiple of the gcds from the edges incident to j? Actually, the gcd condition does not directly imply that the node must be divisible by the gcd of the edges, but by each individual gcd.\n\n        So, the number on node j must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of all the g's from edges incident to j? \n\n        However, consider: \n            Edge1: (j,k1) with g1, then x_j must be divisible by g1.\n            Edge2: (j,k2) with g2, then x_j must be divisible by g2.\n\n        Then, x_j must be divisible by lcm(g1, g2). \n\n        Similarly, for the entire component, we can define:\n\n            Let G[i] be the LCM of all the g's from edges incident to node i.\n\n        Then, the number x_i must be divisible by G[i].\n\n    Now, for an edge (i,j, g, l):\n\n        Conditions:\n            (1) x_i * x_j = g * l\n            (2) gcd(x_i, x_j) = g\n\n        Also, x_i must be divisible by G[i] and x_j by G[j]. And note that g must divide both x_i and x_j.\n\n    But note: the condition (2) already requires that g divides both x_i and x_j.\n\n    How to assign the values?\n\n        We can set for each node i: x_i = G[i] * k_i, where k_i is an integer.\n\n        Then, for an edge (i, j, g, l):\n\n            Condition (1): (G[i]*k_i) * (G[j]*k_j) = g * l\n            Condition (2): gcd(G[i]*k_i, G[j]*k_j) = g\n\n        But note: G[i] is the LCM of the g's from edges incident to i, and similarly for G[j]. \n\n        However, we can also note that the entire graph structure and the edges' g and l must be consistent.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Build the graph.\n\n        Step 2: For each node, compute the LCM of all g's from its incident edges. (Note: if a node has no edge, then G[i] = 1.)\n\n        Step 3: For each edge (i, j, g, l):\n                Check that g divides l (which we did) and that l//g is a positive integer.\n                Also, we must have that the product (G[i] * G[j]) divides (g * l) (because the product of x_i and x_j is g*l, and x_i and x_j are multiples of G[i] and G[j] respectively). \n\n        Step 4: Then, we can set the value for node i to be G[i] * k_i, but we need to choose k_i such that for every edge (i,j) we have:\n\n                (G[i] * k_i) * (G[j] * k_j) = g * l   ... (1)\n\n                and gcd(G[i]*k_i, G[j]*k_j) = g   ... (2)\n\n        From (1): k_i * k_j = (g * l) / (G[i] * G[j])\n\n        From (2): We require that the gcd of (G[i]*k_i, G[j]*k_j) is g. Note that:\n\n                gcd(G[i]*k_i, G[j]*k_j) = G[i] * G[j] * gcd(k_i / (common_divisor?), ...)   -> Actually, we can factor out the common part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n\n                Let d = gcd(G[i], G[j]). Then, we can write G[i] = d * a, G[j] = d * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n                Then, condition (2) becomes: gcd(d*a*k_i, d*b*k_j) = d * gcd(a*k_i, b*k_j) = d * gcd(a*k_i, b*k_j) = g.\n\n                But note: the original edge condition requires that the gcd of the two numbers is g, and we already have that d divides both, so g must be divisible by d. Actually, from the definition of G[i] and G[j], we have that G[i] and G[j] are built from the g's of edges, and the edge's g must divide both. But note: the edge's g must divide the LCM of the g's of the edges incident to i and j. However, the edge's g is one of the factors used in the LCM for both i and j.\n\n        This approach might get complicated.\n\n    Let's try a different approach:\n\n        We know that the two numbers on the edge must be of the form (g * d, g * (l//g)//d) with d dividing (l//g) and gcd(d, (l//g)//d)==1.\n\n        But note: the same node appears in multiple edges. So the value we assign to a node must be expressible in at least two ways (if the node is in two edges) as:\n\n            x_i = g1 * d1   (from edge1)\n            x_i = g2 * d2   (from edge2)\n\n        However, the d1 and d2 must be chosen such that the prime factors of d1 and d2 are disjoint from the prime factors of the other g's and so on.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n\n        For each edge, we can precompute the two candidate forms for the two endpoints. But note: the same node might have multiple edges and the candidate forms must match.\n\n    Since the constraints on the numbers (up to 10^6) and the graph (n, m up to 10^5) might be large, we need an efficient way.\n\n    Insight:\n\n        We know that for an edge (u, v, g, l):\n            x_u * x_v = g*l\n            and x_u and x_v are multiples of g.\n\n        Then, we can write:\n            x_u = g * a,   x_v = g * b,   with a*b = l//g and gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\n        Now, consider the entire graph. The value of a node must be of the form: base * (product of primes from the edges) but without the gcd parts.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n            Let H[i] be the set of prime factors that are \"additional\" to the base gcd that we will determine. But note that the base gcd for the entire connected component must be the gcd of all the g's in the edges? Actually, no.\n\n        Another known fact: In the entire connected component, the gcd of all the numbers must divide every g from the edges. But actually, the gcd of the entire component might be greater than the individual g's? No, because each edge only requires that the gcd of the two endpoints is at least the given g (but actually exactly the given g). However, the overall gcd of the entire component might be the gcd of all the g's from the edges? \n\n        Actually, consider: if we have two edges (u,v) with g1 and (v,w) with g2, then the gcd(u,w) might be greater than gcd(u,v) and gcd(v,w)? Not necessarily.\n\n        Instead, let's consider the following:\n\n            For each edge (u, v, g, l), the two numbers must be multiples of g, and the product is g*l.\n\n            Then, the value of a node i must be divisible by the LCM of all the g's from the edges incident to i. (Let this be base_i)\n\n        Then, we can set:\n\n            Let x_i = base_i * k_i.\n\n        Then, for an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n            base_u * k_u * base_v * k_v = g * l.\n\n            And the gcd(base_u*k_u, base_v*k_v) = g.\n\n        Now, note that base_u is the LCM of the g's from edges incident to u, and base_v is the LCM of the g's from edges incident to v. The edge's g must divide base_u and base_v (because base_u is built from the g's including this one, and similarly for base_v). \n\n        Then, the equation becomes:\n\n            (base_u * base_v) * k_u * k_v = g * l.\n\n        And the gcd condition: gcd(base_u*k_u, base_v*k_v) = g.\n\n        But note: base_u and base_v are built from the g's, and the edge's g is one of them. In fact, we can define:\n\n            Let d = gcd(base_u, base_v). Then, base_u = d * a, base_v = d * b, with gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n        Then, the product becomes: d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = g * l.\n\n        Also, the gcd condition: \n            gcd(d*a*k_u, d*b*k_v) = d * gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = g.\n\n        Since a and b are coprime, the gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) is gcd(a*k_u, b) * gcd(k_u, something?) — actually, we can use the property that if a and b are coprime, then gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = gcd(a*k_u, b) * gcd(k_u, k_v) is not straightforward.\n\n        Alternatively, we can factor out d. Since base_u and base_v are divisible by d, and the edge's g must be divisible by d (because d divides base_u and base_v, and the edge's g is one of the factors used in base_u and base_v, so d divides g). Let g = d * g0.\n\n        Then, the gcd condition becomes:\n\n            d * gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = d * g0   =>   gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = g0.\n\n        Now, note that a and b are coprime, and d divides g, so g0 = g/d.\n\n        Also, we have:\n\n            d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = g * l   =>   d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = (d * g0) * l   =>   d * a * b * k_u * k_v = g0 * l.\n\n        Then, we can set:\n\n            k_u * k_v = (g0 * l) / (d * a * b)\n\n        But note: d * a * b = base_u * base_v / d = (base_u * base_v) / d.\n\n        Actually, base_u = d * a, base_v = d * b, so base_u * base_v = d^2 * a * b.\n\n        Then, the product condition: base_u * base_v * k_u * k_v = g * l  => d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = g * l.\n\n        And we know g = d * g0, so:\n\n            d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = d * g0 * l   =>   d * a * b * k_u * k_v = g0 * l.\n\n        But note: a * b = (base_u * base_v) / (d^2). \n\n        This is getting messy.\n\n    After reading the problem again, note that the initial map had numbers between 1 and 10^6. We are allowed to restore any arrangement.\n\n    There is a known necessary condition for an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n        Condition 1: l % g == 0, and l >= g.\n        Condition 2: The two numbers (g * d and g * (l//g)//d) must be integers and coprime in the d part.\n\n        Additionally, the entire graph must have a consistent assignment.\n\n    How about we do:\n\n        Step 1: For each edge, check that g <= l and l % g == 0.\n\n        Step 2: Compute for each node the base_i (the LCM of all g's from its incident edges). If a node has no edge, base_i = 1.\n\n        Step 3: For each edge (u, v, g, l), check that base_u divides g*l and base_v divides g*l? Actually, from the product condition, we have that base_u * base_v divides g*l (because x_u and x_v are multiples of base_u and base_v, and their product is g*l). But note: base_u and base_v are built from the g's of the edges, and the edge's g is one of the factors. So base_u is divisible by g (because the edge's g is one of the factors in base_u). Therefore, base_u divides g*l? Not necessarily: base_u might be larger than g, but then base_u divides g*l only if base_u divides g*l.\n\n        Actually, we have: base_u is the LCM of the g's from edges incident to u. For the edge (u,v), g is one of them, so base_u is divisible by g. Then, since g divides g*l, base_u divides g*l if and only if (base_u // g) divides l. Similarly for base_v.\n\n        But note: base_u = LCM_{e incident to u} (g_e). Then, base_u / g is an integer because g divides base_u. Then, base_u divides g*l if and only if (base_u / g) divides l.\n\n        Similarly, base_v divides g*l if and only if (base_v / g) divides l.\n\n        Step 4: Now, we can assign:\n\n            Let x_u = base_u * k_u, x_v = base_v * k_v.\n\n            Then, the product: base_u * base_v * k_u * k_v = g * l.\n\n            => k_u * k_v = (g * l) / (base_u * base_v)\n\n        Since base_u * base_v must divide g*l (from the above condition for the edge), then (g * l) / (base_u * base_v) must be an integer.\n\n        Then, we can set k_u and k_v to be the two factors of (g * l) / (base_u * base_v). But note: we also have the gcd condition.\n\n        Condition: gcd(base_u * k_u, base_v * k_v) = g.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            gcd(base_u * k_u, base_v * k_v) = gcd(base_u, base_v) * gcd( (base_u/gcd(base_u, base_v))*k_u, (base_v/gcd(base_u, base_v))*k_v )   [but this is not standard]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that:\n\n            Let d = gcd(base_u, base_v). Then, base_u = d * a, base_v = d * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n            Then, gcd(base_u * k_u, base_v * k_v) = d * gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v).\n\n            And we require that to be g.\n\n            Since g divides base_u and base_v (because base_u and base_v are built from the g's including this edge's g), then g must be divisible by d.\n\n            Let g = d * g0, then we require:\n\n                d * gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = d * g0   =>   gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = g0.\n\n            Now, note that a and b are coprime (because base_u and base_v are built from the LCM of the g's, and when we factor out d, the remaining parts are coprime). \n\n            Then, the gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) is the product of the common prime factors between a*k_u and b*k_v. But since a and b are coprime, the gcd is the gcd(a*k_u, b) * gcd(k_u, b*k_v) is not straightforward.\n\n        However, note that the product condition gives:\n\n            base_u * base_v * k_u * k_v = g * l   =>   d^2 * a * b * k_u * k_v = d * g0 * l   =>   d * a * b * k_u * k_v = g0 * l.\n\n        And we have k_u * k_v = (g0 * l) / (d * a * b) = (g0 * l) / (base_u * base_v / d) = (g0 * l * d) / (base_u * base_v) = (g0 * l * d) / (d^2 * a * b) = (g0 * l) / (d * a * b)   [same as above]\n\n        But note: base_u * base_v = d^2 * a * b, so k_u * k_v = (g0 * l) / (d * a * b) = (g0 * l) / (base_u * base_v / d) = (g0 * l * d) / (base_u * base_v) = (g0 * l * d) / (d^2 * a * b) = (g0 * l) / (d * a * b)   [same]\n\n        This doesn't simplify easily.\n\n    Given the complexity, we might try a simpler method:\n\n        We know that the two numbers on an edge (u, v, g, l) must be:\n            x_u = g * d1,   x_v = g * d2,   with d1 * d2 = l//g and gcd(d1, d2)=1.\n\n        Then, we can set for node u and node v the value to be g * d1 and g * d2 respectively. But the same node may appear in multiple edges.\n\n        We can use a BFS/DFS to assign the value for each node:\n\n            Start with a node and set its value arbitrarily? But the value must be consistent.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let F(i) be the value for node i.\n\n            For an edge (u, v, g, l): \n                We know that F(u) and F(v) must be of the form: g * d1 and g * d2, with d1*d2 = l//g and gcd(d1,d2)=1.\n\n            Then, we can factorize l//g and find a pair (d1, d2) such that d1*d2 = l//g and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Then, we set F(u) and F(v) accordingly.\n\n        However, if we start with a node, we can set F(u) to one candidate, then for each edge from u, we set the adjacent node v to the candidate value that matches the edge condition.\n\n        Steps for BFS:\n\n            Step 1: Build the graph.\n\n            Step 2: For each node, we don't know the value. We'll keep an array F of length n (or a dictionary) for the value of each node.\n\n            Step 3: Choose a starting node s. For the first edge from s, say (s, t, g, l): \n                    Let p = l // g. Factorize p to find two factors d1 and d2 such that d1*d2=p and gcd(d1,d2)==1. Then set F[s] = g * d1, F[t] = g * d2.\n\n            Step 4: Then, for the next edge from s or from t, we must ensure consistency.\n\n        But note: the same node might be reached by two different paths, and the value must be consistent.\n\n        However, the problem: the edge condition does not uniquely determine the two numbers (unless p is prime). For example, if p = 12, then we could have (d1,d2) = (3,4) or (4,3) or (1,12) or (12,1). But note: the condition gcd(d1,d2)=1 requires that the factors are coprime. So (3,4) works, (1,12) works, (2,6) doesn't because gcd(2,6)=2.\n\n        So, we must choose a factorization of p into two coprime factors. But note: the factorization into coprime factors is unique up to ordering? Actually, we can factor p into its prime factors, and then split the primes arbitrarily between d1 and d2. But the condition is that no prime factor appears in both d1 and d2.\n\n        However, the problem is that the value of a node must be consistent across edges.\n\n        Example: \n            Node u is connected to v and w.\n            Edge (u, v, g1, l1): requires that F[u] = g1 * d1, F[v] = g1 * d2, with d1*d2 = l1//g1 and gcd(d1,d2)=1.\n            Edge (u, w, g2, l2): requires that F[u] = g2 * d3, F[w] = g2 * d4, with d3*d4 = l2//g2 and gcd(d3,d4)=1.\n\n        Then, we must have: F[u] = g1 * d1 = g2 * d3.\n\n        So, g1 * d1 must equal g2 * d3.\n\n        Therefore, the candidate value for u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2 (actually, by the base defined earlier). \n\n        We can set the base for node u as the LCM of g1 and g2, and then d1 and d3 would be adjusted accordingly.\n\n    Revised plan:\n\n        Step 1: For each node, let base[u] = 1 initially. Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l), we update base[u] = lcm(base[u], g) and base[v] = lcm(base[v], g).\n\n        Step 2: For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n                Let p = l // g.\n                Check that base[u] divides g*l and base[v] divides g*l. (Actually, we already know that base[u] is divisible by g, so we need to check that (base[u] // g) divides l, and similarly for base[v].)\n\n                Then, let k = (g * l) // (base[u] * base[v])\n                Then, we require that k is an integer.\n\n                Additionally, the gcd condition: gcd(base[u], base[v]) should be divisible by g? Actually, base[u] is divisible by g and base[v] is divisible by g, so gcd(base[u], base[v]) is divisible by g.\n\n                Then, we can set:\n\n                    F[u] = base[u] * (some factor) and F[v] = base[v] * (the complementary factor) such that the product is g*l and the gcd is g.\n\n                But note: the product condition: base[u] * base[v] * (factor_u) * (factor_v) = g*l.\n\n                => factor_u * factor_v = (g*l) // (base[u] * base[v])\n\n                Then, we can set factor_u and factor_v arbitrarily as long as their product is that constant and the gcd condition holds.\n\n                However, the gcd condition: \n                    gcd(base[u] * factor_u, base[v] * factor_v) = g.\n\n                We can write:\n\n                    Let d = gcd(base[u], base[v])\n                    Then, base[u] = d * a, base[v] = d * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n                    Then, gcd(base[u]*factor_u, base[v]*factor_v) = d * gcd(a*factor_u, b*factor_v)\n\n                    We require: d * gcd(a*factor_u, b*factor_v) = g.\n\n                    Since d divides g (because base[u] and base[v] are divisible by g, and d is the gcd of base[u] and base[v], which are built from the g's, so d divides g), let g = d * g0.\n\n                    Then, we require: gcd(a*factor_u, b*factor_v) = g0.\n\n                    Now, note that a and b are coprime, so the gcd(a*factor_u, b*factor_v) is gcd(factor_u, b) * gcd(a, factor_v) ??? Not exactly.\n\n                    Actually, because a and b are coprime, the gcd(a*factor_u, b*factor_v) is the gcd(factor_u, factor_v) times something? Not necessarily.\n\n                This seems too abstract.\n\n    After further thought, note that the entire system is defined by the edges. We can use the following necessary and sufficient conditions for an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n        (a) l % g == 0.\n        (b) g divides both base[u] and base[v] (which is true by construction).\n        (c) (base[u] * base[v]) divides (g*l) (which ensures that the product condition can be satisfied by integer factors).\n        (d) Additionally, the gcd condition: We require that the gcd of the two final numbers is exactly g.\n\n        But note: the two final numbers are base[u] * k_u and base[v] * k_v, and their product is g*l.\n\n        We can also note that the gcd of the two numbers must be at least g (since both are multiples of g). But we require exactly g.\n\n        Consider: \n            Let x = base[u] * k_u, y = base[v] * k_v.\n            Then, gcd(x,y) = gcd(base[u]*k_u, base[v]*k_v).\n\n            Since base[u] and base[v] are divisible by g, we can write base[u] = g * a, base[v] = g * b, then x = g*a*k_u, y = g*b*k_v, so gcd(x,y) = g * gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v).\n\n            We require that gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = 1.\n\n        Now, what are a and b? a = base[u] // g, b = base[v] // g.\n\n        Then, the product condition: (g*a*k_u) * (g*b*k_v) = g*l  => a * b * k_u * k_v = l // g.\n\n        And we require that gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = 1.\n\n        But note: a and b might not be coprime. In fact, base[u] and base[v] are built from LCM of g's, and they might have common factors beyond g.\n\n        However, we have base[u] = LCM_{incident to u} (g_i). The edge's g is one of them, and possibly others. The value a = base[u] // g is an integer.\n\n        But note: the entire base[u] is the LCM of the g's, and the edge's g is one of them, so a = base[u] // g is the part of base[u] after removing the factor g.\n\n        Now, we have:\n\n            a * b * k_u * k_v = l // g.\n\n        And we require that gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v) = 1.\n\n        This means that a*k_u and b*k_v share no common prime factor.\n\n        But note: a and b might share common prime factors? Actually, base[u] and base[v] are built from the g's, and the edge's g is common. However, the other g's incident to u and v might introduce common factors. \n\n        Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, we can write a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with gcd(a1,b1)=1.\n\n        Then, the product condition: d^2 * a1 * b1 * k_u * k_v = l // g.\n\n        And the gcd condition: gcd(d*a1*k_u, d*b1*k_v) = d * gcd(a1*k_u, b1*k_v) = 1? -> No, we require the gcd to be 1, but here we have a factor d. \n\n        Wait, no: our requirement was gcd(a*k_u, b*k_v)=1. But now a and b have a common factor d, so a*k_u and b*k_v will have at least the factor d in common (unless k_u and k_v cancel it). But k_u and k_v are chosen from the product condition.\n\n        This indicates that the condition (d) is not satisfied if d>1.\n\n        Therefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an edge are:\n\n            (a) l % g",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (vertex) in a graph based on given roads (edges), where each edge provides the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on its connecting lawns.
