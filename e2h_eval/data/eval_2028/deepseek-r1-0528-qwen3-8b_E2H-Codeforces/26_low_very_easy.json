Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n So we have three variables with ranges. The total number of triples without the triangle condition is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1). However, not all satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n We know that for a triangle with sides x<=y<=z, the necessary and sufficient condition is x+y>z.\n\n Since x<=y<=z, we have two other conditions: x+z>y and y+z>x. But note that because z>=y>=x, then x+z>=x+x<=y? Actually, let's check:\n\n Condition 1: x+y>z (because x<=y<=z, then x+z>=y+z>y (if z>y) but wait, actually the condition x+z>y is automatically satisfied because x>=1 and z>=y so x+z>=1+y>y. Similarly, y+z>x is obviously true because y>=x and z>=1 so y+z>=x+1>x.\n\n Therefore, the only condition we need to enforce is x+y>z.\n\n How to count?\n\n We can fix z from C to D, then y from B to C, and x from A to B, but then we require x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over z, then for each z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z.\n\n But note: the ranges can be up to 500000, so we cannot iterate over z and then over y and then over x (which would be O(D-A)*O(C-B)*O(B-A) ~ 5e5 * 5e5 * 5e5 -> too slow).\n\n Instead, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>k for a given k.\n\n Let F(k) = number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>k.\n\n Then the answer would be the sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z) [but note: the condition is x+y>z, so we want F(z)].\n\n However, note: the condition for a fixed z is x+y>z, so we need to count (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can also compute the total pairs and subtract the ones that do not satisfy (i.e., x+y<=z). But note: the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). Then the count for a fixed z is:\n   F(z) = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - G(z)\n where G(z) = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n But note: we have fixed ranges for x and y.\n\n How to compute G(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z?\n\n We can break it down:\n\n For a fixed x (from A to B), the condition on y is: y <= min(C, z-x) and y>=B.\n\n So for fixed x, the valid y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)].\n\n But note: if min(C, z-x) < B, then there are 0 for that x.\n\n So for a fixed x, the count of y is: max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) if min(C, z-x) >= B, otherwise 0.\n\n Then G(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1)   [provided that min(C, z-x) >= B]\n\n Alternatively, we can change the order: iterate by x from A to B, and for each x, the condition on y is y<=min(C, z-x) and y>=B. So the condition for y is: y in [B, min(C, z-x)].\n\n But note: we cannot iterate over x from A to B for each z (because then we do (D-C+1)*(B-A) which is about 500000*500000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight is recognizing that for three sides to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition we need to enforce is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) within specified ranges where \\(x + y > z\\). The ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are given by \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\) respectively.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), we need to count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) in \\([A, B] \\times [B, C]\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This can be rephrased as counting pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\) and subtracting this count from the total possible pairs.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all possible \\(z\\) values and for each \\(z\\) iterating over all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values (which would be too slow for large ranges), we use mathematical formulas to compute the valid pairs efficiently. Specifically, for each \\(z\\), we calculate the number of invalid pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\) and subtract this from the total pairs to get the valid pairs for that \\(z\\).\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**: For a fixed \\(z\\), the number of invalid pairs \\((x, y)\\) is the sum over all \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\) of the number of \\(y\\) in \\([B, \\min(C, z - x)]\\). This sum can be computed using arithmetic series properties to avoid nested loops.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n_x = B - A + 1\n    n_y = C - B + 1\n    \n    total_pairs_xy = n_x * n_y\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_bound = z - B\n        if low_bound < A:\n            count_invalid = 0\n        else:\n            x_min = A\n            x_max = min(B, low_bound)\n            num_x = max(0, x_max - x_min + 1)\n            if num_x == 0:\n                count_invalid = 0\n            else:\n                y_low = B\n                y_high = min(C, z - x_min)\n                if y_high < B:\n                    part1 = 0\n                else:\n                    part1 = (y_high - y_low + 1) * num_x\n                y_low2 = B\n                y_high2 = min(C, z - (x_min + num_x - 1))\n                if y_high2 < y_low2:\n                    part2 = 0\n                else:\n                    part2 = ((y_high2 - y_low2 + 1) * num_x) // 2 if num_x % 2 == 0 else ((y_high2 - y_low2 + 1) * (num_x + 1)) // 2\n                count_invalid = part1 + part2\n        count_valid = total_pairs_xy - count_invalid\n        total_triangles += count_valid\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) without considering the triangle condition is calculated as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).\n3. **Iterating Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), we determine the number of invalid pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\).\n4. **Counting Invalid Pairs**: For each \\(z\\), we find the range of \\(x\\) values such that \\(z - x\\) is at least \\(B\\). For each valid \\(x\\), the corresponding \\(y\\) values must be between \\(B\\) and \\(\\min(C, z - x)\\). The count of invalid pairs is computed using arithmetic series properties to avoid nested loops, ensuring efficiency.\n5. **Valid Triangles Calculation**: The number of valid pairs for each \\(z\\) is the total pairs minus the invalid pairs. Summing these values for all \\(z\\) gives the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid brute-force counting, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
