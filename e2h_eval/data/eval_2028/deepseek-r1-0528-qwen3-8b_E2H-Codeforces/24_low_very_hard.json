She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We start with n tabs, cursor at 'pos', and we want to leave only the segment [l, r].\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor one step left (if there is a tab to the left) or right (if there is a tab to the right).\n     But note: as we close tabs, the boundaries change. However, initially the entire set of tabs is from 1 to n.\n\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (if any) or to the right (if any). After closing, the remaining tabs are from the current left boundary (which was the last unclosed tab) to the current right boundary (similarly).\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each second\" we can do one of these:\n\n   - Move the cursor left: from i to max(i-1, a)   [where a is the current minimum index of an unclosed tab]\n   - Move the cursor right: from i to min(i+1, b)   [where b is the current maximum index]\n\n   - Close all tabs to the left: then the new left boundary becomes the current cursor position (and the right boundary remains the same)\n   - Close all tabs to the right: then the new right boundary becomes the current cursor position.\n\n But note: the goal is to leave only the tabs from l to r. So we must close all tabs < l and all tabs > r.\n\n Observation:\n   We have two sides to close: left (tabs < l) and right (tabs > r). We can do the operations in any order, but note:\n\n   The cursor must be moved appropriately to perform a closing operation on a side.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Case 1: If the entire range [l, r] is already the only open tabs (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n, then no closing is needed? Actually, no: because initially we have [1, n]. But wait: the problem says \"leave only the tabs from l to r\". So if l=1 and r=n, then we don't need to close anything. Similarly, if the current set is [l, r] then we don't need to do anything.\n\n   However, note: the input says \"the cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\", and we have n tabs initially. So the initial state has all tabs from 1 to n.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n   - If the required segment [l, r] is the entire set, then we do nothing (0 seconds).\n\n   Otherwise, we have to close some tabs.\n\n   We can break the problem into two independent parts: closing the left part (tabs < l) and closing the right part (tabs > r). However, the operations might require moving the cursor and we can interleave moves and closes.\n\n   But note: once we close the left part, the left boundary becomes l (because we close everything < l) and similarly for the right. However, the cursor must be at a position that is >= l (for closing the left) and <= r (for closing the right). Also, we are allowed to move the cursor arbitrarily (within the remaining tabs) until we are ready to close one side.\n\n   Let's define:\n     left_work = whether we need to close tabs to the left? -> if l > 1 (i.e., there are tabs < l)\n     right_work = whether we need to close tabs to the right? -> if r < n\n\n   However, even if we don't need to close one side, we might have to move the cursor to the other side.\n\n   Consider:\n\n     Example 1: Input \"6 3 2 4\"\n        n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n        We need to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\n        One way: \n          Step 1: Move cursor from 3 to 2 (1 second). Then close left (closing tab 1) -> now the tabs are [2,6] (but note: the problem says after closing left, the tabs become from the current left boundary (which is 2) to the right boundary (which was initially 6, but we haven't closed the right yet). Now the cursor is at 2, and the boundaries are [2,6].\n          Step 2: Move cursor from 2 to 3 (1 second) and then to 4 (another second, so total 3 seconds so far) and then close the right (closing tabs 5 and 6) -> then we have [2,4]. Total seconds: 1 (move left) + 2 (moves right) + 1 (close right) = 4? But the example output is 5.\n\n        Alternatively, the example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target states of the tabs and determining the most efficient sequence of operations to achieve the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the total time.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range [1, n] is already the segment [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - If the segment [l, r] is entirely to the left of the initial cursor position, only closing the right tabs is necessary.\n   - If the segment [l, r] is entirely to the right of the initial cursor position, only closing the left tabs is necessary.\n   - If the segment spans both sides of the initial cursor position, we need to move the cursor to both ends (if necessary) and perform the closing operations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: No operation needed if `l == 1` and `r == n`.\n   - **Case 2**: Only close left tabs if `r == n` (no right tabs to close).\n   - **Case 3**: Only close right tabs if `l == 1` (no left tabs to close).\n   - **Case 4**: Both left and right tabs need closing. The solution involves moving the cursor to the left end (l) and then to the right end (r), then performing the closing operations. The total time is calculated based on the distance the cursor needs to move and the closing operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if r == n:\n        moves_left = pos - l\n        if moves_left < 0:\n            moves_left = 0\n        total_seconds = moves_left + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if l == 1:\n        moves_right = r - pos\n        if moves_right < 0:\n            moves_right = 0\n        total_seconds = moves_right + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    moves_to_l = pos - l + 1\n    moves_from_l_to_r = r - l + 1\n    total_seconds = moves_to_l + moves_from_l_to_r + 1\n    print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Case 1**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Case 2**: If there are no tabs to the right of [l, r] (i.e., `r == n`), Luba only needs to move the cursor to the leftmost required tab (l) and close all tabs to the left. The time taken is the distance from the initial position to l plus one second for the closing operation.\n3. **Case 3**: If there are no tabs to the left of [l, r] (i.e., `l == 1`), Luba only needs to move the cursor to the rightmost required tab (r) and close all tabs to the right. The time taken is the distance from the initial position to r plus one second for the closing operation.\n4. **Case 4**: If both left and right tabs need closing, Luba must move the cursor to the left end (l), then to the right end (r). The total time includes the movement to l, the movement from l to r, and one second for each closing operation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal number of operations by leveraging simple arithmetic calculations based on the given positions and segment boundaries.",
