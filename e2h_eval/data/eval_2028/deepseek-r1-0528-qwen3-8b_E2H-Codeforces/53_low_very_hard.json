Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a simpler method.\n However, note: we need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and these occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We cannot use the same substring twice in overlapping? But the problem says they can overlap.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"ababa\" -> output 3 because \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2 (overlapping).\n\n Approach:\n We are to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can try from the maximum possible length (which is n-1, because two distinct substrings of length n would require at least two copies and n can't be more than n) down to 0.\n\n However, note: we can also consider building a set for each length and check if any substring of that length appears at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over lengths from 1 to n//2 (because two non-overlapping? Actually, overlapping allowed, so we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L even if the string length is less than 2*L). But note: the two occurrences must be distinct in terms of starting indices (but they can share some letters). \n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Let n = len(s)\n We'll consider lengths from min(n, 50) down to 1? Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is floor(n/2) for non-overlapping? But overlapping is allowed: \n   Example: \"aaaa\" -> the substring \"aa\" appears multiple times, and the maximum length that appears twice is 4? Actually no, because the entire string is \"aaaa\", then the substring of length 4 appears only once. But we can take a substring of length 3: \"aaa\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). So maximum length is 3.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have overlapping, so the condition is: the substring must appear at least twice. The maximum length L must satisfy: there exist two indices i and j (with i < j) such that the substring s[i:i+L] equals s[j:j+L]. And the two occurrences can overlap (so j can be as low as i+1, but then the next occurrence starts at i+1 and we need the substring to match).\n\n However, the two occurrences must be distinct (i.e., different starting indices). \n\n How about this:\n\n We can iterate from length = min(n-1, ...) down to 1, and for each length, check all substrings of that length and see if any substring appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the total number of substrings is O(n^2) and we are doing for each length from 1 to n, so worst-case O(n^3) which is acceptable for n<=100? Actually, the maximum n is 100, so the maximum length we consider is 99, but then the inner loop for each length would iterate over O(n) substrings and then we check duplicates by storing in a set. \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n For a fixed length L, we generate all contiguous substrings of length L and store them in a dictionary (or set) to check duplicates. Then if we find at least one duplicate, then L is the answer (if we iterate from large L to small, then the first duplicate we find is the maximum length).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the string.\n 2. Let n = len(string)\n 3. If n == 0: output 0 (but the problem says non-empty)\n 4. We'll consider lengths from L = min(n, ...) actually from the maximum possible (which is n-1) down to 1.\n\n However, note: the maximum length L for which a substring can appear twice is at most n-1 (for example, two identical adjacent substrings of length n-1). But if we have a substring of length L, then we need at least two starting indices i and j (with j>=i+1) such that the substring of length L starting at i and j are the same.\n\n But note: the two occurrences must not necessarily be consecutive. However, we can break early when we find a duplicate for a given L.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n Let s be the input string.\n\n Option 1: iterate L from n-1 down to 1:\n   seen = {}\n   for start index i from 0 to n-L:\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        if substring in seen: \n            then we found a duplicate for length L -> output L and exit.\n        else:\n            mark substring as seen\n\n But wait, what if the same substring appears again later? We are iterating from the beginning. We must check for duplicates without marking the current one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of each length and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters in a string that appears at least twice. The key observation here is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, which simplifies the problem compared to cases where non-overlapping occurrences are required.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length, starting from the largest possible down to 1, we check if there exists any substring of that length that appears at least twice in the string. The first length for which such a substring is found (when checking from largest to smallest) will be our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach to check for the longest valid substring first. For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings of length `L` and use a dictionary to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return `L` as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each possible substring length from the maximum down to 1. For each length `L`, it processes O(n) substrings, each of length `L`. Given that the string length `n` is up to 100, the total operations are manageable (O(n^2)), making the solution feasible for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen[substr] = True\n            \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Initial Check**: The length of the string `n` is determined. If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), we default to printing 0.\n3. **Iterating Over Lengths**: The algorithm starts checking from the largest possible substring length (`n-1`) down to 1. This ensures that the first valid length found is the longest possible.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: For each length `L`, the algorithm generates all substrings of that length and checks if any substring has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, it prints the current length `L` and exits.\n5. **Handling No Duplicates**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the algorithm prints 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
