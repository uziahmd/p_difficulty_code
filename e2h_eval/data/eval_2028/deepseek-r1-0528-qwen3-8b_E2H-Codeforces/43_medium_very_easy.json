He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, but note that C appends c's and the condition on the number of c's is defined in terms of existing a's and b's).\n 2. The string is built as:\n    - First, A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n    - Then B appends some number of 'b's to the end.\n    - Then C appends some number of 'c's (which must be either equal to the total count of 'a' OR the total count of 'b' at the time C appends; note: the count of 'a' and 'b' at the time C appends is the same as the entire string without the appended 'c's? Actually, when C appends, the string already has the a's and the b's, so the counts of a and b are fixed from A and B.\n\n However, note the process:\n   Original: Only a's (from A) -> then B appends b's -> then C appends c's (and the count of c is either the count of a OR the count of b).\n\n But there's an important constraint: the order must be such that all a's come first, then all b's, then all c's. Because A gives a string of a's, then B appends b's to the end, then C appends c's to the end.\n\n So the string should be non-decreasing in the sense: \n   All 'a's (if any) must appear before any 'b', and all 'b's must appear before any 'c'.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: The string must be split into three parts: \n    - Zero or more 'a's (but at least one because the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b')\n    - Then zero or more 'b's (at least one)\n    - Then zero or more 'c's (could be zero? But wait: the problem says C appends some number, which could be zero? Let's read: \"some number\" usually includes zero? But the problem also says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", so if the string has no 'c' then the count of c is 0. Then we require 0 to be equal to the count of a or the count of b. However, the problem also says \"since both A and B like the characters, they made sure at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", but doesn't mention 'c'. So if the string has no 'c', then the condition for C is: the number of c (0) must be equal to the number of a or the number of b. However, the problem says \"C appends some number\", which might imply at least one? But the problem statement says \"some number\" (which can be zero). However, let's look at the examples.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'aabc' -> Output: YES. This has two a's, one b, and one c. The c count is 1, which equals the number of b (which is 1). Also, the order is correct: a's then b then c.\n\n But what if the string ends with no c? For example, \"aab\" -> then the number of c is 0. Then we require 0 == count('a') or 0 == count('b'). \n   In \"aab\": count('a') = 2, count('b') = 1 -> 0 != 2 and 0 != 1 -> so it would be NO.\n\n However, the problem states that C appends some number of 'c' (which could be zero) but the condition is that the number of c must be equal to the number of a or the number of b. So if the string has no c, then we must have 0 being equal to either the count of a or the count of b. \n\n But note: the problem also says \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c'\". So the original string from A and B is without any c. Then C appends. So the resulting string must have the c's at the end. However, if C appends zero c's, then the string is just the string from A and B. But then the condition: the number of c (0) must be equal to the number of a or the number of b. \n\n But the problem says: \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", so the counts of a and b are at least 1. Then 0 is not equal to either (unless one of them is 0, but they are at least 1). Therefore, if the string has no c, then we must have 0 == count_a or 0 == count_b, but since both are at least 1, it fails. Therefore, the string must have at least one c? Not necessarily: if the string has no c, then the condition fails. So we can have a string without c only if one of the conditions holds (which requires that the count of a or b is 0) but that contradicts the presence of at least one a and one b.\n\n Therefore, the string must have at least one c if the condition is to hold? Not exactly: if the condition is to hold, then the number of c must be either the count of a or the count of b. If the count of a or the count of b is 0, then we can have 0 c's. But our problem guarantees at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the condition for having no c's is that 0 must be the count of a or the count of b, which is impossible because both are at least 1. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? \n\n But wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then the condition fails. So we must have at least one 'c' unless the condition is satisfied by having 0 c's and one of the counts is 0. However, the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, no: because the condition is about the number of c's being equal to the count of a OR the count of b. So if the count of a is 0 or the count of b is 0, then 0 is acceptable. But the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b', so the counts of a and b are at least 1. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c' (because 0 is not allowed). \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and the problem does not specify that the appended number must be positive. But note: the condition says the number of c must be equal to the number of a or the number of b. Since the number of a and b are at least 1, then the number of c must be at least 1 (because 0 is not equal to 1). \n\n But note: the condition does not require the string to have been built with positive c's, but the condition for the c's is that the total number of c's (which is the number appended) must be either the number of a's or the number of b's. Since the number of a's and b's are at least 1, then the number of c's must be at least 1.\n\n However, what if the string has no c? Then the condition fails. Therefore, the string must have at least one c.\n\n But wait: what if the string has c's but the condition is not met? Then we output NO.\n\n However, the problem does not say that the entire string must have the form a's then b's then c's. There is a catch: the process is defined as:\n   A gives a string of a's -> then B appends b's (so the string becomes all a's and then all b's) -> then C appends c's (so then the string becomes a's, then b's, then c's).\n\n Therefore, the string must be in non-decreasing order (each character is <= the next, but actually we have distinct letters: a, then b, then c). So the string must not have any 'b' followed by 'a' or 'c' followed by 'a' or 'b', etc.\n\n So the steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string is composed of three segments: a's (possibly empty, but the problem says at least one a and one b, so the a part must be non-empty and the b part must be non-empty) then b's (non-empty) then c's (possibly empty? but we just argued that the condition requires at least one c because the counts of a and b are positive, so the c part must be non-empty? Actually, the condition says the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. Since the number of a's is at least 1, then if we set the number of c's to the number of a's (which is >=1) then the c part is non-empty. Similarly for the number of b's (>=1). So the string must have at least one c.\n\n 2. So the string must have at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and at least one 'c'. And the order must be: all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n 3. Additionally, the total number of 'c' must be either the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b'.\n\n However, note: when C appends, the counts of a and b are the ones that were originally in the string (from A and B). So the total number of a's and b's do not change during C's appending. Therefore, the condition is on the entire string without the c's? No, the condition is: the number of c's (which is the total c's in the string) must equal the number of a's (total a's) or the number of b's (total b's) in the entire string (including the a's and b's and the c's? Wait, no: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n Note: the string at the moment C appends is the string from A and B (without the c's). Then C appends c's. So the condition uses the counts of a and b from the string that was given to C (i.e., without the c's). \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the entire string that C receives, which is the string from A and B. So the counts of a and b are fixed and do not include the c's. Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string? Or in the string that C received?\n\n But note: the entire string after C appends has the same a's and b's as the string C received. The c's are appended. So the condition is: \n      count_c = n_a_OR_B_string_received   [where n_a and n_b are the counts from the string that C received]\n\n However, the string that C received is the original string (without the c's). How do we know the original string? We know that the string is built as: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So the entire string is the original string (without c) plus the c's. Therefore, the counts of a and b in the entire string are the same as in the string C received.\n\n So we can use the entire string's count for a and b? Yes, because the c's don't change the a and b counts.\n\n Therefore, condition: \n   Let total_a = count of 'a' in S\n   Let total_b = count of 'b' in S\n   Let total_c = count of 'c' in S\n\n Then, we require that either:\n   total_c == total_a   OR   total_c == total_b\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends\" is total_c, and the number of 'a' in the string (that C received) is total_a (same as in the entire string) and similarly for 'b'. So yes, we use the entire string's counts.\n\n However, there is a catch: the problem states that the string must be built in the order: first all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Check the order.\n    Traverse the string and check that the sequence of characters is non-decreasing in the sense: \n        We expect to see only 'a' until we switch to 'b', then only 'b' until we switch to 'c', then only 'c'.\n    We can do:\n        found_b = False\n        found_c = False\n        for each char in S:\n            if char == 'a':\n                # We should not see 'a' after 'b' or 'c'\n                if found_b or found_c:\n                    return \"NO\"\n            elif char == 'b':\n                # We should not see 'b' after 'c'\n                if found_c:\n                    return \"NO\"\n                found_b = True\n            else: # char == 'c'\n                found_c = True\n\n    But note: we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The above will break if we encounter an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c'. However, we can also check the counts: if there's no 'a', no 'b', or no 'c', then it fails.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break the string into contiguous groups.\n\n  Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n  Step 3: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (but note: the condition on the number of c's requires at least one c because the counts of a and b are positive, so the c count must be positive). However, the problem says the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', but does not explicitly say about 'c'. But the process: C appends some c's (which might be zero) but then the condition requires that the count of c is equal to the count of a or b (which are positive). So if the string has no 'c', then the condition fails. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'. \n\n  However, the problem statement says the string given to you (input) is the final string. So we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? \n\n  But wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then the condition fails. So we can say: the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'?\n\n  Actually, the problem does not say that the string must have a 'c'. It says that C appends some number of 'c'. That number might be zero? But then the condition would require that the number of c (0) equals the number of a or the number of b. Since the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', the numbers are at least 1, so 0 != 1. Therefore, if the string has no 'c', it is invalid.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string\" and \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The word \"some\" can sometimes include zero, but the condition then must be satisfied. But as reasoned, if there are no c's then the condition fails because the counts of a and b are at least 1. Therefore, we must have at least one 'c'.\n\n  But wait: what if the condition is satisfied by having 0 c's and one of the counts (a or b) is 0? The problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the counts of a and b are at least 1. Therefore, the condition for 0 c's fails.\n\n  Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n  However, the problem does not guarantee that the input string has at least one 'c'. So if the input string has no 'c', we can immediately say \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the example input may not cover that. Example: \"aab\" -> no c, then we output \"NO\".\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Check the order: \n        We can split the string into three parts: \n          Part1: all consecutive 'a' at the beginning.\n          Part2: then consecutive 'b' (must be present, and after the a's)\n          Part3: then consecutive 'c' (must be present)\n\n        If we find any character that is not in order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c'), then output \"NO\".\n\n  2. Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n  3. Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (But step 1 ensures we have the order, and step 1 also ensures that if we see a 'b' then we don't see an 'a' again, etc. But we need to check that we have at least one of each.)\n\n  4. Check that the total number of 'c' is either the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b'.\n\n  However, note: the condition is defined on the counts from the string that C received. But the string that C received is the string without the c's. The counts of a and b in the string without the c's are the same as in the entire string because the c's don't add any a or b. So we can use the entire string's counts.\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\"? \n      total_a = 3, total_b = 3, total_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 (for a) OR 3==3 (for b) -> YES.\n\n  Another example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> a=4, b=3, c=3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3 -> YES.\n\n  Example: \"aaabccc\" -> a=3, b=1, c=3 -> condition: 3==3 (a) OR 3==1 (b)? -> YES because 3==3.\n\n  Example: \"aabc\" -> a=2, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no, 1==1 -> YES.\n\n  Example: \"bbacc\" -> \n        Check order: \n          The string is \"bbacc\": \n            First two are 'b' -> but we haven't seen any 'a'? Actually, the process requires that A gives a string of a's. Then B appends b's. So the string must start with at least one 'a'. \n        Therefore, we must also check that the string starts with an 'a'? Actually, the problem says A gives a string of a's. So the string must start with 'a'. \n\n  But wait: what if the string has no 'a'? Then it's invalid because the problem states that A gives a string of a's. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a'. \n\n  So we must check that the string starts with an 'a'? Actually, no: the problem says A gives a string of a's, then B appends b's. So the string must have at least one 'a' at the beginning. But note: the string might have no 'a' if A gave nothing? But the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B appends). So the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'.\" -> the number can be zero? The problem also says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\". So if A gives zero a's, then after B appends, there is no a. But then the condition fails because we require at least one a. Therefore, A must have given at least one a. So the string must have at least one a.\n\n  Similarly, B appends some number of b's (which can be zero?) but then the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So if B appends zero b's, then there is no b. Therefore, B must have appended at least one b.\n\n  Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (as established from the condition on the c's). \n\n  So the entire string must have at least one of each.\n\n  Now, let's design the code:\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Check the order and the presence of the letters.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n      # If the string doesn't have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c', then NO.\n      if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # But wait: we must also check the order.\n\n      # We'll traverse and ensure that the string is divided into three contiguous blocks: [a]* [b]* [c]*\n      # We can use:\n      i = 0\n      # Count the consecutive a's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          i += 1\n      # Now, from i to ... we should have only 'b's\n      j = i\n      while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b':\n          j += 1\n      # Then from j to the end should be 'c's\n      k = j\n      while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c':\n          k += 1\n\n      # Now, if k is not the end, then there are other characters -> invalid\n      if k != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Now, we have broken the string into a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n      # But note: we must have at least one a, one b, one c. We already checked that each letter is present, but note: the breaking might have broken the string even if the counts are zero? Actually, we broke by consecutive same letters.\n\n      # However, we already checked that the string contains at least one 'a','b','c'. But note: the breaking might break the string even if the counts are positive, but we require that the a part is non-empty, the b part is non-empty, and the c part is non-empty.\n\n      # Since we checked the entire string has at least one of each, then the breaking must have at least one in each part? \n\n      # But wait: what if the string is \"abc\"? \n          a: 'a' -> i=1, then j=1: we look for 'b' at index1 -> yes, then j=2: then k=2: we look for 'c' -> yes, then k=3 -> done. \n          Then we have a part: \"a\", b part: \"b\", c part: \"c\" -> valid.\n\n      # What if the string is \"aabbcc\"?\n          a part: \"aa\", b part: \"bb\", c part: \"cc\" -> valid.\n\n      # What if the string is \"abac\"? \n          First we take a's: \"a\", then we try to take b's: next is 'b' -> then we take \"b\", then we try to take c's: then we get \"ac\" -> but then we break at the first 'a' in the c part? Actually, our breaking condition for the c part is while the character is 'c'. So we break at the 'a'. Then k becomes 3 (index of the second 'a') and then we check if k==len(s)? No, because len(s)=5 -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n      But wait, the string \"abac\" is not in order because after the b's we have an 'a'. So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  2. Now, we have broken the string and we know the counts of a, b, c.\n\n      total_a = i   (number of a's)\n      total_b = j - i   (number of b's)\n      total_c = len(s) - j   (number of c's)\n\n  3. Condition: total_c must be either total_a or total_b.\n\n  However, note: the condition is defined on the string that C received, which is the string without the c's. The string without the c's is the a's and b's, so the counts of a and b are the same as in the entire string.\n\n  So we check:\n\n      if total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aaabccc\"?\n      total_a = 3, total_b = 1, total_c = 3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n  Example \"aabc\": \n      total_a = 2, total_b = 1, total_c = 1 -> 1==1 (for b) -> YES.\n\n  Example \"bbacc\": \n      The string \"bbacc\" has:\n        a's: we start at the first character 'b' -> so the a part is 0? But we already checked that the string contains at least one 'a'. \n      So our initial check fails because 'a' is in the string? Actually, the string \"bbacc\" has an 'a' at index 3 and 4? \n        Actually, \"bbacc\": \n          indices: 0:'b', 1:'b', 2:'a', 3:'c', 4:'c'\n\n      So the initial check for 'a' passes. But then our breaking:\n\n          i=0: s[0]=='b' -> so the a part is 0 (we didn't take any a's). Then we break the string: \n          Then we are at index0, and we are supposed to have a's first. But there's no a's at the beginning. Then we move to the b part: we take two b's (indices0 and1). Then we try the c part: from index2, we have an 'a' -> so our c part breaking fails (because we expect only c's). Then k becomes 2, and 2 != 5 -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n      This matches the example: \"bbacc\" -> \"NO\".\n\n  However, note: the example input includes \"bbacc\" and the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\"? \n      total_a = 4, total_b = 3, total_c = 3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n  One more edge: what if the string has multiple runs? Actually, the breaking is by contiguous same letters, but the condition requires that the entire string is a's then b's then c's. So if there is an interruption (like an 'a' after a 'b') then we break.\n\n  But note: the problem says the string is built by appending. So the order is fixed.\n\n  However, there is one more issue: what if the string has no b's? Then the breaking for b's will break immediately and then we have an a part and then a c part. But the problem requires at least one b. So we must check that the b part is non-empty.\n\n  Similarly, the a part must be non-empty and the c part must be non-empty (because the condition requires the c count to be positive and the counts of a and b are positive).\n\n  But note: our breaking:\n\n      We break the string into:\n        a part: from index0 to i-1 (all a's)\n        b part: from i to j-1 (all b's)\n        c part: from j to end (all c's)\n\n      We must ensure that:\n        i>0 (a part non-empty) -> but we already checked the string has at least one 'a', so i>0.\n        j-i>0 (b part non-empty) -> but we checked the string has at least one 'b', so j>i.\n        and the c part: we require at least one c? Actually, the condition requires the c count to be positive because the counts of a and b are positive, so the c count must be positive. Therefore, the c part must be non-empty.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the string must have at least one 'c' (because the condition requires the number of c's to be positive). So the c part must be non-empty.\n\n  But wait: the condition does not require the string to have a 'c' if the counts of a and b are zero? But the problem says the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the condition requires the number of c's to be positive.\n\n  Therefore, we must have at least one 'c'. And we already checked the string has at least one 'c'. But our breaking requires that the c part is contiguous at the end. \n\n  However, note: the breaking procedure does not require that the c part is non-empty? Actually, we break until the end of the string. We check that we reached the end. So if the string does not end with c's, then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n      # Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'\n      if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Break the string into three parts\n      i = 0\n      # Skip all a's\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          i += 1\n\n      j = i\n      # Skip all b's\n      while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b':\n          j += 1\n\n      k = j\n      # Skip all c's\n      while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c':\n          k += 1\n\n      # Now, if we did not reach the end, then there is an invalid character or order\n      if k != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Now, the counts:\n      count_a = i\n      count_b = j - i\n      count_c = len(s) - j\n\n      # We already know the string has at least one of each, so the above counts are at least 1 for each.\n\n      if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"a\"? Then we break: \n      i=1 (because we take the 'a'), then j=1 (no b's) then k=1 (no c's). Then k==1, so we pass the order check. Then we check: \n          count_a=1, count_b=0, count_c=0 -> but we already checked that the string has at least one 'b' and one 'c'? No, because we checked the string contains at least one 'a','b','c'. So if the string is \"a\", then the condition 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s fails: \n          'b' not in s -> True, so we print \"NO\".\n\n  Similarly, if the string is \"ab\", then we check: \n      has 'a','b', but missing 'c' -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n  So the code is:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      i = 0\n      while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n          i += 1\n      j = i\n      while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b':\n          j += 1\n      k = j\n      while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c':\n          k += 1\n\n      if k != len(s):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      count_a = i\n      count_b = j - i\n      count_c = len(s) - j\n\n      if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n  Example 1: \"aaabccc\"\n      a's: 3, b's: 1, c's: 3 -> condition: 3==3 -> YES.\n\n  Example 2: \"bbacc\"\n      The string \"bbacc\": \n          Check: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n          Breaking: \n            i=0: s[0]=='b' -> so we don't enter the a loop -> i=0.\n            Then j=0: s[0]=='b' -> enter the b loop: j becomes 1 (s[1]=='b') -> then j=2: s[2]=='a' -> break. Then we have j=2.\n            Then k=2: s[2]=='a' -> not 'c', so we break the c loop and k=2. Then 2 != len(s)=5 -> NO.\n\n  Example 3: \"aabc\"\n      Check: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n      Breaking:\n          i=0: s[0]=='a' -> i becomes 1, then s[1]=='a' -> i becomes 2.\n          j=2: s[2]=='b' -> enter the b loop: j becomes 3 (then check s[3]=='c' -> break).\n          k=3: s[3]=='c' -> enter the c loop: k becomes 4 (end of string).\n          Then counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n  Example 4: \"aaaabbbccc\"\n      counts: a=4, b=3, c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n  Example 5: \"aab\" -> \n      Check: does not have 'c' -> NO.\n\n  Example 6: \"aabbc\" -> \n      counts: a=2, b=2, c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no, 1==2? no -> NO.\n\n  Example 7: \"aabbcc\" -> \n      counts: a=2, b=2, c=2 -> 2==2 (a) or 2==2 (b) -> YES.\n\n  Example 8: \"abc\" -> \n      counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 (a) -> YES.\n\n  Example 9: \"aaccc\" -> \n      This is invalid because the b part is missing. \n      Breaking: \n          a part: \"aa\" -> i=2.\n          Then we look for b's: starting at index2: 'c' -> so j=2 (no b's). Then we look for c's: from index2 to end -> k=5 (end). \n          Then we check: the string has 'a','c' but not 'b'? Actually, we checked the string has 'a','b','c'? \n          The input string is \"aaccc\", so it does not have 'b'. Therefore, the initial check fails: \n            'b' not in s -> True -> print \"NO\".\n\n  But wait: the initial check: \n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n  So \"aaccc\" has 'a' and 'c', but not 'b'. So we output \"NO\" at the beginning.\n\n  Example 10: \"abbccc\" -> \n      a=1, b=2, c=3 -> condition: 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n  Example 11: \"abbccc\" -> but wait, the condition is on the counts from the string that C received. The string that C received is \"abb\" (without the c's). Then C appends 3 c's. The condition requires the number of c's (3) to be equal to the number of a's (1) or the number of b's (2). It is not. So NO.\n\n  Example 12: \"abbccc\" is built as:\n        A gives \"a\", then B gives \"bb\", then C appends 3 c's. But the condition is that the number of c's (3) must be equal to the number of a's (1) OR the number of b's (2). Since 3 != 1 and 3 != 2, it fails.\n\n  Example 13: \"abbccc\" is correctly broken? \n        Order: \n          a: \"a\" -> then b's: \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: first, a string of 'a's is given by A; second, some 'b's are appended by B; third, some 'c's are appended by C, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at the time C appends (which is the same as the entire string since 'c's don't affect the counts of 'a's and 'b's). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Validate Order of Characters**: The string must be in the order where all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Any deviation from this order means the string is invalid.\n3. **Check Count Condition**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This ensures that the appending step by C meets the specified condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    j = i\n    while j < len(s) and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    k = j\n    while k < len(s) and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    if k != len(s):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = i\n    count_b = j - i\n    count_c = len(s) - j\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the string contains all three required characters ('a', 'b', 'c'). If any character is missing, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Order Validation**: The code then verifies that the string follows the sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. It does this by traversing the string and ensuring that once a different character is encountered, no characters of the previous type appear again. If the order is violated, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Count Condition Check**: Finally, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If this condition is satisfied, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the input string adheres to the specified construction process. The solution ensures correctness by validating both the order of characters and their counts, leveraging simple loops and conditional checks.",
