Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with up to 10^5 queries and the total length of replacement strings is at most 10^5.\n The idea: We cannot do naive string replacements (which would be too slow) because the string can be long and each query might replace many digits.\n\n However, note that there are only 10 digits (from '0' to '9'). We can process the queries in reverse order (from last to first) and use dynamic programming or memoization for the transformations.\n\n Observation: Each query replaces a digit d with a string t. But note: later queries might change the meaning of digits that appear in t.\n\n We can think of the transformation as: starting from the initial string, we apply the queries one by one. But doing that naively (by replacing all occurrences of d with t) would be too slow if we do it sequentially.\n\n Alternate approach: Instead, we can process the queries backwards and build up the effect of each query on the digits.\n\n Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') a transformation: \n   Initially, the digit d is just the string \"d\".\n   Then, when we have a query \"e->f\", then every occurrence of the digit e in the current representation should be replaced by f. But note: the query \"e->f\" might come after other transformations, so we need to consider the entire chain.\n\n However, note the problem: the queries are given in the order to be performed. So the first query is applied first, then second, etc.\n\n But if we try to simulate forward, the string might become very long (each replacement might add characters). And the total length of replacement strings is 10^5, but the initial string is up to 10^5 and the number of queries is 10^5, so the string could become extremely long.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid building the actual string.\n\n Alternative Insight: We can use dynamic programming to compute the final value of each digit.\n\n Let F(d) be the string that the digit d becomes after all the queries.\n\n However, the queries are sequential. Consider:\n   Query 1: replace '2' with \"00\"\n   Query 2: replace '3' with empty string\n\n But note: after Query 1, the digit '2' becomes two digits: '0' and '0'. Then if there is a subsequent query that says \"replace '0' with something\", that will affect the two zeros we just inserted.\n\n How to handle? We can process the queries in reverse order and update the meaning of each digit.\n\n Steps:\n   Let's define an array (or dictionary) `mapping` for each digit (from '0' to '9') that stores the final string that this digit becomes after all queries.\n\n   We start from the last query and go backwards to the first. For each digit, we know that without any future queries, it remains itself. Then, when processing a query \"d -> t\", we update:\n\n        mapping[d] = the string t, but then we must account for the fact that in t, the digits themselves have been transformed by the subsequent queries.\n\n   However, wait: the queries are applied in the given order. So the last query is the most recent. Therefore, we want to express the transformation for each digit as:\n\n        Let F_i(d) be the string that the digit d becomes after applying the i-th query and all subsequent ones.\n\n   Then, for a query at step i: \"d_i -> t_i\", we have:\n\n        F_i(d_i) = t_i, but note: the t_i string might contain digits that are also subject to subsequent queries (i.e., queries from i+1 to n). So actually:\n\n        F_i(d_i) = F_{n}(d_i) but wait, no: the query at step i replaces d_i with t_i, and then the subsequent queries (from i+1 to n) are applied. But we are processing backwards, so we can define:\n\n        Let F_i be the transformation after the i-th query (so F_0 is the initial, F_n is the final). Then:\n\n        F_i(d) = F_{i-1}( transformation_i(d) )   [if d is being replaced by transformation_i, then we use the transformation_i and then apply F_{i-1} to each character in the replacement string]\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n        F_i(x) = \n            if x is the digit d that is being replaced in the i-th query, then F_{i-1}(t_i)\n            else F_{i-1}(x)\n\n        But note: the i-th query replaces all occurrences of d with t_i. Then, the transformation F_i is: take the string, replace every occurrence of d with t_i, and then apply F_{i-1} to the entire string? \n\n        However, note: the subsequent queries (i+1 to n) are applied after the i-th. Therefore, the transformation from the state after i to the state after i+1 is: we first do the i-th query (replace d_i by t_i) and then the next query (if any) is applied. But we are processing backwards, so we want to know: what does a digit become at the end?\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let G_i(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after all queries from i to n (inclusive).\n\n        Then, for the last query (i = n): \n            G_n(d) = d if d is not the digit in the last query, and if d is the digit of the last query, then G_n(d) = the replacement string t_n (but then we must note that the replacement string t_n might contain digits that are subject to no further queries, so they remain as is? Actually, no: the last query is the last one, so we don't apply any more queries. So for the last query, we simply set G_n(d) = t_n.\n\n        Then, for the (n-1)-th query, we have to consider: if we are at the (n-1)-th query, then we replace d_{n-1} by t_{n-1}, but then the subsequent queries (from n to n) are applied. But wait, we have already defined G_n for all digits. Then:\n\n            For each digit d (including d_{n-1}):\n                If d is not d_{n-1}, then G_{n-1}(d) = G_n(d)   [because we don't change d, and then we apply the subsequent queries (from n) which we have already computed]\n                If d is d_{n-1}, then we replace d_{n-1} by t_{n-1}. Then, the subsequent queries (from n) are applied to every digit in t_{n-1}. So:\n\n                    G_{n-1}(d_{n-1}) = the string obtained by replacing every character c in t_{n-1} by G_n(c)\n\n        Similarly, for the i-th query (going backwards):\n\n            For each digit d (0 to 9):\n                if d == d_i, then G_i(d) = the string formed by replacing each character c in t_i by G_{i+1}(c)\n                else, G_i(d) = G_{i+1}(d)\n\n        However, note: the queries are given from first to last. So the first query is index 0, the last is index n-1.\n\n        But wait, the problem: the queries are performed in the given order. So the first query is the earliest, and the last query is the latest. Therefore, the transformation after the last query is the most complete.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let G[0..n] be an array of functions (or rather, for each digit, a string) representing the final form of that digit after the queries from that index to the end.\n\n            Steps:\n                Start from the last query (index n-1) and go down to the first (index 0).\n\n                Initialize: For each digit d, let G[n][d] = d (a string of one character). But wait, after the last query, the string has been transformed by the last query. Actually, we need to define:\n\n                Let G[i] be a function from digit (char) to string (the entire transformation from the i-th query to the end for that digit).\n\n                For i = n (after processing all queries), we don't have any query, so each digit d is just the string d.\n\n                But then, for the last query (say the n-1-th query) we have:\n\n                    For each digit d:\n                        if d == d_{n-1}: then G[i][d] = the string t_{n-1} but with each character c replaced by G[i+1][c] (which is just c, because i+1 = n, and at n we haven't done any transformation beyond the last one? Actually, no: we defined G[n] as the base case, which is just the identity (each digit is itself). Then, for the last query, we set:\n\n                            G[n-1][d_{n-1}] = the string obtained by replacing each character c in t_{n-1} by G[n][c] (which is c).\n\n                    But wait, that means the last query is applied as: replace d_{n-1} by t_{n-1} (without any further modification, because there are no queries after the last one). So that matches.\n\n                Then, for the (n-2)-th query:\n\n                    For each digit d:\n                        if d == d_{n-2}: then G[n-2][d] = the string obtained by replacing each character c in t_{n-2} by G[n-1][c] (which now includes the effect of the last query and the one before last)\n                        else: G[n-2][d] = G[n-1][d]\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Let n_queries = n (number of queries)\n\n          Step 1: Read the initial string s and the queries.\n\n          Step 2: Create an array (or list) for G for indices from 0 to n (we'll index from 0 to n, where G[i] is a list of 10 strings for digits 0 to 9, or a dictionary for digits). But since there are only 10 digits, we can represent each G[i] as an array (or tuple) of 10 strings, where the index corresponds to the digit (e.g., digit '0' is index 0, '1' index 1, ...).\n\n          Step 3: Initialize G[n] (the base case, after all queries) as: for each digit d, G[n][d] = d. But note: the base case is the state after processing all queries. Actually, we are going backwards, so we start from the end.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set:\n\n            Let G = [None]*(n+1)   # G[i] is a list of 10 strings (for digits 0 to 9) representing the transformation for that digit from the i-th query to the end.\n\n            Base: for i = n (the state after the last query), we set for each digit d: G[n][int(d)] = d? But wait, we want to map the digit (character) to a string. Actually, we can store for each digit (as char) the string.\n\n            However, we have 10 digits, so we can index by the character.\n\n          Since the total length of replacement strings is limited (<=10^5) and we have at most 10 digits, we can do:\n\n            Let G[i] be a list of 10 strings, where index j corresponds to the digit j (i.e., '0'->0, '1'->1, ... '9'->9).\n\n          But note: our queries are stored as a list of (digit, replacement string). The digit in the query is a char.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            queries = []  # list of tuples (d_char, t_string) for each query\n\n            Precompute G for i from n down to 0.\n\n            Base: G[n] = [str(i) for i in range(10)]   # but wait, this is for digits 0 to 9. Actually, we want for each digit d (from '0' to '9') the string representation is just the digit. But note: the digit is a char, but we are storing the string. So for digit '0', we store \"0\", for '1' we store \"1\", etc.\n\n            Actually, we can store G[i] as an array of 10 strings, and the index j is for the digit str(j). But wait, our queries use characters. We can index by the integer of the digit.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store G[i] as a list of 10 elements, and for a digit represented by char c, we use index = int(c) to get the transformation for that digit.\n\n            Then, for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n                d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n                d_int = int(d_char)\n\n                # For the current query, we are going to update the transformation for d_int.\n\n                # But note: we are going backwards, so we are at the i-th query (which is the i-th from the beginning, but we are processing from the last one to the first). Actually, we stored the queries in the order given.\n\n                # We have G[i+1] (the state after the i-th query and beyond) for all digits.\n\n                # Now, for the current query, we are going to set the transformation for d_char (d_int) to be the string t_str, but with each character c in t_str replaced by G[i+1][int(c)] (if we are using integer indexing) OR by the string G[i+1][int(c)].\n\n                # However, note: the replacement string t_str might contain multiple digits. We need to replace each digit in t_str by its own transformation (from G[i+1]).\n\n                # Then, we set for all other digits, G[i][j] = G[i+1][j] for j != d_int.\n\n                # And for j == d_int, G[i][j] = the new string.\n\n            Then, after processing all queries, we have G[0] which gives the transformation for each digit after all queries.\n\n            Then, the initial string s is processed by: for each char c in s, we replace c by G[0][int(c)].\n\n            Then, we have to compute the number from the resulting string modulo 1000000007.\n\n        But wait: the resulting string might be very long (exponentially long?) but note: the total length of replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, and we are only storing the transformations for the 10 digits. However, the transformation for a digit might be a long string (but the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, and we are doing at most 10^5 queries, but note: the replacement strings are used to build the transformation for the digits, and we are storing the entire string for each digit? \n\n        However, the problem states: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. But note: we are building the transformation for each digit by concatenating the transformations of the digits in the replacement string. This might lead to exponential growth in the length of the string for a digit? \n\n        Example: \n            Query 1: \"2->3\"\n            Query 2: \"3->2\"\n\n        Then, the transformation for digit '2' at step 0 (the first query) becomes the string \"3\", but then at step 1 (second query) we replace '3' by \"2\", so the transformation for '2' becomes \"2\". But wait, let me do the reverse:\n\n            We are processing backwards (from last query to first). \n\n            Let the queries be stored as:\n                queries[0] = ('2','3')\n                queries[1] = ('3','2')\n\n            We start with G[2] (base) = [\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\"] for digits 0 to 9.\n\n            Then for i=1 (the last query, which is the second one): \n                d_char = '3', t_str = '2'\n                Then, G[1][3] = G[2][int('2')] = G[2][2] = \"2\"\n                And for other digits, G[1][j] = G[2][j] for j != 3.\n\n            Then for i=0 (the first query): \n                d_char = '2', t_str = '3'\n                Then, G[0][2] = the string obtained by replacing each char in '3' by G[1][int(c)] -> so for '3': G[1][3] = \"2\". So G[0][2] = \"2\"\n\n            So the transformation for '2' becomes \"2\", and for '3' becomes \"2\".\n\n        Now, if we have a string \"2\", then after both queries, it becomes \"2\". \n\n        But consider: \n            Query 0: \"2->3\"\n            Query 1: \"3->2\"\n\n        Then, if we start with \"2\": \n            After query0: becomes \"3\"\n            After query1: becomes \"2\"\n\n        So the result is \"2\", which matches.\n\n        However, the length of the transformation string for a digit might grow. But note: the problem constraints say that the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is <= 10^5. But our transformation for a digit is built by replacing each digit in the replacement string by the transformation of that digit (from the next state). And the next state's transformation might be a long string.\n\n        But note: the transformation for a digit is independent of the initial string. However, we are storing the entire string for each digit at each step? That would be too memory consuming because we have n+1 steps (up to 10^5) and 10 digits, but the length of each transformation string might be huge.\n\n        Example: \n            Query0: \"1->2\"\n            Query1: \"2->12\"\n\n        Then, processing backwards:\n\n            Base (G[2]): each digit is itself.\n\n            Step1 (query1): \n                d_char='2', t_str='12'\n                G[1][2] = replace '1' by G[2][1] (which is \"1\") and '2' by G[2][2] (which is \"2\") -> so G[1][2] = \"12\"\n                Others unchanged.\n\n            Step0 (query0): \n                d_char='1', t_str='2'\n                G[0][1] = replace '2' by G[1][2] (which is \"12\") -> so G[0][1] = \"12\"\n\n            Now, if we have an initial string containing '1', it becomes \"12\", which is 2 characters.\n\n            Now, if we have a query2: \"1->2\", and then query3: \"2->12\", then we would have:\n\n            Base (G[4]): each digit is itself.\n\n            Step3: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[3][2] = \"12\" (same as above)\n            Step2: d_char='1', t_str='2' -> G[2][1] = replace '2' by G[3][2] = \"12\", so G[2][1] = \"12\"\n            Step1: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[1][2] = replace '1' by G[2][1]=\"12\", and '2' by G[2][2]=\"2\", so G[1][2] = \"12\" + \"2\" = \"122\"\n            Step0: d_char='1', t_str='2' -> G[0][1] = replace '2' by G[1][2]=\"122\", so G[0][1] = \"122\"\n\n            Then, if we have a '1' in the initial string, it becomes \"122\", which is 3 characters.\n\n            Then, if we do another cycle: query4: \"1->2\", query5: \"2->12\", then:\n\n            Step5: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[5][2] = \"12\"\n            Step4: d_char='1', t_str='2' -> G[4][1] = replace '2' by G[5][2]=\"12\", so G[4][1] = \"12\"\n            Step3: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[3][2] = replace '1' by G[4][1]=\"12\", and '2' by G[4][2]=\"2\" (since base state for 2 is \"2\", unless we changed it? Actually, base state is the identity, and then we update from the last query. So for G[4], we updated only digit1. Then for G[3]: \n                G[3][2] = G[4][1] + G[4][2] = \"12\" + \"2\" = \"122\"\n\n            Then, if we have an initial '1' and two cycles, we get \"122\".\n\n            But wait, we started with a '1', then after the first cycle (queries0 and 1) we got \"12\", then after the second cycle (queries2 and 3) we got \"122\", and then after the third cycle (queries4 and 5) we get:\n\n            Step5: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[5][2] = \"12\"\n            Step4: d_char='1', t_str='2' -> G[4][1] = \"12\"\n            Step3: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[3][2] = \"12\" (from 1) becomes \"12\" (from G[4][1]) and then '2' becomes \"2\", so \"122\"\n            Step2: d_char='1', t_str='2' -> G[2][1] = \"122\"\n            Step1: d_char='2', t_str='12' -> G[1][2] = replace '1' by G[2][1]=\"122\", and '2' by G[2][2] (which is \"2\") -> so \"1222\"\n\n            Then, if we have an initial '1' and three cycles, we get \"1222\".\n\n            The length is increasing: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n\n            But note: the total length of the replacement strings is 2 (for query0: \"2\", query1: \"12\", query2: \"2\", query3: \"12\", ...) but the transformation string for digit1 is growing.\n\n            The problem: the transformation for a digit might become very long (exponential in the number of queries that affect it). And we have up to 10^5 queries.\n\n            This is a problem because we cannot store a string of length exponential in 10^5.\n\n        We must avoid storing the entire string. We need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string without building the entire string.\n\n        Let's change our perspective: Instead of storing the entire string for the transformation, we store:\n\n          - The value (mod 1000000007) that the transformation of a digit would contribute if appended to a number.\n          - The length (in terms of power of 10) that the transformation adds.\n\n        Why? Because the final number is computed by:\n\n          number = 0\n          for each character in the resulting string (from left to right):\n              number = (number * 10 + int(char)) % mod\n\n        And the transformation for a digit d is a string T. Then, if we have two digits d1 and d2, the entire string is T1 + T2, and the value is:\n\n          value(T1 + T2) = value(T1) * (10^(len(T2))) + value(T2)\n\n        So, for each digit d, we want to store:\n\n          value[d] = the numeric value of the entire transformation string for d (mod 1000000007)\n          len[d]  = the length of the transformation string (i.e., the number of digits) for d.\n\n        Then, we can combine:\n\n          When we have two transformations: T1 (for digit d1) and T2 (for digit d2), the combined value is:\n\n          value_combined = (value[T1] * (10^(len[T2])) + value[T2]) % mod\n\n        And the total length is len[T1] + len[T2].\n\n        Now, we can update our G[i] for each digit to store (value, length) instead of the entire string.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let mod = 1000000007.\n\n          We need to precompute powers of 10 modulo mod up to a maximum length. But what is the maximum length?\n\n          Note: the total length of replacement strings is 10^5, but the transformations might be built from multiple replacements, so the length might be large. However, note that the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <=10^5. But the transformation for a digit is built from the replacement string and then recursively from the digits in that replacement string. The length might be exponential, but note: the replacement strings are built from digits, and the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n          However, we are storing the length and value for each digit at each step. But we have n steps (10^5) and 10 digits, so we can store for each step and each digit two numbers (value and length). The length might be huge (exponentially large) but we are only storing modulo the value, and the length we can store modulo the exponent for the power? \n\n          Actually, for the value computation, we need the length to compute the power of 10 (which is 10^(length of the next part)). But the length can be huge (like 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, but wait: the total length of replacement strings is 10^5, but the transformation length might be the sum of the lengths of the transformations of the digits in the replacement string. And the same digit might be expanded many times.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <=10^5. But the transformation length is built from the replacement strings and their expansions. The length might be as large as (max_initial_length) * (some factor) but the initial string is 10^5, and each replacement might expand a digit into a string of digits.\n\n          But note: the expansion is recursive. We cannot store the exact length as an integer because the length might be astronomically large (exponential in the number of queries). However, we don't need the exact length, we need the length modulo something? \n\n          Actually, for the value computation, we use:\n\n            value(T1 + T2) = (value(T1) * (10^(len(T2)) mod mod) + value(T2)) mod mod\n\n          But the exponentiation base 10 with exponent = len(T2) mod (something) is not straightforward because mod is 1000000007, and exponentiation modulus requires Euler's theorem? But note: we are working modulo 1000000007, and the exponent might be huge.\n\n          However, we can use modular exponentiation for 10^(L) mod mod, but the length L might be huge (more than 10^18). But note: the problem does not require us to output the entire string, only the number mod 1000000007.\n\n          But the issue is: the length L can be huge (exponential in the number of queries). How to compute 10^L mod mod when L is huge?\n\n          We can use Euler's theorem: since 10 and mod (1000000007) are coprime, we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(mod) (Euler's totient). But note: mod is prime, so phi(mod)=mod-1.\n\n          So, 10^L mod mod = 10^(L mod (mod-1)) mod mod, provided that L >= 0 and we are in the multiplicative group.\n\n          However, is this valid? Yes, by Euler's theorem: a^(phi(mod)) ≡ 1 mod mod, so exponents can be reduced modulo phi(mod) for exponents >=0.\n\n          But note: the length L might be 0, then we don't reduce. Also, we must be cautious: if L is 0, then 10^0=1.\n\n          However, the length L is the total number of digits in the transformation. We are storing for each digit at each step the value (the numeric value mod mod) and the length (the exponent, which we then use to compute the next part).\n\n          But the problem: the length might be huge (exponential). We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it might be too big. But we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation? \n\n          However, wait: the length is used in two ways:\n\n            (1) To compute the power: 10^(len(T2)) mod mod -> we can compute that by pow(10, L2, mod) but L2 might be huge, so we need to reduce L2 modulo (mod-1) because of Euler.\n\n            (2) To combine two transformations: the length of T1+T2 is len(T1)+len(T2). But if we store the length modulo (mod-1) for the exponent, then we lose the true length. However, for the exponentiation we only need the exponent modulo (mod-1). But the true length is needed for the next combination? \n\n          Actually, when combining two transformations, we need the true length to compute the next combination. But the true length might be too big to store.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store the length as a separate value (without mod) but note: the length might be astronomical. \n\n          However, note the constraints: the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion is done recursively. The maximum length we can get is bounded by the total length of the initial string multiplied by the maximum expansion factor per query? But the queries are applied to every occurrence. \n\n          But note: the problem says the initial string s has length up to 10^5, and the total length of ti's is 10^5. The worst-case expansion might be:\n\n            Suppose we have a digit d that is replaced by a string of length L, and that string contains the digit d again. Then, the expansion is recursive. The maximum length for a digit might be exponential in the number of queries that target it.\n\n          However, the number of queries is 10^5, so the maximum length might be 10^5^(10^5) which is way too big to store.\n\n        We must avoid storing the entire length. But note: we don't need the exact length for the entire transformation to compute the value. We only need the value (mod mod) and the length (to compute the power of 10) for combining. However, the length is used to compute the power (via Euler) and also to combine the lengths (for the next transformation). \n\n        But we cannot store the entire length because it's too big.\n\n        Alternative approach: use lazy evaluation for the power and combine the transformations without storing the entire string.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints on the total length of replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion might be heavy. But observe: we are only storing 10 digits per step. The total number of states (steps) is 10^5, so we have 10^5 * 10 = 1e6 states. For each state, we update one digit's transformation based on the replacement string. \n\n        But the replacement string for a query has length at most 10^5, but the total over all queries is 10^5. However, the transformation for a digit is built from the replacement string and the transformations of the digits in that replacement string (from the next state). \n\n        How to update a digit d at step i?\n\n          Let the replacement string for the query at step i (which is the i-th query, but we are processing backwards) is t.\n\n          Then, the transformation for d is the concatenation of the transformations (from the next state) of each character in t.\n\n          So, if t = c1 c2 ... ck, then:\n\n            value[d] = (value[c1_next] * (10^(len[c2_next...ck])) + value[c2_next] * (10^(len[c3_next...ck])) + ... + value[ck_next]\n\n          But wait, that is not linear. Actually, the entire string t is transformed: \n\n            T = t1 t2 ... tk, then the value is:\n\n            value(T) = value(t1) * (10^(len(t2...Tk))) + value(t2) * (10^(len(t3...Tk))) + ... + value(tk)\n\n          And the length is len(t1)+len(t2)+...+len(tk).\n\n        We can compute the value and length for T (the replacement string) by processing each character in t and combining them.\n\n        Steps for updating a digit d at step i:\n\n          Given: the next state (i+1) has for each digit j (0..9) the value[j] and len[j] (both integers, but the length might be huge).\n\n          The replacement string t (a string of digits).\n\n          Then, we need to compute:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            total_len = 0\n\n            For each char c in t (from left to right):\n                digit_index = int(c)\n                total_value = (total_value * pow(10, len[digit_index]_next, mod) + value[digit_index]_next) % mod\n                total_len = (total_len + len[digit_index]_next) % ???   # But wait, the length is not for exponentiation, we need the true length to compute the exponent for the next part.\n\n          However, the length is used for two things:\n\n            (1) To combine the exponents: when we have a transformation T, and we want to combine it with another transformation S, we need to know the length of T to compute the power for S.\n\n            (2) To combine the lengths: the total length is the sum of the lengths of the parts.\n\n          But the problem: the length might be huge (exceeding the range of Python integers? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the length might be exponential and we have 10^5 queries, so the length might have 10^5 digits? Actually, the length is the count of digits, so if we have a transformation that produces 10^k digits, then the length is 10^k, which is a number with k+1 digits. And k might be exponential.\n\n        We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it will be too big (exponential in the number of queries). \n\n        But note: we are using the length only to compute the exponent for the power of 10. And we can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo (mod-1). However, the length is the exponent, and we need the exponent for the next transformation. But the next transformation uses the length to combine, and then we use the length again for the next exponentiation.\n\n        However, we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation, but note: the length is also used to combine the lengths (addition). But addition modulo (mod-1) is not the same as the true length for exponentiation. \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n          When combining two transformations T and S:\n\n            value_combined = (value[T] * (10^(len(S)) + value[S]) % mod\n\n          But if we store the length of T and S modulo (mod-1) (for Euler reduction), then:\n\n            value_combined = (value[T] * (10^(len(S) mod (mod-1)) + value[S]) % mod\n\n          However, the true exponent is the total number of digits in S. But by Euler, 10^(L) mod mod = 10^(L mod (mod-1)) mod mod, provided that L >= 0.\n\n          But the length is also used to compute the next combined transformation. Specifically, the length of T+S is len(T)+len(S). Then, when we use T+S as part of a larger transformation, we need to compute 10^(len(T)+len(S)) mod mod, and we can do:\n\n            10^(len(T)+len(S)) = 10^(len(T)) * 10^(len(S))\n\n          But we can reduce exponents modulo (mod-1) because:\n\n            10^(a+b) mod mod = (10^a mod mod) * (10^b mod mod) mod mod, but also\n\n            10^(a+b) mod mod",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing all occurrences of a specific digit with another string of digits.

Directly processing each query by modifying the string would be computationally infeasible due to the exponential growth in string length.\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing queries in the given order, we reverse the process. For each digit, we maintain two pieces of information after each query:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the transformed digit sequence modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The total number of digits in the transformed sequence (used to compute the power of 10 for combining values).\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: To handle large numbers, we use modular exponentiation. Euler's theorem allows us to reduce large exponents modulo 1000000006 (since 1000000007 is prime), simplifying the computation of powers of 10.\n4. **Reverse Processing**: By processing queries in reverse order, we ensure that each query's transformation accounts for all subsequent transformations, thus correctly building the final value and length for each digit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_euler = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n        \n    if n == 0:\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            num = (num * 10 + int(char)) % mod\n        print(num)\n        return\n\n    next_state_value = [0] * 10\n    next_state_len = [0] * 10\n\n    for digit in range(10):\n        next_state_value[digit] = digit\n        next_state_len[digit] = 1\n\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_digit = int(d_char)\n        new_value = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        if t_str == \"\":\n            next_state_value[d_digit] = 0\n            next_state_len[d_digit] = 0\n            continue\n            \n        for c in t_str:\n            c_digit = int(c)\n            exp_part = pow(10, next_state_len[c_digit], mod_euler)\n            new_value = (new_value * pow(10, next_state_len[c_digit], mod) + next_state_value[c_digit]) % mod\n            new_len = (new_len + next_state_len[c_digit]) % mod_euler\n\n        next_state_value[d_digit] = new_value\n        next_state_len[d_digit] = new_len\n\n    total_value = 0\n    total_len = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d_digit = int(char)\n        if total_len == 0:\n            total_value = next_state_value[d_digit]\n            total_len = next_state_len[d_digit]\n        else:\n            factor = pow(10, total_len, mod)\n            total_value = (total_value * factor + next_state_value[d_digit]) % mod\n            total_len = (total_len + next_state_len[d_digit]) % mod_euler\n\n    print(total_value % mod)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from input.
