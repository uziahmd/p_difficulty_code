Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are dealing with a problem that requires processing up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 characters.\n The catch: each query says \"replace all occurrences of digit d in the current string with string t\", and we have to do them in order.\n\n However, note that the total length of all t's is at most 10^5. But if we do direct replacements naively, the string might blow up (exponentially) and also the number of operations (each query scanning the entire string) would be too slow.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"222\"\n   Query1: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"00000\" (each '2' becomes two zeros)\n   Then if we have another query: \"0->7\" -> then we replace every '0' by '7'. So the entire string becomes \"777\".\n\n But note: the queries are applied sequentially. However, doing each replacement by scanning the whole string and replacing one by one would be too slow because the string can become very long.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We cannot build the entire string if it gets too big (the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, but the intermediate string might be huge). \n\n Observation: We are only dealing with digits from '0' to '9'. There are only 10 digits. And we have up to 10^5 queries, but the queries are given for specific digits.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order, and each query replaces a particular digit with a string (which may contain digits that will be subject to later queries).\n\n Important: We are to compute the number modulo 1000000007, ignoring leading zeros.\n\n Another idea: Instead of building the entire string, we can process the string as a sequence of digits and use dynamic programming or state machines to compute the value and the length.\n\n But note: the replacement rules can change the meaning of digits (because after a replacement, a digit might appear again and be replaced by a subsequent rule). However, the queries are applied in order, so the first query is the first transformation, then the second, etc.\n\n We need to consider that the same digit might be replaced multiple times (by different rules in subsequent queries). But the replacement is done on the entire string at once for a given query.\n\n However, the problem says: Eugene sends queries and we apply them in order. So the first query replaces every occurrence of the digit d1 with t1, then the second query replaces every occurrence of d2 in the new string with t2, and so on.\n\n Since the string can become very large, we cannot store the entire string. Also, the naive way (replacing and building the entire string) is O(n*m) in the worst case and n and m (lengths) can be huge.\n\n Insight: We are only dealing with 10 digits. We can precompute for each digit what its final representation is after all queries? But note: the queries are sequential and the replacement of one digit might introduce other digits that are then replaced by subsequent rules.\n\n However, we can process the queries backwards? \n\n Let me think: \n\n Suppose we have a set of queries. Each query is: d_i -> t_i.\n\n But note: if we do the queries in reverse order, then the later queries (which occur after an earlier replacement) would have already been applied. So we can use dynamic programming (or memoization) to represent the effect of all the queries from a certain point.\n\n Actually, we can process the queries from last to first and update the transformation for each digit.\n\n Let f(d) be the string that the digit d will eventually become after all the remaining queries (from the current one to the last one). Initially, for the last query, the transformation is: for the digit d that is being replaced by the last query, we use the string t_i; for other digits, they remain unchanged until the next (earlier) query.\n\n Then, when processing a query (d_i -> t_i) at an earlier step, we have to update the transformations for all digits that appear in t_i. Because now, the digit d_i is replaced by t_i, but then the digits in t_i (if they appear) are subject to the subsequent queries (which we have already computed).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Start from the last query and go backwards to the first.\n 2. For each digit d (from '0' to '9'), we maintain a mapping (initially identity: each digit maps to itself) that represents what the digit becomes after the remaining queries.\n\n    Let map[d] = the string that digit d becomes after all the queries from this point (including the current one) to the end.\n\n 3. But note: when processing a query (d_i -> t_i) at a backward step, we update:\n    - The current digit d_i: we want to set its transformation to t_i, but then we have to apply the subsequent queries to t_i. However, we are processing backwards and we have already computed the transformation for all digits (for the remaining queries). So we can break t_i into its digits and then for each digit c in t_i, we replace c by map[c] (which is the transformation of c after the remaining queries). Then the entire t_i becomes the concatenation of the transformed versions of each character in t_i.\n\n    However, wait: the transformation for a digit d_i at this step is not just t_i, but t_i with all subsequent replacements applied. So we do:\n\n        map[d_i] = (transform each character in t_i using the current map)\n\n    But note: the current map (at the backward step) is the transformation for the subsequent queries. So we are effectively composing the current query and the subsequent ones.\n\n 4. After processing all queries backwards, we have a transformation for each digit. Then we can process the initial string s: for each digit d in s, we replace d by map[d] (which now is the entire transformation from the beginning to the end). Then we get the final string.\n\n However, there is a catch: the initial string s is processed by the first query, then the second, etc. But if we process backwards, we are effectively defining the transformation for each digit as if we did all the future queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order, so the first query is the first replacement. However, we are going backwards and updating the transformation for the digits that appear in the replacement strings. This is similar to how we handle macro expansion: we expand the replacement string by the subsequent rules.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n   We have two queries: \n        Query1: \"2->00\"\n        Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n   Process backwards:\n\n   Step 1: Start with the last query (query2): \"0->7\". Then we update map for '0': \n        map['0'] = the transformation of '0' under the remaining queries (which is just this one): so we replace '0' by '7'. But wait, the remaining queries (after this one) is none, so we break the string \"7\" (from the query) by each character? Actually, we are updating the transformation for the digit '0' to be the result of applying the subsequent queries to the string \"7\". But there are no subsequent queries, so map['0'] = \"7\".\n\n   Then we process the first query (query1): \"2->00\". Now, we update map['2']: \n        The replacement string is \"00\", and we break it into two digits: '0' and '0'. Then we replace each '0' by map['0'] (which is \"7\"). So the entire replacement for '2' is \"77\".\n\n   Then we process the initial string s = \"222\": each '2' becomes \"77\", so the entire string is \"777\".\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   However, what if the replacement string contains digits that are not the one being queried? For example, if we have a query that replaces digit '1' by \"23\", then we must break \"23\" into two digits and replace each by the subsequent transformations.\n\n   But note: we are processing backwards and we have updated the transformations for all digits that were used in the later queries. So when we update a digit, we use the latest (i.e., the subsequent) transformations for every digit in the replacement string.\n\n 5. However, the problem: the total length of all t_i is <= 10^5, but if we do a transformation for each digit in the replacement string, and we do that for each query, then the total work might be the sum over queries of (length of t_i * (average length of the transformation for each digit in t_i))? \n\n    But note: the transformation for a digit is stored as a string, and we are updating these strings. However, the total length of all replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the expanded transformations might become long.\n\n    But observe: we are storing the transformation for each digit as a string. However, the problem says the total length of the original t_i (the replacement strings in the queries) is <= 10^5. However, the transformations might become longer because we are replacing digits in the replacement string by their own transformations (which might be long). \n\n    However, the problem constraints say the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is <= 10^5. But note: the transformation for a digit might become long, but the queries are processed backwards and we are updating the transformations for each digit. The total length of the transformations might be exponential?\n\n    Let's consider: if we have a query that replaces a digit d by a string containing d again, then we have a recursive replacement. But note: the queries are applied in order, and we are processing backwards, so we update the transformation for d by the expansion of the replacement string (with the subsequent transformations). \n\n    However, the problem says the total length of the replacement strings (the original ti) is <= 10^5. But the transformation for a digit might be built from many such expansions.\n\n    But note: the number of queries is up to 10^5, and each query's replacement string is short (the total is 10^5). However, the expansion of a digit might be long.\n\n    Example: \n        Query1: \"a->aa\" (but we have only digits 0-9) and then \"a->bb\", etc. But we have only 10 digits. \n\n    However, the problem does not specify that the replacement strings cannot contain multiple occurrences of the same digit. And the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n    But note: the queries are applied sequentially. The problem is that the same digit might be replaced by a rule that includes itself (like \"2->22\") and then we have exponential growth.\n\n    However, the constraint is that the total length of the original ti (the replacement strings) is <= 10^5. This does not bound the length of the transformations during the backward processing. \n\n    But wait: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. That is the input. In the backward processing, we are building the transformation for each digit by expanding the replacement string (which is from the input) with the subsequent transformations. However, the expansion might be long.\n\n    However, note: the total length of the original ti is 10^5, but we are processing each query and expanding the replacement string. The expansion of a string of length L by a transformation map (which maps each digit to a string) can be exponential in the worst case.\n\n    Example: \n        Query: \"1->11\", then \"1->11\" again. Then the transformation for '1' becomes \"11\" then \"1111\", then \"11111111\", and so on. After 100 queries, the string would be 2^100, which is too long.\n\n    But note: the queries are specified in the input and the total length of the replacement strings (ti) is bounded by 10^5. However, the expansion of these ti's might be too long to store.\n\n    We cannot store the entire transformed string for each digit because the length might be astronomical.\n\n Alternative approach: Instead of storing the entire transformed string for each digit, we can store the transformation as a function that computes the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (needed for the position of the digits). However, note that the problem asks for the entire number, but we cannot store the entire string.\n\n We can use a DP that for each digit stores:\n   - The numeric value that the digit represents (mod 1000000007) after all the remaining queries.\n   - The length (in terms of the number of digits) that the digit expands to.\n\n Why is the length important? Because when we have a string of digits, the value is computed by:\n\n   value = 0\n   for each digit d in the string (from left to right):\n        value = (value * (10^(len(d))) + val(d)) % mod\n\n But note: the expansion is sequential. However, the entire string is built by replacing each digit by its transformation.\n\n Alternatively, we can process the initial string without building the entire string by using a state machine that computes the value and the length as we go.\n\n However, the problem has 10^5 queries and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion might be too big to store the entire string.\n\n Another idea: use dynamic programming for each digit and store the transformation as a pair (val, len) meaning: if we replace a single digit d, then the resulting part of the string has a numeric value of `val` and contributes `len` digits (so that the power of 10 for the next digit is multiplied by 10^len).\n\n Steps for backward processing with (val, len) for each digit:\n\n   Let dp[d] = (value, length) for the digit d after all the remaining queries.\n\n   Initially, for each digit d, dp[d] = (int(d), 1)\n\n   Then, for each query (from last to first) of the form \"d_i -> t_i\":\n\n        We update dp[d_i] = (0, 0)\n        For each character c in t_i (from left to right):\n            Let (v, l) = dp[c]\n            Then, the value for this part is v, and the length adds up.\n\n            We update:\n                dp[d_i] = (dp[d_i][0] * (10^l) + v) % mod, \n                dp[d_i] = (dp[d_i][1] + l, )   [but wait, we are combining the entire t_i]\n\n        However, note: the entire t_i is replaced by the expansion of t_i. But the expansion of t_i is the concatenation of the expansions of each c in t_i.\n\n        Example: \n            t_i = \"00\", and dp['0'] = (7, 1) [from the example above]. Then the expansion is: \n                First '0' -> (7, 1)\n                Second '0' -> (7, 1)\n\n            Then the entire expansion is: \n                value = 7 * (10^1) + 7 = 77\n                length = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n        But note: the replacement for d_i is the entire expansion of t_i, so we do:\n\n            value = 0\n            length = 0\n            for each char c in t_i:\n                (v, l) = dp[c]\n                value = (value * (10^l) + v) % mod\n                length = (length + l) % (mod-1)?  -> Wait, we don't need the modulus for length? Actually, the length is used for the exponentiation base 10, but the exponent can be huge. However, we cannot store the exponent as an integer because it might be huge.\n\n        But note: the modulus for the value is 1000000007, but the exponentiation base 10: we need to compute 10^(l) mod 1000000007, but l can be very big (exponential). However, the total length of the entire string might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). But note: the problem says the total length of the original replacement strings is <= 10^5, but the expansion can be exponential. \n\n        However, we are storing the length as an integer. The length is the total number of digits. Since the expansion can be exponential, the length might become a number with millions of digits? Actually, the length is the count of digits, so if the length becomes 10^18, we cannot store it as an integer? But the problem says the total length of the original ti is <= 10^5, but the expansion might be huge.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire string, but the value mod 1000000007. We can use the fact that:\n\n            value = ( ... ( (digit0_value * 10^(len1)) + digit1_value) * 10^(len2) + digit2_value) ... ) mod 1000000007\n\n        And we can compute:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each segment (each digit's expansion) in the final string (from left to right):\n                value = (value * (10^(segment_length)) + segment_value) % mod\n\n        But the segment_value and segment_length are stored for each digit.\n\n        However, the segment_length is the total length of the expansion of that digit. The problem is that the expansion of a digit might be very long (like 2^100000) which is impossible to store as an integer.\n\n        Alternative: we store the segment_value and the segment_length, but we cannot store the entire segment_value as a big integer because the value might be huge. However, we are storing modulo 1000000007 for the value, but the length (number of digits) is used to compute the next multiplication: 10^(segment_length) mod 1000000007.\n\n        But note: the segment_length is the total number of digits. The exponentiation base 10 to the power of segment_length mod 1000000007: we can use modular exponentiation. However, the segment_length can be huge (like 10^18 or more) but the modulus is 1000000007, so we can use Euler's theorem? \n\n        However, we cannot compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007 for L up to 10^18 easily? Actually, we can: use pow(10, L, 1000000007). But the problem: the length L is the total number of digits in the expansion. How do we compute L?\n\n        But note: the expansion of a digit is built from the replacement string and the subsequent expansions. The length of the expansion of a digit d is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each digit in the replacement string.\n\n        However, the length might be huge (exponential) and we cannot store it as an integer. \n\n        But note: the problem constraints say the total length of the original replacement strings (ti) is <= 10^5. However, the expansion might be exponential. We need to avoid storing the entire length if it becomes too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use logarithms? But that would lose precision.\n\n        Or we can store the length modulo something? But the exponentiation base 10 requires the exact length? \n\n        Actually, the operation is:\n\n            value = (value * (10^L) + V) % mod\n\n        Here, L is the length of the segment. But if L is huge, we can compute 10^L mod 1000000007 using modular exponentiation (using pow(base, exponent, mod)), but the exponent L might be astronomically large (like 2^100000). However, Euler's theorem tells us that:\n\n            a^phi(mod) ≡ 1 (mod mod)\n\n        So we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007) (which is 1000000006) because 10 and 1000000007 are coprime? Actually, 1000000007 is prime, so phi(1000000007)=1000000006.\n\n        But wait: the length L is the total number of digits. However, the expansion of a digit might be a string of digits that is built by concatenating the expansions of other digits. The length L is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n        However, we are storing the length as an integer. The problem: the length can be huge (exponential). We cannot store the entire integer.\n\n        But note: the modulus for the exponent in 10^L mod 1000000007 is 1000000006 (Euler's totient). So we can store the length modulo 1000000006? \n\n        However, is that valid?\n\n        We have: 10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that L >= 0 and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime.\n\n        But note: the length L is the number of digits, which is a positive integer. However, the expansion might be so long that L is huge. But the problem is: we are building the transformation for each digit, and the length of the transformation is the sum of the lengths of the transformations of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n        We can store the length modulo 1000000006 (the totient) to use in the exponentiation. However, we must be cautious: the value of L is used in two ways:\n\n          (1) To compute the value: we need 10^L mod 1000000007.\n          (2) To compute the length of the entire expansion (for the purpose of the next digits) but wait: the length of the entire expansion is the sum of the lengths of the digits in the replacement string. However, if we store the length modulo 1000000006, then we can only use it for the exponentiation, but the length itself (the actual number of digits) is not used for anything else? \n\n        Actually, in the transformation of a digit, we need two things:\n\n          - The value of the expansion (mod 1000000007).\n          - The length of the expansion (to know the power of 10 to shift the next digits).\n\n        However, the length is used to compute the exponentiation base 10, and we can use modular exponentiation with exponent reduced modulo 1000000006 (because 10 and 1000000007 are coprime). But the length itself is also needed to compute the length of the entire string (which is the sum of the lengths of the expansions). However, the entire string's length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in the initial string. \n\n        But wait, the initial string is fixed, and the transformation for each digit is independent. The total length of the final string is the sum_{d in initial_string} (length of expansion of d). However, we are storing for each digit d the expansion's value and length (modulo 1000000006 for the exponent, but the actual length?).\n\n        However, we cannot store the actual length if it is huge (exponential). But note: the problem says the total length of the original replacement strings is <= 10^5, but the expansion can be exponential. We must avoid storing the actual length as an integer.\n\n        Therefore, we store for each digit:\n\n          dp_val[d] = the value of the expansion of d (mod 1000000007)\n          dp_len[d] = the length of the expansion of d (mod 1000000006)   [for the exponentiation in the next step]\n\n        Then, for a query (d_i -> t_i):\n\n          Let the replacement string t_i be broken into characters c1, c2, ..., ck.\n\n          Then, the value for d_i is computed as:\n\n            value = 0\n            len_total = 0   (this will be the total length, but we are storing modulo 1000000006 for exponentiation, but note: the length is additive, and we are going to use the length for the exponentiation in the next digit)\n\n            Actually, we do:\n\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len = 0   (this is the total length of the expansion, modulo 1000000006)\n\n            for each char c in t_i:\n                v = dp_val[c]\n                l = dp_len[c]   # but note: we are storing the length modulo 1000000006\n\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, l, 1000000007) + v) % 1000000007\n                new_len = (new_len + l) % 1000000006\n\n          Then set dp_val[d_i] = new_val, dp_len[d_i] = new_len.\n\n        However, wait: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. But the exponentiation base 10 uses the length (as exponent) and we use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006. \n\n        But is that correct? \n\n        Consider: We have a segment with length L (actual, not mod) and we want to compute 10^L mod 1000000007. We can do:\n\n            exponent = L % 1000000006   [if L >= 0 and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, which they are]\n\n        Then 10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(exponent) mod 1000000007.\n\n        However, the issue is: the length L is the sum of the lengths of the digits. When we break the replacement string t_i, we are adding the lengths (each length is stored modulo 1000000006). But the actual length is the sum of the actual lengths. \n\n        But we are storing the length modulo 1000000006. Then, when we add two lengths:\n\n            L1 + L2   (mod 1000000006)\n\n        is the same as the sum of the actual lengths modulo 1000000006. \n\n        However, the exponentiation base 10 requires the exponent to be the actual length (the number of digits). But we are storing the length modulo 1000000006. \n\n        The correctness of the exponentiation reduction relies on Euler's theorem, which requires the exponent to be reduced modulo 1000000006 (the totient). \n\n        But note: the exponentiation base 10 and modulus 1000000007 (prime) are coprime, so we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006.\n\n        However, the length we are storing is the total length (the actual number of digits) modulo 1000000006. But the actual length might be huge, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. Then, when we use it in the exponentiation (for the value calculation) we do:\n\n            base = 10\n            exponent = L_actual   (but we don't have it, we have L_mod = L_actual % 1000000006)\n\n            Then, 10^(L_actual) mod 1000000007 = 10^(L_mod) mod 1000000007.\n\n        So we can use the stored (mod 1000000006) length for the exponentiation.\n\n        But wait: the value calculation for the entire expansion of a digit d_i is:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each char c in t_i:\n                value = (value * (10^(len(c)) + val(c)) % mod\n\n            where len(c) is the actual length of the expansion of c.\n\n        However, we are using the stored (mod 1000000006) length for the exponentiation. This is correct because:\n\n            Let L_c = actual length of c, then we need 10^(L_c) mod 1000000007.\n\n            And by Euler, since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, we have 10^(k) mod 1000000007 depends on k mod 1000000006.\n\n        Therefore, we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n        However, there is one more issue: the length is used to compute the length of the expansion of d_i (which is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the characters in t_i). And we are storing the length modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because the length of the expansion of d_i is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the characters in t_i, and we are storing each character's length modulo 1000000006. Then the sum modulo 1000000006 is the same as the total length modulo 1000000006.\n\n        But note: the exponentiation base 10 requires the exponent to be the actual length. However, we are only storing the length modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because of Euler's theorem.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precompute modulus = 1000000007, totient = 1000000006.\n\n          Initialize for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n              dp_val[d] = int(d)   (as integer)\n              dp_len[d] = 1       (mod 1000000006)\n\n          Then, read the queries and process them in reverse order.\n\n          For each query (d_i -> t_i):\n\n              new_val = 0\n              new_len = 0   (will be mod 1000000006)\n\n              For each character c in t_i:\n                  v = dp_val[c]\n                  l = dp_len[c]   (already mod 1000000006)\n\n                  new_val = (new_val * pow(10, l, modulus) + v) % modulus\n                  new_len = (new_len + l) % totient\n\n              Then set:\n                  dp_val[d_i] = new_val\n                  dp_len[d_i] = new_len\n\n          Then, process the initial string s:\n\n              result_val = 0\n              result_len = 0   (we don't actually need the total length for the final number? But wait, the final number is built from the entire string. We need the length for the exponentiation when shifting the digits.)\n\n              Actually, we have to build the entire number. But note: the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in s.\n\n              For each digit d in s:\n                  v = dp_val[d]\n                  l = dp_len[d]   (mod 1000000006)\n\n                  result_val = (result_val * pow(10, l, modulus) + v) % modulus\n\n          Then output result_val.\n\n        But wait: what if the expansion of a digit is empty? Then the length is 0. Then the value would be 0, and the exponentiation would be 10^0=1, so it works.\n\n        Example: the query \"3->\" (empty string) means that the digit '3' becomes empty. Then the value is 0 and the length is 0.\n\n        Then, if the initial string has a '3', then we do:\n\n            result_val = (result_val * 1 + 0) % mod   -> so it removes the digit.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, consider the following: the initial string might have digits that are not queried? Then we use the initial transformation (identity). \n\n        Example: \n            s = \"12\", queries = [ \"1->0\" ]\n\n            Then for digit '1': dp_val['1'] becomes 0, dp_len['1'] becomes 1 (because the replacement string \"0\" has length 1, and the expansion of '0' is (0,1) initially? \n\n            Actually, wait: we start with the identity for each digit: \n                dp_val[d] = int(d), dp_len[d]=1.\n\n            Then process the query \"1->0\": \n                t_i = \"0\"\n                new_val = (0 * (10^1) + dp_val['0']) % mod = (0 + 0) % mod? No: wait, dp_val['0'] is 0 (because we haven't updated it) but initially we set dp_val['0'] = 0.\n\n            Correction: initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'), we set dp_val[d] = int(d). So for '0', we set to 0.\n\n            Then the query: d_i='1', t_i=\"0\": \n                new_val = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n                new_len = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n            Then for the initial string \"12\": \n                first digit '1': becomes (0,1)\n                second digit '2': remains (2,1)\n\n            Then result_val = 0 * (10^1) + 2 = 2.\n\n            But the expected result is: \n                Replace '1' by '0', so the string becomes \"02\", and the number is 02 which is 2.\n\n            So that's correct.\n\n        However, what if there are multiple queries? \n\n        Example: \n            s = \"12\", queries = [ \"1->0\", \"0->2\" ]\n\n            Process backwards:\n\n            First, the last query: \"0->2\"\n                dp_val['0'] = 2, dp_len['0'] = 1   [because the replacement string \"2\" has one digit, and the expansion of '2' is (2,1) initially? Actually, we update the digit '0' to the expansion of the string \"2\". \n\n                But wait, we process backwards: the last query is \"0->2\", so we update dp_val['0'] and dp_len['0']:\n\n                    new_val = 0\n                    for each char in \"2\": \n                        c='2': v = dp_val['2'] (initially 2), l=1\n                        new_val = (0 * 10^1 + 2) % mod = 2\n                        new_len = 0+1 = 1\n\n                Then set dp_val['0'] = 2, dp_len['0']=1.\n\n            Then the first query: \"1->0\"\n                t_i = \"0\", so we break it into one char '0'\n                dp_val['0'] is now 2, dp_len['0']=1.\n\n                new_val = (0 * 10^1 + 2) % mod = 2\n                new_len = 0+1 = 1\n\n                Then set dp_val['1'] = 2, dp_len['1']=1.\n\n            Then the initial string \"12\": \n                first digit '1': (2,1)\n                second digit '2': (2,1)\n\n                result_val = (0 * 10^1 + 2) % mod = 2\n                then * 10^1 + 2 = (2 * 10 + 2) % mod = 22.\n\n            But the expected: \n                First query: replace '1' by '0' -> \"02\"\n                Then second query: replace '0' by '2' -> \"22\", which is 22.\n\n            So that's correct.\n\n        However, note: the replacement in the first query is \"1->0\", and then the second query is \"0->2\". But the second query is applied to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing all occurrences of a specific digit with another string of digits. The goal is to compute the resulting number after all transformations and find its remainder when divided by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, leveraging modular arithmetic and dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all instances of a digit with a specified string. The key observation is that each transformation must be applied sequentially, and the replacements can cascade (i.e., the new strings introduced by one query might be subject to subsequent queries). Directly manipulating the string for each query is infeasible due to potential exponential growth in string length.\n\n2. **Insight**: Instead of processing the string directly, we can model each digit's transformation as a pair: its final numeric value (mod 1000000007) and the length of its expanded form (mod 1000000006, using Euler's theorem for efficient exponentiation). This allows us to handle each query by updating these pairs for the affected digit, considering the transformations of any digits present in the replacement string.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process the queries in reverse order. For each query, we update the transformation of the specified digit by combining the transformations of each character in its replacement string. This ensures that all subsequent queries are accounted for in the transformation. The initial string is then processed digit by digit, using their final transformations to compute the result incrementally.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order, and for each query, it processes each character in the replacement string. The total operations are linear with respect to the sum of the lengths of all replacement strings, which is bounded by 10^5 according to the problem constraints. The use of modular exponentiation ensures that operations remain efficient even with large numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod_val = 1000000007\nphi_mod = 1000000006\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d, t_str))\n    \n    dp_val = {}\n    dp_len = {}\n    for digit in '0123456789':\n        dp_val[digit] = int(digit)\n        dp_len[digit] = 1\n    \n    queries_reversed = list(reversed(queries))\n    \n    for d_i, t_i in queries_reversed:\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for char in t_i:\n            v = dp_val[char]\n            l_val = dp_len[char]\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, l_val, mod_val) + v) % mod_val\n            new_len = (new_len + l_val) % phi_mod\n        \n        dp_val[d_i] = new_val\n        dp_len[d_i] = new_len\n    \n    result_val = 0\n    for char in s:\n        v = dp_val[char]\n        l_val = dp_len[char]\n        result_val = (result_val * pow(10, l_val, mod_val) + v) % mod_val\n    \n    print(result_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input string and queries, initializing dictionaries `dp_val` and `dp_len` to store each digit's final value and length after all transformations.\n2. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: By processing queries in reverse, each query's transformation accounts for all subsequent transformations.
