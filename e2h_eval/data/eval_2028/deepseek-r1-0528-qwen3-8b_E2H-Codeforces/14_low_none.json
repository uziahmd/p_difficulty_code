He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n We are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. But note: it doesn't increase by one every time. \n For example, when n goes from 24 to 25, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\n So, we cannot simply invert the function for each m.\n\n Observation:\n   The problem asks for the number of positive integers n with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n   But note: the same m might be achieved by consecutive numbers? Actually, no: because once we pass a multiple of 5, \n   the zeros increase. And then they stay the same until the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) which causes a jump.\n\n   However, note that the zeros only change at multiples of 5. So between two consecutive jumps (at multiples of 5) the number of zeros remains constant.\n\n   But wait: actually, the value of f(n) is constant for n in [a, b] and then jumps at the next multiple of 5 (or higher power). \n\n   Therefore, for a fixed m, the set of n such that f(n)=m is a contiguous interval? Not necessarily, because sometimes the function jumps by more than one.\n\n   Example: m=5. We know that:\n      f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so m=5 is never achieved.\n\n   In fact, the problem says: \n        Input: 1 -> Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n   Why? Because:\n        f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n   So for m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   But what if m is not achieved? Then we output 0.\n\n   So the problem is: \n        Find all n such that f(n)=m.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Find the smallest n0 such that f(n0) >= m (actually, we want the smallest n0 where f(n0) = m, but note: we might skip some m)\n\n   2. Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (i.e., the lower bound for the m zeros)\n        Let U(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the n's that have exactly m zeros are in the interval [L(m), U(m)-1].\n\n        But wait: is that always true? \n\n        Example: m=1.\n            We want the smallest n such that f(n)>=1 -> that's 5.\n            Then the smallest n such that f(n)>=2 -> that's 10.\n\n            Then the numbers are from 5 to 9.\n\n        However, what if m is not achieved? Then L(m) would be the smallest n with at least m zeros, but then we require that the zeros are exactly m, so if the zeros jump from less than m to more than m, then we don't have any n.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n            Let L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n            Let R(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then the condition for having exactly m zeros is that n is in [L(m), R(m)-1] and also we must have that f(L(m)) == m.\n\n        But note: if m is skipped, then we might have f(L(m)) > m. In that case, there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n        How to compute L(m)? We can use binary search.\n\n   However, note: the input m can be up to 100000. And the n we are looking for can be very large (because m can be 100000, then n is about 4*m, since each 5 contributes one zero, but then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is effectively governed by the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds, inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound.\n\n3. **Checking Validity of \\( m \\)**: After determining the bounds, we check if the lower bound \\( n \\) indeed has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, it means \\( m \\) is skipped (i.e., no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition), and we return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    def binary_search_lower(m):\n        low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 10)  # Start with a sufficiently high upper bound\n        ans = high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if zeros >= m:\n                ans = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return ans\n\n    def binary_search_upper(m):\n        low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 10)\n        ans = high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if zeros >= m + 1:\n                ans = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return ans\n\n    lower_bound = binary_search_lower(m)\n    upper_bound = binary_search_upper(m)\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower_bound) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower_bound, upper_bound))\n    k = len(numbers)\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which contains a single integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeroes**: The function `count_trailing_zeros` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5.\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Two binary search functions, `binary_search_lower` and `binary_search_upper`, find the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes are at least \\( m \\) and \\( m+1 \\), respectively.\n4. **Validation**: After finding the bounds, the solution checks if the lower bound indeed gives exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it lists all integers from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound.\n5. **Output**: The number of valid integers \\( k \\) is printed first, followed by the integers themselves in increasing order if \\( k \\) is positive.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.",
