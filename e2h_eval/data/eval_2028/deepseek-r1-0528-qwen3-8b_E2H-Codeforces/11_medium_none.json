A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend's toast)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend's toast)\n\n However, note that the problem states:\n   Each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt for a toast.\n\n But note: the toast is made by each friend. So for one toast (by one friend) we need:\n   - nl milliliters of the drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n Since there are n friends, and they all must make the same number of toasts, say t, then for one toast (by one friend) the requirements are as above.\n\n Therefore, the total requirements for t toasts per friend (so t * n toasts in total) are:\n   - Drink: t * n * nl milliliters\n   - Lime slices: t * n * 1 slices\n   - Salt: t * n * np grams\n\n But note: the drink is available from k bottles of l milliliters -> total_drink = k * l\n           the lime slices are available from c limes, each cut into d slices -> total_slices = c * d\n           the salt is available as p grams.\n\n So the constraints are:\n   t * n * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   t * n <= c * d        => t <= (c * d) / n\n   t * n * np <= p       => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend\" makes t toasts, so the total toasts is n*t.\n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n   Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml. For 3 friends toasting t times: 3*t*3 = 9t ml. 9t <= 20 -> t <= 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so t can be at most 2 (since we take integer toasts? but the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", and the answer is an integer).\n\n   Limes: 10*8 = 80 slices. For 3 friends and t toasts: 3*t <= 80 -> t <= 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> so t<=26 (but drink limits to 2)\n   Salt: 100 grams. For 3 friends and t toasts: 3*t*1 = 3t <= 100 -> t <= 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> so t<=33.\n\n   Then the limiting factor is the drink: 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 -> floor(20/9) is 2. But note: the example says 2.\n\n However, the example does: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. But wait, how did they get 6 from drink?\n   They said: 20 ml / 3 friends = 20/3 toasts? But wait, the requirement per toast is nl (which is 3) for one friend? Actually, let me re-read:\n\n   \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\"\n\n   So for one toast, one friend uses nl ml. Then for n friends making t toasts each, the total drink used is n * t * nl.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: How many toasts can be made from the drink? \n        total_drink = 20 ml, and each toast (regardless of which friend) requires nl ml? Actually, note: the toast is defined per friend. But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for a toast\".\n\n   However, note: the example calculation: \n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if we consider that each toast is for one friend? But wait, if one friend has a toast, they use nl ml. But if we have multiple friends, then each toast by any friend requires nl ml? Actually, no: the requirement is per friend per toast.\n\n   Let me clarify: \n        In the example, one toast for one friend requires 3 ml. But when we have 3 friends, if we want to make t toasts for each, then we need 3*t*3 ml.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also think: the total number of toasts that can be made is limited by the drink: total_drink / (nl * n) [because each toast for one friend uses nl, and there are n friends]. But wait, actually the drink is consumed by the friends: each toast (by any friend) uses nl ml. And we have n friends each making t toasts -> total toasts = n*t, and total drink needed = n*t * nl.\n\n   However, note: the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". But wait, 20/3 is about 6.66 toasts. Why is that?\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   This suggests that they are considering that a toast is defined without specifying the friend? Actually, no: because the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast\". \n\n   But wait: the example is calculating the total toasts (without breaking down by friend) as 20 / 3? That doesn't match.\n\n   Let me break down the example:\n\n   They have 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. But if they are making toasts for multiple friends, then the same ml is used for multiple friends? Actually, no: each friend's toast is independent.\n\n   However, note: the example says: \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3\". So they are dividing by 3 (the number of friends). \n\n   What they did for drink: 20 ml / 3 ml per toast? That would be 6 toasts (if we ignore the fact that the toast is for one friend). But wait, the requirement per toast is 3 ml, but then if we have 3 friends, then 6 toasts would be distributed among 3 friends -> 2 toasts per friend.\n\n   Alternatively, they could have calculated:\n\n        total_toasts_possible_from_drink = total_drink / (nl)   [because each toast (by any friend) requires nl ml?]\n\n   But wait, that would be 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n\n   Then, the limes: total_slices / 1 = 80 toasts (each toast requires one slice).\n   Then, salt: p / np = 100/1 = 100 toasts.\n\n   Then the limiting factor is 6 toasts. But since there are 3 friends, each friend can only make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n   So the key is: the total number of toasts (across all friends) is limited by the resources, but then we divide by the number of friends to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n   However, wait: the example input says nl=3 (milliliters per toast) and np=1 (grams per toast). \n\n   But note: the requirement for a toast is for one friend. So if we have 3 friends, then the drink for one toast by one friend is 3 ml, but if we have three friends each having one toast, then the total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml.\n\n   Now, the example does: \n        Drink: 20 ml -> how many toasts (each toast being one friend's toast) can we have in total? \n            total_toasts_total = 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts (in total for all friends combined)\n\n        Then, we cannot have a fractional toast, so 6 toasts in total. Then each friend can have 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n   Similarly, for limes: total_slices = 80, and each toast requires one slice -> total toasts by all friends is 80. Then each friend can have 80 / 3 = 26.66 -> 26? But wait, we are limited by the drink. So the total toasts is 6, then each friend gets 2.\n\n   But wait, what if the total toasts is not divisible by the number of friends? Then we might not be able to give each friend the same integer number of toasts.\n\n   Example: if total toasts limit was 7, then 7/3 = 2.33 -> so each friend can make 2 toasts (and we have 6 toasts, leaving 1 toast unused). But the problem says \"provided they all drink the same amount\", so we cannot exceed the minimum resource and then have non-integer per-friend toasts.\n\n   Therefore, the approach is:\n\n        Step 1: Calculate the maximum total toasts (across all friends) that can be made from each resource:\n\n            total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl   [each toast requires nl ml, so the drink allows (k*l)//nl toasts?]\n            But wait: is that correct? Because the problem says \"each friend\" needs nl per toast. So if we have n friends, then the total toasts (not per friend) is (k*l) / (nl * n)? No.\n\n        Let me re-think:\n\n        We have two ways to look at it:\n\n        Option 1: \n            Let T be the total number of toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then:\n                Drink: T * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k * l) / nl\n                Lime: T * 1 <= c * d     => T <= c * d\n                Salt: T * np <= p        => T <= p / np\n\n            Then, the maximum T is the minimum of these three (taking integer part? but we can use floor division or integer division? Actually, we are counting whole toasts, so we take the floor of the real value? But note: the problem doesn't specify that we can use fractions of a toast. We can only use whole toasts.\n\n            Then, since we have n friends, each friend can make T_total / n toasts? But wait, if T_total is the total toasts (each toast is one friend's), then we need to divide by n. However, we must ensure that each friend gets the same integer number of toasts.\n\n            Actually, the problem says \"each friend makes the same amount\", and we are to find the number of toasts per friend.\n\n            But note: the total toasts must be divisible by n? Not necessarily. We can have:\n\n                T_total = floor(min((k*l)/nl, c*d, p/np))\n\n            Then, we cannot have fractional toasts. But the condition is that each friend must make the same integer number of toasts. So the maximum per friend is floor(T_total / n) ?\n\n            However, wait: we are constrained by T_total (the total toasts) must be at most the minimum of the three. And then we distribute T_total to n friends. But we want the maximum integer t such that:\n\n                n * t <= T_total   (from drink: n*t*nl <= k*l? Actually, no: our T_total already considers the drink constraint: T_total <= (k*l)/nl, so n*t <= T_total and T_total <= (k*l)/nl, then n*t*nl <= T_total * nl <= k*l? Actually, that is satisfied.)\n\n            Actually, the way we computed T_total is:\n\n                T_total = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   ??? \n\n            But wait: the drink constraint: T_total <= (k*l)/nl. However, note that the drink constraint is T_total * nl <= k*l. Similarly for the others.\n\n            However, the example: \n                n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3 -> (k*l)=20, then T_total_drink = 20/3 = 6.66 -> so the maximum T_total from drink is 6 (if we use integer division) but wait, we can have 6 toasts because 6*3=18<=20, but 7*3=21>20. \n\n            But the example did: 20/3 = 6.66... and then took 6.66... as 6 (without flooring in the example calculation, but then divided by 3 to get 2). Actually, the example didn't use integer division: they wrote 20/3=6 (meaning floor division?).\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", and we are using whole toasts.\n\n            So we should compute:\n\n                T_drink = (k * l) // nl   ? \n\n            But wait: (k*l) // nl gives the maximum number of toasts from the drink if we were making toasts independently (each toast requiring nl). However, note that in our total toasts T_total, each toast is for one friend. And the drink constraint is T_total * nl <= k*l. So the maximum T_total from drink is floor((k*l)/nl). But wait, we can use up to (k*l) ml, so the maximum T_total is floor((k*l)/nl) if we are making toasts that require nl each.\n\n            Similarly, for lime: T_total <= c*d (exactly, because we don't use fractions of a lime slice) -> so T_total_max_lime = c*d (but wait, we can only use whole slices, so we cannot use more than c*d slices, and each toast uses one, so T_total <= c*d). Similarly, salt: T_total * np <= p -> T_total <= p // np (if we use integer division) because we cannot use fractional grams.\n\n            However, note: the example salt: p=100, np=1 -> 100//1=100, but also 100/1=100, so same.\n\n            But wait, the drink: 20 // 3 = 6 (in integer division) but 20/3 is 6.66, so floor(20/3)=6.\n\n            So:\n\n                T_total = min( (k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np )   [using integer floor division] ?\n\n            However, wait: the drink constraint is T_total * nl <= k*l. If we do (k*l)//nl, then that is the maximum T_total from the drink because (k*l)//nl is the floor of (k*l/nl). Then T_total * nl <= k*l is satisfied.\n\n            Similarly for the others: \n                Lime: T_total <= c*d -> so we can set T_total = min(floor(k*l/nl), c*d, floor(p/np))? \n\n            But wait, for salt: the constraint is T_total * np <= p. The maximum T_total from salt is floor(p/np). \n\n            However, note: the drink and salt constraints are linear, so we can use:\n\n                T_total = min( (k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np )\n\n            But wait: what if (k*l) is not divisible by nl? Then (k*l)//nl is floor((k*l)/nl). Similarly, p//np is floor(p/np). But note: the constraints are:\n\n                T_total * nl <= k*l\n                T_total <= c*d\n                T_total * np <= p\n\n            And using T_total = min(floor(k*l/nl), c*d, floor(p/np)) ensures all constraints are met.\n\n            Then, the number of toasts per friend is T_total // n? \n\n            Let me test with the example:\n\n                n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n                T_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20 // 3 = 6\n                T_lime = 10*8 = 80\n                T_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n\n                T_total = min(6, 80, 100) = 6\n\n                Then per_friend = 6 // 3 = 2 -> matches.\n\n            But wait: what if T_total is not divisible by n? Then we do integer division (floor) and that gives the maximum integer t (toasts per friend) such that n*t <= T_total.\n\n            However, note: the condition is that the total toasts must be at least n*t. But we are taking the maximum T_total from the resources, and then we are distributing T_total to n friends. But we are allowed to have leftover toasts? The problem is: we want the maximum t (integer) such that:\n\n                n * t <= T_total   [because we can only use up to T_total toasts in total]\n\n            However, wait: the resource constraints are already accounted for by T_total. But note: the resource constraints are:\n\n                n*t * nl <= k*l   -> t <= (k*l)/(n*nl)   [this is a different view]\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [because for each friend, each toast requires nl, and there are n friends, so per friend the drink constraint is n*nl per toast?]\n\n            Then t2 = (c * d) // n   [because each friend needs one slice per toast, so total slices needed for t toasts per friend is n*t, so t <= (c*d)/n]\n\n            Then t3 = p // (n * np)   [because each friend needs np grams per toast, so total salt needed for t toasts per friend is n*t*np]\n\n            Then the answer is min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n            Let's test with the example:\n\n                t1 = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n                t2 = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n                t3 = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n                Then min(2,26,33) = 2 -> matches.\n\n            Which method is correct?\n\n            Both methods are valid, but they are two different ways to look at the constraints.\n\n            Method 1: \n                Total toasts (across friends) is T_total, then per friend is T_total // n.\n\n            Method 2:\n                Directly compute the maximum toasts per friend from each constraint.\n\n            However, note: the first method uses:\n\n                T_total = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n                then answer = T_total // n\n\n            The second method uses:\n\n                t1 = (k*l) // (n*nl)\n                t2 = (c*d) // n\n                t3 = p // (n*np)\n                then answer = min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n            Why are these equivalent?\n\n            Let me compare:\n\n            First method: \n                T_total = min( floor(k*l/nl), c*d, floor(p/np) )\n                Then per_friend = floor(T_total / n)\n\n            Second method:\n                t1 = floor( (k*l) / (n*nl) )\n                t2 = floor( (c*d) / n )\n                t3 = floor( p / (n*np) )\n                Then per_friend = min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n            But note: the drink constraint in the first method is: T_total <= (k*l)/nl, and then T_total / n <= (k*l)/(n*nl). So floor(T_total/n) <= floor((k*l)/(n*nl))? Not necessarily.\n\n            Example: \n                k*l = 20, nl=3, n=3 -> (k*l)/(n*nl)=20/9≈2.22 -> floor=2.\n                First method: T_total = 6, then 6//3=2 -> same.\n\n            Another example: \n                Suppose k*l=19, nl=3, n=3 -> T_total_drink = 19//3 = 6, then T_total=6, per_friend=6//3=2.\n                Second method: t1 = 19//(3*3)=19//9=2.\n\n            But what if the drink constraint is the limiting factor and the total toasts T_total is not divisible by n? \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, k=1, l=5, nl=2 -> drink: 5 ml. Each toast (per friend) requires 2 ml. So for two friends, one toast each: 4 ml -> so they can make 1 toast each (total 2 toasts). \n\n                First method:\n                    T_total_drink = 5 // 2 = 2 (toasts total)\n                    T_total = min(2, ...) [assuming other resources are sufficient] -> 2\n                    per_friend = 2 // 2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n                Second method:\n                    t1 = (1*5) // (2*2) = 5//4 = 1 -> correct.\n\n            Now, consider a case where the total toasts T_total is not divisible by n, and the drink is the limiting factor.\n\n            Example: \n                n=2, k=1, l=3, nl=2 -> drink: 3 ml. Each toast (per friend) requires 2 ml. For two friends, one toast each: 4 ml -> not enough. So they can only make one toast total (because 3<4). Then per_friend = 1 // 2 = 0.\n\n                Second method: t1 = (1*3) // (2*2) = 3//4 = 0 -> correct.\n\n            But wait, in the first method, T_total_drink = 3//2 = 1, so T_total=1, then per_friend=1//2=0.\n\n            Now, what if the limiting factor is not drink but something else, and the total toasts T_total is not divisible by n?\n\n            Example: \n                n=2, c=3, d=1, p=100, np=1, k=100, l=100, nl=1 -> but wait, let me fix: \n                Let's say n=2, c=5, d=1, p=100, np=1, k=100, l=100, nl=1.\n\n                Constraints:\n                    Drink: plenty (100*100) ml, so no problem.\n                    Lime: total slices=5, so total toasts=5 -> T_total=5.\n                    Salt: plenty.\n\n                Then per_friend = 5 // 2 = 2 (with 1 toast left over).\n\n                Second method: \n                    t1 = (10000) // (2*1) = 5000\n                    t2 = (5) // 2 = 2\n                    t3 = 100 // (2*1)=50\n                    so min(5000,2,50)=2 -> same.\n\n            So both methods yield the same result.\n\n            Why?\n\n            In the first method, T_total is the maximum total toasts (each toast for one friend) that can be made from all resources. Then we divide by n (using floor division) to get the maximum toasts per friend (each friend must have the same integer number, and we leave any remainder).\n\n            In the second method, we compute the maximum toasts per friend from each resource and take the minimum.\n\n            The second method is simpler and avoids computing T_total. But note: the constraints are linear and multiplicative.\n\n            However, note: the drink constraint in the second method: \n                t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)   -> because the drink needed for t toasts per friend is n*t*nl.\n\n            Similarly, lime: t <= (c*d) / n   [because we need n*t slices]\n            Salt: t <= p / (n*np)\n\n            So the maximum t (integer) is the floor of the minimum of these three.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            But wait: what if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl)? Then (k*l)//(n*nl) is floor division, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the drink constraint is n*t*nl <= k*l. The maximum t is floor(k*l/(n*nl)). Similarly for the others.\n\n            But wait: the lime constraint is n*t <= c*d. The maximum t is floor(c*d/n). Similarly for salt: n*t*np <= p -> t <= p/(n*np) -> floor(p/(n*np)).\n\n            So the answer is the minimum of these three.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the division must be integer division (floor) because we can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n            But note: the inputs are integers, and we are doing integer floor division.\n\n            Let me test the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n                n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n                t1 = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n                t2 = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n                t3 = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n                min(2,26,33)=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example 2: Input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\n                n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n                t1 = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n                t2 = (1*19) // 5 = 19 // 5 = 3\n                t3 = 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n                min(50,3,6)=3 -> correct.\n\n            Example 3: Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n                n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n                t1 = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n                t2 = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n                t3 = 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n                min(2000,57,0)=0 -> correct.\n\n            Therefore, the solution is:\n\n                Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n                Print(t)\n\n            But wait: what if n*nl is zero? The problem says positive integers, so n>=1, nl>=1, so n*nl>=1, so no division by zero.\n\n            Similarly, n>=1, so (c*d)//n is safe.\n\n            Also, n*np>=1, so p//(n*np) is safe.\n\n            However, note: the drink constraint: (k*l) // (n*nl) might be zero if k*l < n*nl, then that's okay.\n\n            Let me test with the third example: n=10, nl=50, k=1000, l=1000 -> drink is 1000000, and n*nl=500, so 1000000//500=2000 -> okay.\n\n            But wait, the third example has p=1, and n*np=10*1=10, so 1//10=0. So the answer is 0.\n\n            This matches the sample output.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\"\n\n            We are printing t, which is the integer.\n\n            Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                n = int(data[0])\n                k = int(data[1])\n                l = int(data[2])\n                c = int(data[3])\n                d = int(data[4])\n                p = int(data[5])\n                nl = int(data[6])\n                np = int(data[7])\n\n                # Calculate the maximum toasts per friend from each constraint\n                constraint1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n                constraint2 = (c * d) // n\n                constraint3 = p // (n * np)\n\n                ans = min(constraint1, constraint2, constraint3)\n                print(ans)\n\n            However, wait: what if the drink constraint is not the limiting factor, but the lime or salt is? Then we are taking the minimum.\n\n            This is correct because we need to satisfy all constraints.\n\n            But note: the drink constraint is (k*l) must be at least n*nl*t. Similarly for the others.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Let me run the examples again:\n\n            Example 1: n=3, k=4, l=5 -> constraint1=(20)//9=2; constraint2=80//3=26; constraint3=100//3=33 -> min=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example 2: n=5, k=100, l=10 -> constraint1=1000//20=50; constraint2=19//5=3; constraint3=90//15=6 -> min=3 -> correct.\n\n            Example 3: n=10, k=1000, l=1000 -> constraint1=1000000//500=2000; constraint2=575//10=57; constraint3=1//10=0 -> min=0 -> correct.\n\n            But wait, example 2: the expected output is 3. The example input was: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3' -> output '3'.\n\n            However, the example output provided in the problem is: \n                Input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 10 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n                Output: ['2', '3', '0']\n\n            I see: the second example input in the problem is written as: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3' but in the example output explanation they say: \n                \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> output 3.\n\n            But wait, the example output provided in the problem is: \n                ['2', '3', '0'] for the three inputs.\n\n            And the second input is: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3' -> so the fifth number is 1, then sixth is 19, seventh is 90, eighth is 4 and 3? \n\n            Actually, the input format: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n            So: \n                n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Note: We are reading 8 integers.\n\n            Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n            One more edge: if one of the constraints is negative? The problem states positive integers.\n\n            So we are safe.\n\n            Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n\n            t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t2 = (c * d) // n\n            t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n            ans = min(t1, t2, t3)\n            print(ans)\n\n            Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n            Example 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 -> 2\n            Example 2: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 -> 3\n            Example 3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 -> 0\n\n            It works.\n\n            However, wait: in the second example, the calculation for constraint2: (c*d)//n = (1*19)//5 = 19//5 = 3 (because 19//5 is 3 in integer division). And constraint3: 90//(5*3)=90//15=6. So min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n            But why is the drink constraint 50? Because (100*10)=1000 ml, and each friend's toast requires 4 ml (nl=4) and there are 5 friends, so 5*4=20 ml per toast (set of toasts for one round). Then 1000//20=50. So yes.\n\n            Therefore, we output 3.\n\n            The example output is 3.\n\n            But wait, the example output provided in the problem statement is: \n                Input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n                Output: ['2', '3', '0']\n\n            So we are good.\n\n            However, note: the example input in the problem statement has a typo? The second example input is written as: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'. But the problem says: \n                Input: \n                    ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n            And the output is: \n                ['2', '3', '0']\n\n            Our code produces these.\n\n            But wait: the example input string for the second one is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'. The numbers are: \n                n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            Yes.\n\n            Final code:\n\n            Read the input, split, convert to integers, then compute the three",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends make the same number of toasts while respecting the constraints imposed by the available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three constraints: the amount of drink available, the number of lime slices, and the amount of salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink (nl milliliters), one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt (np grams) per friend. The solution involves finding the limiting factor among these three resources when distributed equally among all friends.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution requires computing three separate values:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available (k * l) divided by the drink required per toast for all friends (n * nl).\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available (c * d) divided by the number of friends (n), as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available (p) divided by the salt required per toast for all friends (n * np).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves calculating these three values and selecting the smallest one, as this will be the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource constraint. The solution uses integer division to ensure whole numbers of toasts are considered.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t2 = (c * d) // n\n    t3 = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(t1, t2, t3)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends (n), bottles of drink (k), milliliters per bottle (l), number of limes (c), slices per lime (d), grams of salt (p), drink per toast (nl), and salt per toast (np).\n\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint (t1)**: Total drink (k * l) divided by the total drink needed per toast for all friends (n * nl).\n   - **Lime Constraint (t2)**: Total lime slices (c * d) divided by the number of friends (n), as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Constraint (t3)**: Total salt (p) divided by the total salt needed per toast for all friends (n * np).\n\n3. **Determining Result**: The smallest of the three calculated values (t1, t2, t3) is chosen as the result, ensuring no resource constraint is violated. This value represents the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while maintaining equality across all friends.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic and comparison operations to solve the problem within the given constraints, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
