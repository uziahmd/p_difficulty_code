He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2*n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with at least one string s of length n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n How can we approach?\n\n Observation:\n Since the string has length n, then:\n   - The prefix of length 1 must be the first character of the string.\n   - The suffix of length 1 must be the last character of the string.\n\n Also, for a given length L (from 1 to n-1), the prefix of length L is the first L characters, and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n Now, consider the following: \n   Let s = [c0, c1, ..., c_{n-1}]\n\n Then, the prefix of length L is: s[0:L]\n The suffix of length L is: s[n-L:n]\n\n Note: The two strings of length 1 must be the first and last characters.\n\n But note: what if the two strings of length 1 are the same? For example, in the second example: \n   Input for n=3: \n        3\n        a\n        aa\n        aa\n        a\n\n Here, the two strings of length 1 are both \"a\". So we can assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n However, the problem also states: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the input strings by their length. There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n 2. We need to decide for each string of a given length which one is prefix and which one is suffix.\n\n But note: the entire assignment must be consistent. What does consistency mean?\n   Consider two consecutive lengths: \n     Let P_i be the prefix of length i, and S_i be the suffix of length i.\n\n   Then, the prefix of length i must be the first i characters of s.\n   The suffix of length i must be the last i characters of s.\n\n   Moreover, for the same string, the next prefix should extend the previous one? Actually, we don't have the entire string, but we can use the following:\n\n   Consider the condition for two adjacent lengths: \n     For length L and L+1:\n        The prefix of length L+1 must be the prefix of length L plus one more character at the end.\n        The suffix of length L+1 must be one character at the beginning of the suffix of length L.\n\n   However, note: the problem doesn't require to output the string s, but only an assignment of P and S for the input strings.\n\n   But we must assign such that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes comes from one string s.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n   Since the string s of length n has two sets of prefixes and suffixes, we can try to determine the entire string s from the given set.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: From the length-1 group, we have two strings (possibly identical). One must be the first character and one the last.\n\n   Step 2: Similarly, for length 2, we have two strings. One is the first two characters, the other is the last two characters.\n\n   However, we don't know which is which.\n\n   We can try to build the string s by:\n\n      - The prefix of length 1 must be the first character, and the suffix of length 1 must be the last character.\n\n      - Then, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character.\n\n   But wait: we have two strings for each length. We can try to see which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n   However, the problem says: if there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n   Approach:\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Let's denote:\n      groups = defaultdict(list)\n      for each input string, add it to groups[len(string)]\n\n   Then, for each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two candidates for prefix and two for suffix? Actually, no: we have two strings for that length. We have to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n   However, we must ensure that the assignment is consistent.\n\n   How about:\n\n   Let s0 = the first character (from the length-1 group) and s_{n-1} = the last character (from the same group).\n\n   Then, the full string s must have:\n        s[0] = s0\n        s[n-1] = s_{n-1}\n\n   Now, for L from 1 to n-1, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n\n   Then, we can check for each length L, which of the two strings of length L is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n   But note: we don't know the entire string. We can use the following:\n\n        Condition for a string x of length L to be a prefix:\n            x[0] == s0   (if L>=1) and the next character if L>=2: x[1] must equal the second character of s, etc.\n\n        Similarly, for a string y of length L to be a suffix:\n            y[L-1] == s_{n-1}   (if L>=1) and also the first character of y must be the (n-L)th character of s, etc.\n\n   However, we don't know the entire string. But note: we know the first character and the last character.\n\n   We can try to reconstruct the string by using the condition that the prefix of length L must end with the same first part as the prefix of length L+1, and the suffix of length L must start with the same last part as the suffix of length L+1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Since the set of prefixes and suffixes are given, we can try to match the two strings of the same length by looking at their overlap with the known boundaries.\n\n   However, note the guarantee: the strings are prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n   Another idea:\n\n   We know that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must form a contiguous string. In particular, the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1 must be the first and last character.\n\n   Then, the prefix of length 2 must be the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 must be the last two characters.\n\n   How can we decide for each length?\n\n   Let F(L) be the two strings for length L: [A, B] (we don't know which is prefix and which is suffix).\n\n   Conditions for A being prefix and B being suffix:\n\n        Condition for A: \n            If L==1: then A must be the first character. But we know from the length-1 group that one of them is the first and one is the last. However, we don't know which one is which until we assign.\n\n        We cannot decide independently per length.\n\n   Instead, let us think: \n\n   We have two strings for length 1: say [x, y]. Then, we must assign one as the first character (prefix) and the other as the last character (suffix).\n\n   Then, for length 2, we have two strings [a, b]. \n\n        Condition for a being prefix: \n            a must start with x (the first character) and then the second character must be the one that will later match the condition for the suffix of length 2 (which must end with y, the last character) or not necessarily? Actually, the entire string s is fixed.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to output any assignment that is consistent.\n\n   How about: \n\n   We can fix the first character and the last character arbitrarily from the two available in the length-1 group.\n\n   Then, for each length L from 1 to n-1, we can check:\n\n        Candidate for prefix of length L: \n            It must be a string that starts with the first character (if L==1, then it's the first character; if L>1, then the first L-1 characters must be the prefix of length L-1? Not exactly, because we might have multiple possibilities for the prefix of length L-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n\n   We know the entire string s must satisfy:\n\n        s = p1 + p2 + ... + p_{n-1}   (but actually we don't know the intermediate parts)\n\n   But note: we have all the prefixes and suffixes. \n\n   There is a known fact: the set of all prefixes and suffixes of a string s of length n is uniquely determined by s, and vice versa, if two strings produce the same set (ignoring labels) then they are cyclic shifts? Actually, the problem says \"there is at least one string\", so we don't need to find s, just an assignment.\n\n   However, we must assign the labels.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n   Consider the two strings of length 1: [a, b]. We have two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: \n            prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b.\n\n        Possibility 2:\n            prefix1 = b, suffix1 = a.\n\n   Then, for each length L (starting from 2 to n-1):\n\n        We have two strings: [x, y]\n\n        Condition for x being prefix and y being suffix:\n\n            For x to be prefix: \n                x must start with the current known prefix of length 1 (which is either a or b). But wait, we don't know the entire prefix of length L-1. However, we have the two strings for length L-1. We have already assigned one of them as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n        Actually, we are building the assignment simultaneously.\n\n   This becomes complex.\n\n   Let me read the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: n=5, strings: ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'] -> but wait, the example input was given as a list of strings including the n.\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', ...]\n\n   But the problem says: The first line is n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\n   So the example input is:\n\n        5\n        ba\n        a\n        abab\n        a\n        aba\n        baba\n        ab\n        aba\n\n   But wait, there are 8 strings, which is 2*5-2 = 8. However, the example output is \"SPPSPSPS\"\n\n   Let me break down the example:\n\n        The two strings of length 1: ['a', 'a'] -> so two 'a's.\n        The two strings of length 2: ['ba', 'ab'] -> so two strings: 'ba' and 'ab'\n        The two strings of length 3: ['aba', 'bab']? But wait, the input has: 'abab', 'aba', 'baba' -> actually:\n\n        The input strings are:\n            'ba' -> len=2\n            'a' -> len=1\n            'abab' -> len=4\n            'a' -> len=1\n            'aba' -> len=3\n            'baba' -> len=4\n            'ab' -> len=2\n            'aba' -> len=3\n\n        So for length 1: two 'a'\n        length 2: two strings: 'ba' and 'ab'\n        length 3: two strings: 'aba' and 'aba'? Wait, there are two 'aba'? Actually, the input has two 'aba' for length 3? \n            First 'aba' (third string from the top) is from the list: \n                Input: \n                    5\n                    ba\n                    a\n                    abab\n                    a\n                    aba\n                    baba\n                    ab\n                    aba\n\n            The lengths: \n                2: 'ba'\n                1: 'a'\n                4: 'abab'\n                1: 'a'\n                3: 'aba'\n                4: 'baba'\n                2: 'ab'\n                3: 'aba'\n\n        So for length 3, we have two strings: 'aba' and 'aba'. They are the same.\n\n        Then, the example output is \"SPPSPSPS\", meaning:\n\n            The first string: 'ba' -> S (so suffix)\n            second: 'a' -> P (prefix)\n            third: 'abab' -> P (prefix)\n            fourth: 'a' -> S (suffix)\n            fifth: 'aba' -> S (suffix)\n            sixth: 'baba' -> P (prefix)\n            seventh: 'ab' -> S (suffix)\n            eighth: 'aba' -> P (prefix)\n\n        But wait, the example says the only string is \"ababa\". Let's check:\n\n            Prefixes of \"ababa\":\n                length1: 'a'\n                length2: 'ab'\n                length3: 'aba'\n                length4: 'abab'\n\n            Suffixes of \"ababa\":\n                length1: 'a'\n                length2: 'ba'\n                length3: 'aba'\n                length4: 'baba'\n\n        Now, let's map:\n\n            We have two 'a' for length1: one is prefix and one is suffix -> matches.\n\n            For length2: \n                prefix: 'ab'\n                suffix: 'ba'\n\n            For length3:\n                prefix: 'aba'\n                suffix: 'aba'   -> wait, but in our assignment we have two 'aba' for length3: one is prefix and one is suffix. But note: the string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of 'aba': \n                    prefix: 'aba' (first three letters) and \n                    suffix: 'aba' (last three letters) -> indeed, the suffix of length3 is the substring from index2 to index4: 'aba'.\n\n            For length4:\n                prefix: 'abab'\n                suffix: 'baba'\n\n        Now, in the input, the two strings of length4 are 'abab' and 'baba'. \n\n        How did we assign?\n            The assignment for the example output is: \n                'abab' -> P (prefix)\n                'baba' -> P (prefix) for the sixth string? Actually, the example output assigns the sixth string (which is 'baba') as prefix? But wait, the example output string is \"SPPSPSPS\", meaning:\n\n            The input order is:\n                0: 'ba' -> S\n                1: 'a' -> P\n                2: 'abab' -> P\n                3: 'a' -> S\n                4: 'aba' -> S\n                5: 'baba' -> P\n                6: 'ab' -> S\n                7: 'aba' -> P\n\n        So for length4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'. We assign:\n            'abab' (at position2) as prefix, and 'baba' (at position5) as prefix? But wait, we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        Actually, we must assign one string of length4 as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        The example output says:\n            'abab' is prefix (so that's correct for the string \"ababa\")\n            'baba' is prefix? But wait, the suffix of length4 of \"ababa\" is 'baba'. So we should assign 'baba' as suffix.\n\n        But the example output says the fifth string (which is 'baba') is assigned as prefix (because the fifth character in the output is 'P'). \n\n        Wait, let me count the output string: \"SPPSPSPS\" has 8 characters. The input has 8 strings. The assignment is:\n\n            String0: 'ba' -> S (so suffix)\n            String1: 'a' -> P (prefix)\n            String2: 'abab' -> P (prefix)\n            String3: 'a' -> S (suffix)\n            String4: 'aba' -> S (suffix)\n            String5: 'baba' -> P (prefix)   -> but wait, the expected suffix for length4 is 'baba', so this should be S, not P.\n\n        This seems inconsistent.\n\n        Let me check the example again: the example says the answer is \"SPPSPSPS\". \n\n        But according to the example, the string s is \"ababa\". Then:\n\n            The prefixes are: \n                length1: 'a'\n                length2: 'ab'\n                length3: 'aba'\n                length4: 'abab'\n\n            The suffixes are:\n                length1: 'a'\n                length2: 'ba'\n                length3: 'aba'\n                length4: 'baba'\n\n        Now, the input strings (with their lengths) are:\n\n            'ba' -> length2 -> must be a suffix (because the suffix of length2 is 'ba')\n            'a' -> length1 -> must be a prefix (because the prefix of length1 is 'a')\n            'abab' -> length4 -> must be a prefix (because the prefix of length4 is 'abab')\n            'a' -> length1 -> must be a suffix (because the suffix of length1 is 'a')\n            'aba' -> length3 -> must be a suffix (because the suffix of length3 is 'aba')\n            'baba' -> length4 -> must be a suffix (because the suffix of length4 is 'baba')\n            'ab' -> length2 -> must be a prefix (because the prefix of length2 is 'ab')\n            'aba' -> length3 -> must be a prefix (because the prefix of length3 is 'aba')\n\n        But wait, we have two 'aba' of length3. And the string \"ababa\" has two 'aba'? \n            prefix3: 'aba'\n            suffix3: 'aba'\n\n        So the two 'aba' for length3: one is prefix and one is suffix.\n\n        Now, the assignment for the two 'aba' (length3) is: one must be P and one must be S.\n\n        Similarly, for the two 'a' (length1): one P and one S.\n\n        Now, let's assign:\n\n            length1: \n                first occurrence of 'a' (second string) -> P\n                second occurrence of 'a' (fourth string) -> S\n\n            length2:\n                'ba' -> S (because the suffix of length2 is 'ba')\n                'ab' -> P (because the prefix of length2 is 'ab')\n\n            length3:\n                first occurrence of 'aba' (fifth string) -> S (because the suffix of length3 is 'aba')\n                second occurrence of 'aba' (eighth string) -> P (because the prefix of length3 is 'aba')\n\n            length4:\n                'abab' -> P (prefix of length4)\n                'baba' -> S (suffix of length4)\n\n        Then the output would be:\n\n            String0: 'ba' -> S -> 'S'\n            String1: 'a' -> P -> 'P'\n            String2: 'abab' -> P -> 'P'\n            String3: 'a' -> S -> 'S'\n            String4: 'aba' -> S -> 'S'\n            String5: 'baba' -> S -> 'S'   -> but wait, the example output has 'P' for this one.\n\n        Correction: the example output is \"SPPSPSPS\", so the fifth string (index5, which is the sixth line) is 'baba' and is assigned 'P'. But according to our reasoning, 'baba' should be S.\n\n        What's going on?\n\n        Let me reexamine the example input order:\n\n            The input is:\n\n                5\n                ba\n                a\n                abab\n                a\n                aba\n                baba\n                ab\n                aba\n\n            The example output is: \"SPPSPSPS\"\n\n            Meaning:\n\n                ba -> S\n                a -> P\n                abab -> P\n                a -> S\n                aba -> S   (this is the fifth string: the fifth string is 'aba')\n                baba -> P   (sixth string: 'baba')\n                ab -> S\n                aba -> P    (eighth string: 'aba')\n\n        Now, let's check consistency with s=\"ababa\":\n\n            Prefixes of \"ababa\": \n                length1: \"a\" -> the second string and the fourth string are both 'a'. We have one 'a' as prefix (the second string) and one as suffix (the fourth string). That matches.\n                length2: \"ab\" -> the seventh string is 'ab' and is assigned S -> that would imply that 'ab' is a suffix? But the suffix of length2 is \"ba\", not \"ab\". \n\n            Wait, the prefix of length2 is \"ab\", so the seventh string 'ab' must be a prefix. But the example output marks it as S (suffix). \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me check the example output again: the example output is \"SPPSPSPS\", and the seventh string is 'ab'. So:\n\n            The seventh string is the string \"ab\", which is the seventh input. The example output for the seventh character is 'S'.\n\n        But the prefix of length2 is \"ab\", so we must mark \"ab\" as P, not S.\n\n        I suspect the example explanation might have swapped the order.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended a different string? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is 'ababa'.\" \n\n        So the string is fixed as \"ababa\". Then the assignment must be:\n\n            For the string \"ababa\", the prefixes and suffixes are:\n\n                length1: prefix='a', suffix='a'\n                length2: prefix='ab', suffix='ba'\n                length3: prefix='aba', suffix='aba'\n                length4: prefix='abab', suffix='baba'\n\n        Now, the input provides two of each, but the order is arbitrary.\n\n        The two strings of length2 are: 'ba' and 'ab'. \n            'ab' must be prefix, so we mark the string 'ab' (which appears as the seventh string) as P.\n            'ba' must be suffix, so we mark the string 'ba' (which appears as the first string) as S.\n\n        Similarly, the two strings of length4 are: 'abab' and 'baba'. \n            'abab' is prefix -> P (third string: 'abab')\n            'baba' is suffix -> S (sixth string: 'baba')\n\n        The two strings of length3: two 'aba'\n            one is prefix, one is suffix -> so we mark one 'aba' as P and one as S.\n\n        The two strings of length1: two 'a'\n            one is prefix, one is suffix.\n\n        Now, let's assign:\n\n            String0: 'ba' (length2) -> must be S -> 'S'\n            String1: 'a' (length1) -> must be either P or S. But we have two 'a'. We have to assign one as P and one as S. We can choose arbitrarily.\n\n            However, the example output uses:\n\n                String0: 'ba' -> S\n                String1: 'a' -> P\n                String2: 'abab' -> P\n                String3: 'a' -> S\n                String4: 'aba' -> S   (for length3) -> wait, we have two 'aba'. We need to assign one as P and one as S. But the example output has two S for the two 'aba' (at positions4 and7). Actually, the example output has:\n\n                    String4: 'aba' -> S\n                    String7: 'aba' -> P\n\n            So that's acceptable.\n\n            String5: 'baba' (length4) -> must be S (suffix) -> example output says 'P' for the sixth string? \n\n        Wait, the example output string is \"SPPSPSPS\", meaning:\n\n            String0: 'ba' -> S\n            String1: 'a' -> P\n            String2: 'abab' -> P\n            String3: 'a' -> S\n            String4: 'aba' -> S\n            String5: 'baba' -> P   -> This is incorrect, because 'baba' should be S.\n            String6: 'ab' -> S   -> but wait, the seventh string is 'ab', and the example output has the seventh character as 'S' (the seventh character of \"SPPSPSPS\" is the 7th letter, which is the 7th assignment). However, the sixth assignment is for the sixth string 'baba', and the seventh assignment is for the seventh string 'ab'. \n\n        The example output \"SPPSPSPS\" has 8 letters. Let me index from 0:\n\n            index0: 'S' -> string0: 'ba'\n            index1: 'P' -> string1: 'a'\n            index2: 'P' -> string2: 'abab'\n            index3: 'S' -> string3: 'a'\n            index4: 'P' -> string4: 'aba'   -> wait, here we have a 'P' for the fifth string (which is 'aba')? \n            index5: 'S' -> string5: 'baba'\n            index6: 'P' -> string6: 'ab'\n            index7: 'S' -> string7: 'aba'\n\n        But wait, the example output string is \"SPPSPSPS\", which is:\n\n            S P P S P S P S\n\n        Actually, the example output string is \"SPPSPSPS\", which is 8 characters.\n\n        Breaking down:\n\n            S -> string0: 'ba'\n            P -> string1: 'a'\n            P -> string2: 'abab'\n            S -> string3: 'a'\n            P -> string4: 'aba'\n            S -> string5: 'baba'\n            P -> string6: 'ab'\n            S -> string7: 'aba'\n\n        Now, let's check with \"ababa\":\n\n            The two 'aba' (at index4 and index7) are both marked as P and S respectively? \n                index4: 'aba' -> P -> meaning it's a prefix. But the prefix of length3 is 'aba', so that's correct for the fourth string (index4) being 'aba' as prefix.\n                index7: 'aba' -> S -> meaning it's a suffix. The suffix of length3 is 'aba', so that's correct.\n\n            The two 'a' (index1 and index3):\n                index1: 'a' -> P -> prefix (correct)\n                index3: 'a' -> S -> suffix (correct)\n\n            The two 'ba' and 'ab' (index0 and index6):\n                index0: 'ba' -> S -> suffix (correct, because suffix of length2 is 'ba')\n                index6: 'ab' -> P -> prefix (correct, because prefix of length2 is 'ab')\n\n            The two 'abab' and 'baba' (index2 and index5):\n                index2: 'abab' -> P -> prefix (correct)\n                index5: 'baba' -> S -> suffix (correct)\n\n        So the example output is indeed \"SPPSPSPS\", but note that the example output string is written as \"SPPSPSPS\", which is:\n\n            S, P, P, S, P, S, P, S\n\n        But wait, the example output in the problem statement is given as:\n\n            Output: ['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n        And the example input was:\n\n            ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', ...]\n\n        So the example output is \"SPPSPSPS\", and we have verified that it is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the assignment is done by:\n\n            For each string in the input (in order) we look at its length L (from 1 to n-1) and then decide whether it is a prefix or suffix.\n\n        How to decide?\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute the grouping by length.\n\n          Step 2: For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n          Step 3: But note: the entire assignment must be consistent with a string s of length n.\n\n        How to ensure consistency?\n\n          We know the entire string s must be consistent: \n            s[0] = first character (from the length1 prefix)\n            s[-1] = last character (from the length1 suffix)\n\n          Then, for a string x of length L to be a prefix, we require that x == s[0:L].\n          For a string y of length L to be a suffix, we require that y == s[-L:].\n\n          However, we don't know s. But we can use the following:\n\n          Let's assume we have assigned some strings as prefixes and some as suffixes. Then, we can try to reconstruct s by:\n\n            s = (assigned prefix of length1) + (if we have assigned a prefix of length2, then the second character must be the second character of that prefix, etc.)\n\n          But we don't know the entire s from the prefixes alone because we only have one prefix per length.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          We know the first character (from the length1 prefix) and the last character (from the length1 suffix). Then, for the prefix of length2, it must start with the first character. Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with the last character.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"if there are several possible answers, you can print any\".\n\n        Proposed algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the 2n-2 strings.\n\n          Step 2: Group the strings by their length.\n\n          Step 3: We know the entire string s must start with the first character (from the length1 group) and end with the last character (from the length1 group). But wait, we have two strings in the length1 group. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n          How to assign the length1 group? \n\n            We can assign arbitrarily? But note: the entire set must be consistent.\n\n          Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let s0 = the two strings in the length1 group. They must be the first character and the last character.\n\n            Then, the rest of the assignments must be such that:\n\n                For length L>=2, the prefix of length L must start with s0 (the first char) and the suffix of length L must end with s_{n-1} (the last char).\n\n            However, we don't know which one is the first char and which is the last char.\n\n          So we have two possibilities for the length1 group:\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b\n\n            Possibility 2:\n                prefix1 = b, suffix1 = a\n\n          Then, for each possibility, we try to assign the other lengths.\n\n          But note: the problem says the strings are guaranteed to be from some string of length n.\n\n          We can try both possibilities and see which one works for the entire set. But the problem says we can output any.\n\n          However, we must output an assignment for the given input order.\n\n          Alternative Insight:\n\n          We can use the following:\n\n            We know that the prefix of length L is a string that, if we take the entire string s, must be the first L characters.\n\n            Similarly, the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n            Now, consider the two strings of length L: [x, y].\n\n            Condition for x to be a prefix: \n                x[0] == s0   (the first character of s)\n\n            Condition for x to be a suffix:\n                x[-1] == s_{n-1}   (the last character of s)\n\n            But wait, for a prefix we require the entire string x to be the first L characters, so the first character must be s0. For a suffix, the last character must be s_{n-1}.\n\n            However, we don't know s0 and s_{n-1} until we assign the length1.\n\n          So we must decide the length1 group first.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let g1 = group[length1] (two strings)\n\n            We'll consider two cases:\n\n            Case1: \n                Let s0 = g1[0], s_last = g1[1]\n\n            Case2:\n                Let s0 = g1[1], s_last = g1[0]\n\n            Then, for each case, for each length L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                Let gL = group[L] (two strings)\n\n                For each string in gL, check:\n\n                    If we are to assign it as prefix, then it must start with s0 (the first character of s) and also the entire string must be consistent with the previously assigned prefix of length L-1? \n\n                But wait, we don't have the entire s. However, we can use the following:\n\n                    For a string x of length L to be a prefix, we require:\n                        x[0] == s0   (condition1)\n\n                    Additionally, if L>=2, we also require that the prefix of length L-1 (which we have already assigned) must be the prefix of x (i.e., the first L-1 characters of x must be the assigned prefix of length L-1).\n\n                    Similarly, for a string x of length L to be a suffix, we require:\n                        x[-1] == s_last   (condition2)\n\n                    And the suffix of length L-1 (assigned) must be the last L-1 characters of x.\n\n            However, note: we haven't assigned the entire set for the other lengths. We are assigning simultaneously.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require to output the string s, only an assignment. And we can output any.\n\n          Given the complexity, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Group by length.\n\n            Step 2: Extract the two strings for length1. Let them be A and B.\n\n            Step 3: We have two possibilities: \n                Possibility1: (s0, s_last) = (A, B)\n                Possibility2: (s0, s_last) = (B, A)\n\n            Then, for each possibility, we can try to assign the rest:\n\n                We'll create an array for the assignment for each string (by the original order) and also keep track of the assigned prefix and suffix for each length.\n\n            However, the input order is arbitrary, and we have to output the assignment in the input order.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Since the problem is small (n<=100, but the total strings is 2*n-2 <= 198), we can try to reconstruct the entire string s for both possibilities and see which one works. Then, based on the reconstruction, assign P/S.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"There is at least one string\", and we are guaranteed that the given set is from some string.\n\n          How to reconstruct s for a given possibility (s0, s_last)?\n\n            We know the first character is s0 and the last is s_last.\n\n            Then, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n\n            Also, the entire string must satisfy:\n\n                For each length L from 1 to n-1, one of the two strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n            We can try to build the string s incrementally:\n\n                s[0] = s0\n\n                Then, for L=2, the prefix of length2 must be s0 + c, where c is the next character.\n\n                Similarly, the suffix of length2 must be c + s_last.\n\n                But note: the prefix of length2 is one of the two strings of length2. Similarly, the suffix of length2 is the other.\n\n            Steps for a possibility:\n\n                Let s = [s0] + [unknown]*(n-2) + [s_last]\n\n                For L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                    We have two strings for length L: [x, y]\n\n                    We know that the prefix of length L must be the first L characters of s, and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n                    But we don't know the entire s.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                Let P = {}  # mapping from length to the prefix string (if assigned) for this possibility\n                Let S = {}  # mapping from length to the suffix string\n\n                For L=1:\n                    We assign one of the two length1 strings to be the prefix and the other to be the suffix.\n\n                Then, for L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                    We have two strings: [a, b]\n\n                    Condition for a being prefix:\n                        a[0] == s0   (first char) and \n",

The solution involves grouping these strings by their lengths and then determining the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) for each string such that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes corresponds to at least one valid string `s` of length `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, this grouping helps in systematically processing each length.\n2. **Handling Length 1 Strings**: The strings of length 1 must be the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix) of the hidden string `s`. There are two possibilities: either the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa. We need to check both possibilities to ensure consistency with the rest of the strings.\n3. **Checking Consistency for Other Lengths**: For each subsequent length `L` (from 2 to `n-1`), we check the two strings in the group:\n   - A string can be a prefix if it starts with the first character (from the length 1 prefix) and its first `L-1` characters match the prefix of length `L-1`.\n   - A string can be a suffix if it ends with the last character (from the length 1 suffix) and its last `L-1` characters match the suffix of length `L-1`.\n4. **Selecting Valid Assignment**: For each length, we choose the string that fits either as a prefix or a suffix based on the above conditions. If both strings fit, we choose one arbitrarily, ensuring the other can be the opposite (prefix or suffix). The chosen assignment must be consistent across all lengths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n

string, followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Checking Possibilities**: Two possibilities for assigning the first and last characters (from length 1 strings) are considered. For each possibility, the algorithm checks if the remaining strings can be assigned as prefixes or suffixes consistently.\n4. **Consistency Check**: For each length from 2 to `n-1`, the algorithm checks if a string can be a prefix (starts with the previous prefix) or a suffix (ends with the previous suffix). If both conditions are met, it chooses one arbitrarily.\n5. **Output Result**: The first valid assignment found is printed. If no assignment is found (though the problem guarantees one exists), a fallback method is used to assign 'P' or 'S' based on initial checks.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible assignments by leveraging the structure of prefixes and suffixes, ensuring correctness through systematic checks and fallback mechanisms.",
