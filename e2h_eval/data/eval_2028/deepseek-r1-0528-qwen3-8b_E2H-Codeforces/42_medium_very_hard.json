Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. So total data is at most 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n\n We are to find all integers p in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying when:\n   (1) The current file's progress bar shows p: i.e., for some file i and some byte x (0 <= x <= a_i-1) we have:\n        floor( (100 * x) / a_i ) = p   --> which means p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        => x must be in [ ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) ]? Actually, note: \n        Condition: p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        => (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n        Since x is an integer, then x_min = ceil( (p * a_i) / 100 ) but note: if (p*a_i) is divisible by 100, then x_min = (p*a_i)//100, but wait: the condition is inclusive at the lower bound.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n          p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        Multiply by a_i: p*a_i <= 100*x < (p+1)*a_i\n        Then x must be in [ ceil(p*a_i/100) , floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1) ]? \n\n        But note: because of floor, the value is taken as integer division. However, we can define:\n          x_min = ceil(p * a_i / 100)   [because if x were less than ceil, then floor(100*x/a_i) would be < p]\n          Actually, let me check: \n            Let L = (p * a_i) / 100, then the smallest x satisfying 100*x >= p*a_i is x0 = ceil(L). But note: if L is integer, then x0 = L, and then 100*x0 = p*a_i -> floor(p*a_i/100)=p? Actually, no: because then (100*x0)/a_i = p exactly, so floor is p. But what if x0 = L+1? Then 100*x0 = 100*(L+1) = 100*L + 100 = p*a_i + 100. Then (100*x0)/a_i = p + 100/a_i, which might be >= p+1 if 100/a_i >=1? Actually, no: because a_i>=1, then 100/a_i <=100, so it could be that p+1 <= (p*a_i+100)/a_i = p+100/a_i, and then floor might be p or p+1? \n\n        Actually, we can think: the condition is that x must be at least ceil(p*a_i/100) and strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100. Since x is integer, the upper bound is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9). Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        x must satisfy: \n            x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100)\n            x < (p+1)*a_i/100   -> so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)\n\n        However, note that if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then x must be strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum x is (p+1)*a_i/100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n            x_min = ceil(p * a_i / 100)\n            x_max = floor( (p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-12 )   [to avoid floating point issues]\n\n        But note: the problem says the first progress bar updates after each byte, so at x=ceil(p*a_i/100) we get p, and then until x_max (inclusive) we get p, and then at x_max+1 we get p+1.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the second condition is about the overall progress.\n\n (2) The overall progress bar shows p: i.e., for the same moment (same file i and byte x) we have:\n        floor( (100 * (total_bytes_copied)) / (total_bytes) ) = p\n        where total_bytes_copied = (a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}) + x\n\n        This means: p <= (100 * total_bytes_copied) / total_all < p+1\n        => (p * total_all) <= 100 * total_bytes_copied < (p+1)*total_all\n\n        Let T = total_all = sum(a1 to an)\n        Then total_bytes_copied = S + x, where S = sum(a1 to a_{i-1})\n        So: p*T <= 100*(S+x) < (p+1)*T\n\n        => x >= ceil( (p*T - 100*S) / 100 )   [if positive, else 0] and x < (p+1)*T/100 - S\n\n        But note: x must be an integer between 0 and a_i.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all moments (because total bytes is up to 100000) and n up to 100, so total steps 100000*100 = 10e6 which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be cautious.\n\n But note: we are only asked for the set of p in [0,100] that occur at some moment.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We know that the two conditions must hold simultaneously for some file i and some byte x (0<=x<=a_i).\n\n For each file i, we can consider the set of p values that appear in the first progress bar for that file. Then, for each p that appears in file i, we can check if there is a moment (in file i) such that the overall progress bar also shows p.\n\n How?\n\n Step 1: Precompute the total size T = sum(a)\n\n Step 2: For each file i (from 0 to n-1), we know:\n   Let S_i = sum(a_0 to a_{i-1})   [the bytes copied before starting file i]\n   Then, during file i, we copy x bytes (from 0 to a_i). Then the overall progress is:\n        p_overall = floor( (100 * (S_i + x)) / T )\n\n   And the first progress bar for file i at x bytes is:\n        p_file = floor( (100*x) / a_i )\n\n   We want to know: for a given p (which is both the file progress and the overall progress) and for file i, does there exist an integer x (0<=x<=a_i) such that:\n        p_file = p   and   p_overall = p.\n\n   But note: p must be the same for both.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate by p from 0 to 100, and check if there exists any file i and any x in [0, a_i] such that:\n        floor(100*x / a_i) == p and floor(100*(S_i+x)/T) == p.\n\n However, iterating p from 0 to 100 (101 values) and for each p, iterate over all files i (up to 100) and for each file, we can check the x range that gives p for the file, and then check the overall condition for the same x.\n\n But note: for a fixed file i and p, the x must be in [x_low, x_high] for the file, and also must satisfy the overall condition.\n\n The overall condition for a given (i, x) is:\n        p <= (100*(S_i+x)) / T < p+1\n\n Rearranged for x:\n        (p * T - 100*S_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*T - 100*S_i) / 100\n\n And for the file condition, we already have:\n        (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i) / 100\n\n So for file i and p, x must be in the intersection of these two intervals and also in [0, a_i].\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   For each p from 0 to 100:\n        found = False\n        For each file index i from 0 to n-1:\n            Let S_i = prefix_sum[i]   (the sum of the first i files, i.e., a0 to a_{i-1})\n            Let A = a_i\n\n            Condition for the file: \n                x must be in [x1, x2] where:\n                    x1 = ceil( (p * A) / 100.0 )   [if (p*A) % 100 == 0 then x1 = (p*A)//100, but ceil works for non-integer too]\n                    Actually, we can use: x1 = (p * A + 99) // 100   [this is ceiling without using floats?] \n                    But wait: ceiling of (p*A/100) = (p*A + 99) // 100? \n                        Example: p*A=50 -> (50+99)//100 = 149//100 = 1 -> but ceil(0.5)=1, correct.\n                        Example: p*A=100 -> (100+99)//100 = 199//100=1 -> but ceil(1)=1, correct.\n\n                    However, note: if (p*A) is 0 then x1=0, which is correct.\n\n                But wait: the condition is p <= (100*x)/A < p+1, which is equivalent to:\n                    x >= ceil(p*A/100) and x < (p+1)*A/100.\n\n                The upper bound is exclusive. So x must be <= floor((p+1)*A/100 - 1e-9). Alternatively, we can use:\n                    x2 = floor( (p+1)*A/100 - 1e-9 )   but we can also use integer arithmetic: \n                    x2 = (p+1)*A // 100   ??? Not exactly: because if (p+1)*A is divisible by 100, then x2 should be (p+1)*A//100 - 1? \n\n                Actually, we want the largest integer x such that (100*x) < (p+1)*A, so x < (p+1)*A/100 -> x <= floor((p+1)*A/100 - 1e-9). \n\n                We can compute: x2 = min(A, (p+1)*A // 100) ? No, because (p+1)*A//100 might be larger than A? Then we take min(A, floor((p+1)*A/100))? Actually, x cannot exceed A.\n\n                Alternatively, we can define:\n                    x1 = (p * A + 99) // 100   [ceiling of p*A/100]\n                    x2 = (p+1)*A // 100   [floor of (p+1)*A/100] but wait: is that correct?\n\n                Let me test with p=0, A=100: \n                    x1 = (0+99)//100 = 0\n                    x2 = (1*100)//100 = 1 -> then x in [0,1) -> so x=0 only. Correct: at x=0, floor(0)=0; at x=1, floor(100/100)=1.\n\n                Now p=1, A=100:\n                    x1 = (100+99)//100 = 199//100 = 1\n                    x2 = (2*100)//100 = 2 -> so x in [1,2) -> x=1 only. Correct: at x=1, floor(100*1/100)=1; at x=2, floor(200/100)=2.\n\n                But wait: the condition for the file is that the progress bar shows p=1, which happens at x from 1 to just below 2. So x=1 is the only one.\n\n                However, note: the condition for the overall progress: \n                    p <= (100*(S_i+x))/T < p+1.\n\n            Now, for the same p and file i, we require x to be in the intersection of [x1, x2] (with x2 being exclusive) and [0, A] and also in the interval for the overall progress:\n\n                    x_low_overall = ceil( (p * T - 100*S_i) / 100.0 )   [if (p*T - 100*S_i) is negative, then we use 0?] Actually, the condition is:\n                    x >= ceil( (p*T - 100*S_i) / 100 )   [but if (p*T - 100*S_i) is negative, then the condition is automatically satisfied for x>=0]\n\n            But note: the overall condition is: \n                    p*T <= 100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T\n                => 100*(S_i+x) >= p*T and 100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T\n\n                => x >= ceil( (p*T - 100*S_i) / 100 )   [if (p*T - 100*S_i) is negative, then ceil(...) is negative, so we take max(0, ceil(...))]\n\n            However, note: if (p*T - 100*S_i) is negative, then even x=0 satisfies the lower bound. So the lower bound for x from the overall condition is:\n                x_low_overall = max(0, ceil( (p*T - 100*S_i) / 100 ))\n\n            Similarly, the upper bound for the overall condition is:\n                x < ( (p+1)*T - 100*S_i ) / 100\n                => x <= floor( ( (p+1)*T - 100*S_i - 1) / 100 )   [if we use integer arithmetic, but note: we are dealing with integers?]\n\n            Actually, we can use:\n\n                x_low_overall = (p*T - 100*S_i + 99) // 100   [ceiling trick] but careful: if (p*T - 100*S_i) is negative, then (p*T - 100*S_i + 99) // 100 might be negative and then we set to 0.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                low_bound = (p * T - 100 * S_i + 99) // 100\n                if low_bound < 0:\n                    low_bound = 0\n                high_bound = ((p+1)*T - 100*S_i - 1) // 100   [because x must be < (p+1)*T/100 - S_i, so x <= floor(( (p+1)*T - 100*S_i - 1) / 100) ]\n\n            However, note: the condition is 100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T\n                => S_i+x < (p+1)*T/100\n                => x < (p+1)*T/100 - S_i\n                Since x is integer, the maximum x is floor((p+1)*T/100 - S_i - 1e-9). But (p+1)*T/100 - S_i might not be integer.\n\n            We can also use:\n\n                low_bound = max(0, (p*T - 100*S_i + 99) // 100)\n                high_bound = min(A, (p+1)*T//100 - (S_i + 1))   # but wait, this is not linear.\n\n            Actually, let's reframe: The overall condition requires:\n                100*(S_i+x) >= p*T   --> x >= ceil((p*T - 100*S_i)/100) [if positive, else 0]\n                100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T --> x <= floor(( (p+1)*T - 1 - 100*S_i) / 100)   [because 100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T  => x < (p+1)*T/100 - S_i, so x <= floor((p+1)*T/100 - S_i - 1e-9) ]\n\n            But note: we are working with integers, so we can use:\n\n                low_bound = max(0, (p * T - 100 * S_i + 99) // 100)   # ceiling of (p*T-100*S_i)/100, but if negative then 0.\n                high_bound = min(A, (p+1)*T - 100*S_i - 1) // 100   # because x must be integer and satisfy 100*(S_i+x) < (p+1)*T, so 100*(S_i+x) <= (p+1)*T - 1, then x <= ((p+1)*T - 1 - 100*S_i) // 100\n\n            However, wait: (p+1)*T might be huge, but note T is at most 100000, so (p+1)*T is at most 101*100000=10100000, which is acceptable.\n\n            But note: the condition for the overall progress must hold at the same time as the file condition.\n\n            Then, the x must be in the intersection of:\n                [x1, x2] from the file condition (with x1 = (p*A+99)//100, and x2 = (p+1)*A//100, but note: the file condition is x in [x1, x2-1] if we use integer floor division for the upper bound?

For each file, we need to check if there exists a byte position where both the current file's progress and the overall progress (across all files) match a specific percentage `p` (from 0 to 100).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each percentage `p`, we need to verify if there exists any file and any byte position within that file such that:\n   - The current file's progress reaches `p` (i.e., `(100 * x) / a_i` rounded down equals `p`).\n   - The overall progress also reaches `p` (i.e., `(100 * (sum of previous files + x)) / total_size` rounded down equals `p`).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sums**: Precompute the cumulative sizes of the files to efficiently calculate the sum of bytes processed before each file.\n   - **Range Checking**: For each file and each percentage `p`, determine the range of bytes `x` that would make the current file's progress equal to `p`. Similarly, determine the range of bytes `x` that would make the overall progress equal to `p`. The intersection of these ranges must be non-empty for `p` to be valid.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating over each of the 101 possible percentages (0 to 100) and each of the up to 100 files. For each combination, the operations are constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(100 * n), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    T = sum(a)\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    results = set()\n    for p in range(0, 101):\n        found = False\n        for i in range(n):\n            S_i = prefix_sum[i]\n            A = a[i]\n            x1 = (p * A + 99) // 100\n            x2 = (p+1) * A // 100\n            if x2 < x1:\n                continue\n            else:\n                x_high_file = x2 - 1\n                if x_high_file < x1:\n                    continue\n\n            low_bound_val = p * T - 100 * S_i\n            if low_bound_val < 0:\n                low_bound = 0\n            else:\n                low_bound = (low_bound_val + 99) // 100\n\n            high_bound_val = (p+1)*T - 100*S_i - 1\n            if high_bound_val < 0:\n                continue\n            high_bound = high_bound_val // 100\n\n            L_intersect = max(x1, low_bound)\n            R_intersect = min(x_high_file, high_bound, A)\n            \n            if L_intersect <= R_intersect:\n                found = True\n                break\n        \n        if found:\n            results.add(p)\n    \n    for p in sorted(results):\n        print(p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums array helps in quickly accessing the total size of all files processed before each file.\n3. **Percentage Check**: For each percentage `p` (0 to 100), the code checks every file to see if there exists a byte position `x` within the file such that both the current file's progress and the overall progress reach `p`.\n4. **Range Intersection**: For each file and percentage, the code calculates the valid byte ranges for both progress bars. If these ranges overlap, the percentage `p` is valid.\n5. **Output**: The valid percentages are collected in a set to avoid duplicates and then printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible percentages by leveraging mathematical range calculations and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
