His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour points (a) and the second tour points (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that ai + bj >= x\", meaning Vasya's score is at least x.\n\n However, note: the problem states that there are no names, so we have to consider all participants. The catch is that Vasya is one of them, but we don't know which one. Actually, the input gives two arrays: the first tour points and the second tour points for the same set of participants, but in arbitrary order.\n\n Important: Each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The total score for a participant is the sum of his/her two scores.\n\n We are to compute:\n   Best place: the highest rank Vasya can get (lowest number)\n   Worst place: the lowest rank Vasya can get (highest number)\n\n How?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the true Vasya be one participant with (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which participant is Vasya. But wait: the input gives two arrays of n numbers. And we know that there exists at least one participant (Vasya) with total points >= x.\n\n But here's the key: the problem does not tell us which pair (a_i, b_j) belongs to Vasya. However, we are allowed to assign the pairs arbitrarily? Actually, we are given two lists: the first tour scores and the second tour scores. Each participant has one score from the first list and one from the second list, but the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n So, we can think: we have two multisets of numbers: A (first tour) and B (second tour). We are allowed to form n pairs (each element from A and each from B used exactly once). Then, for each participant, we have a total = a_i + b_j.\n\n Now, we need to consider:\n\n  Best place: What is the minimum rank Vasya can achieve?\n      We want to assign the pairs so that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and then we can arrange the others arbitrarily (but we have fixed sets A and B). However, note: we are also constrained by the fact that we must use each element exactly once.\n\n  Worst place: What is the maximum rank Vasya can achieve?\n      Similarly, we want to assign the pairs so that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and then arrange the others.\n\n However, note: the condition is that Vasya must have at least x points. So for worst place, we are forced to use a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x, but we can choose the worst possible assignment for the rest.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to combine the two lists and consider all pairs. But note: the problem doesn't require to know which pair is Vasya's, just the best and worst place.\n\n Observation:\n\n To compute the best place:\n\n   We want to maximize Vasya's total score (so that he stands out as much as possible). Then, we can assign the remaining scores arbitrarily to minimize the number of participants with higher total than Vasya.\n\n   However, we cannot arbitrarily assign because we have two fixed multisets. But note: the problem allows the jury to assign places arbitrarily in case of ties. \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   - We are allowed to choose any two numbers (one from A and one from B) for Vasya, as long as the two numbers come from the two given lists (and we are using each element exactly once). But note: the pairing is fixed for the entire set. However, we are allowed to choose which two numbers are assigned to Vasya (as long as they are one from A and one from B) and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n   But wait: the problem states that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour (so two arrays) and the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. Then, we are told that Vasya was present, meaning one of the participants is Vasya. However, we don't know which one. Therefore, we can assume that the two arrays are the two sets of scores for the n participants, and we are free to assign the second array to the first in any way (matching the first array to the second). \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the results have only points, no names\". So we have two sets of n numbers. Then, the total set of pairs is the set of all (a_i, b_j) for i,j from 0 to n-1? But note: each participant gets one a_i and one b_j. And each a_i and each b_j is used exactly once.\n\n   Therefore, we must form a perfect matching between the two sets.\n\n   However, we are not required to output the matching, but the best and worst place Vasya can get.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the total score for each participant if we fix a matching. But we don't know the matching.\n\n   We can use the following:\n\n   Let S be the multiset of all pairs (a_i, b_j) but we are going to form a matching. We are free to choose which matching? Actually, the problem does not specify how the matching is formed. But note: the two arrays are given independently. \n\n   However, we can consider:\n\n   We are going to consider the entire set of participants (n participants) and we are going to form a matching. We can assign the two arrays arbitrarily. But note: the problem does not say that the two arrays are the two sets of scores for the same participants in different orders. Actually, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\".\n\n   So, we have two arrays of length n. We can form a matching by pairing the first array with the second array arbitrarily. But the key is: we are allowed to choose which two numbers (from the two arrays) belong to Vasya, and then the rest are assigned arbitrarily (but we have to use each element once).\n\n   Actually, the problem does not require to form a complete matching? It says: \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning there are n participants, and we have two arrays of n numbers. So we have to assign each a_i to a b_j, and each participant gets one a_i and one b_j.\n\n   But note: the condition for Vasya: his total is at least x. However, we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's, as long as the entire matching uses each element exactly once.\n\n   So, to compute the best and worst place, we can:\n\n   Idea:\n\n   Let M = the set of all participants (n). We are going to consider the entire set of n pairs (each from A and B) and then remove one pair (for Vasya) and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n   However, we are allowed to choose any pair for Vasya (from A and B) as long as the pair is available? Actually, the entire set of pairs is the Cartesian product? But no: we have two multisets, and we are forming a matching. The matching is a bijection between the two sets? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that the participants are distinct or that the scores are distinct. But we are given two arrays.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\". So there are n participants, and we have two lists of n numbers (each list is the score of the n participants in the first/second tour, but the order is arbitrary). Therefore, we can form a matching arbitrarily.\n\n   This means: we can assign the second array to the first arbitrarily. So the entire set of pairs is the Cartesian product? No, because we have n elements in A and n in B, and we are forming a matching (each element in A is paired with exactly one element in B and vice versa). So the matching is a permutation.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require to form a specific matching. We can choose any matching for the entire set, and then Vasya is one of the participants (so we can choose which pair is Vasya's, and the rest is fixed by the matching).\n\n   However, we are not constrained by the matching beyond the fact that we use each element once.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We are going to:\n\n   1. Combine the two arrays and form an array of the total scores for all possible participants? Actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can consider the entire set of pairs (but note: we have to use each element once).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following known idea:\n\n   We can sort both arrays.\n\n   For best place:\n\n     We want to assign the highest possible total to Vasya, and then assign the other totals as low as possible (to minimize the number of participants with higher total than Vasya).\n\n     However, we cannot assign arbitrarily: we have two fixed multisets.\n\n     Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let A_sorted = sorted(first array, reverse=True)\n        Let B_sorted = sorted(second array, reverse=True)\n\n        But note: we are free to assign the second array arbitrarily to the first. So to maximize Vasya's total, we can take the largest element in A and the largest element in B? Not necessarily, because we are constrained by the entire matching.\n\n        However, we can choose any pair for Vasya. So the maximum total Vasya can get is max_{i,j} (a_i + b_j) = max(A) + max(B). But wait, we have to use each element once. So if we assign the largest a_i and the largest b_j to Vasya, then the rest of the participants are assigned the remaining elements arbitrarily. Then, the rest of the participants cannot have a total greater than the next highest possible? \n\n        Actually, for the best place:\n\n          We want to maximize Vasya's total and minimize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya.\n\n          How?\n\n          We can assign the two largest numbers (from A and B) to Vasya, then the rest of the participants will have totals that are the sums of the remaining numbers. But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the remaining numbers to the other participants arbitrarily. However, we cannot exceed the constraints of the two multisets.\n\n        Alternate known solution for problems like \"best and worst rank\":\n\n          Step 1: Sort the first array in descending order: A1, A2, ..., An.\n          Step 2: Sort the second array in descending order: B1, B2, ..., Bn.\n\n          Then, to compute the best place:\n\n            We want to assign the highest possible total to Vasya. But note: the entire set of participants must use all the numbers. \n\n            However, we can simulate:\n\n            Let's assume we assign the highest total to Vasya. Then, we can assign the remaining numbers to the other participants in a way that minimizes the number of participants with total greater than Vasya.\n\n            But note: the total of a participant is the sum of one element from A (without replacement) and one from B (without replacement). \n\n            Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Consider: We want to assign the highest total to Vasya, then we want to assign the remaining numbers so that as few as possible participants have a total greater than Vasya.\n\n            However, we can also consider: what if we take the top k participants? The top k participants would have the k largest totals.\n\n            How to count the number of participants with total > s (for some s)?\n\n            But note: the entire set of pairs (from the two arrays) is fixed. The set of all possible totals is the set {a_i + b_j for all i, j}. However, we are constrained by the matching.\n\n            Known similar problem: Codeforces problems about assigning two arrays to get best and worst rank.\n\n            Another idea: \n\n            We can consider the entire set of pairs without worrying about the matching? Actually, no: because the matching must use each element once, the set of pairs we can form is exactly the set of pairs (a_i, b_j) for i=0..n-1, j=0..n-1? But no, because we have to assign each element once. Actually, the matching is a bijection from the set of participants (which we don't know) to the two arrays? \n\n            Wait, note: the two arrays are given. We have two arrays of n numbers. We are allowed to form a matching (bijection) between the two arrays. Then, the set of pairs is fixed by the matching.\n\n            But note: the problem does not specify that the participants are labeled. So we can consider the two arrays as two sets of n numbers. Then, we are going to form a matching (each element from the first array is matched to an element from the second array). Then, we are going to pick one of these n pairs as Vasya's.\n\n            Then, the rest n-1 pairs form the other participants.\n\n            Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            Let T = [a_i + b_j] for the chosen matching. Then, we are free to choose the matching and then choose one of the n pairs (with total >= x) as Vasya's.\n\n            So the problem reduces to:\n\n            We have two multisets A and B. We form a matching (bijection) between A and B. Then, we select one element from the set of n pairs (each element being a sum a+b) that is at least x. Then, we want the best and worst rank (position) that Vasya can get.\n\n            The rank is determined by:\n\n              Sort the n pairs (the entire set) in descending order. Then, if Vasya has a total t, then his rank is the smallest integer r such that there are at most r-1 participants with total > t, and then there might be ties.\n\n            But note: the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily in case of ties, so we can break ties arbitrarily to either help or harm Vasya.\n\n            Therefore, for best place:\n\n              We can choose a matching and then choose Vasya's pair so that:\n\n                - Vasya's total is as large as possible (max_total = max_A + max_B, but note: we have to use the entire set, so if we assign the maximum of A and maximum of B to Vasya, then the rest of the matching is the remaining n-1 elements of A and n-1 elements of B).\n\n                Then, the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total is minimized.\n\n            Similarly, for worst place:\n\n              We choose a matching and then choose Vasya's pair (with total >= x) such that:\n\n                - The total is as small as possible (min_total = min{ a_i+b_j >= x } over the entire set? but we have to assign the entire set).\n\n                Then, the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total is maximized (because the jury can break ties arbitrarily, so we can assume that all participants with total >= Vasya's total are ranked above him).\n\n            However, note: the matching is fixed for the entire set. We cannot choose the matching arbitrarily for the entire set and then separately choose Vasya's pair? Actually, we can choose the matching arbitrarily (any bijection) and then choose any pair from the matching that satisfies the condition (total>=x) to be Vasya's.\n\n            So we are allowed to choose the entire matching and then choose which participant (which pair) is Vasya's.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Best place:\n\n              We want to minimize the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total.\n\n              To do that, we can:\n\n                Step 1: Assign the highest total (max_A + max_B) to Vasya.\n\n                Then, we want to assign the remaining numbers to the other participants in such a way that as few as possible participants have a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n                How to assign the rest? We want to minimize the number of participants with total > Vasya's.\n\n                Note: The rest of the participants must use the remaining n-1 elements of A and n-1 elements of B.\n\n                Then, the maximum total we can form from the remaining is (max_A without the one used for Vasya) + (max_B without the one used for Vasya). But wait, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can avoid having many high totals.\n\n                Actually, we can use a greedy strategy:\n\n                  Sort A in descending order, and B in descending order.\n\n                  Then, to minimize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's (let Vasya's total be T0), we can try to assign the remaining numbers so that as many participants as possible have a total <= T0.\n\n                  However, note: we are constrained by the matching.\n\n            Standard solution for similar problems (like Codeforces Round #383 (Div. 1) C) is:\n\n              Sort A and B in non-decreasing order.\n\n              Then, for best place:\n\n                We can use two pointers to count the maximum number of participants that can have total <= T0 (if we set Vasya's total to T0, then the rest should be assigned to have as few as possible > T0).\n\n                But let me recall:\n\n                  There is a known way to compute the best and worst ranks in contests when given two arrays.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n              Let F(s) be the minimum number of participants that must have total >= s (or something else). \n\n            Actually, a common solution for this problem (which is a known problem) is:\n\n              Sort A in increasing order, and B in increasing order.\n\n              Then, to compute the best place:\n\n                We want to assign the highest total to Vasya, so we take the largest element from A and the largest from B. Then, we want to know how many participants have total > (A_max+B_max). But wait, we cannot have two participants with the same two maximums. Actually, we have to consider the entire set.\n\n            After research, I recall that there is a standard solution:\n\n              Step 1: Sort the two arrays: \n                  A_sorted = sorted(A)   # ascending\n                  B_sorted = sorted(B)   # ascending\n\n              Then, to compute the best place:\n\n                We want to maximize Vasya's total, so we take the largest element from A and the largest from B. But then, we have to check how many participants can have a total greater than that. Actually, we are going to form the matching optimally for the rest.\n\n                Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                  Let Vasya's total = T = max_possible (which is A_max+B_max). Then, we remove one occurrence of A_max and one of B_max from the arrays, and then we want to form the rest of the matching (using the remaining n-1 elements of A and n-1 elements of B) and count the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) that have a total >= T? Actually, no: we want the number of participants with total > T.\n\n                But note: we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily, so we can avoid having any participant with total > T (unless there are duplicates). However, if there are duplicates, then we might have to assign the same maximums again.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                  Let T0 = max_A + max_B.\n\n                  Then, we remove the two maximums (one from A and one from B) and then form the rest of the matching arbitrarily. Then, the maximum total we can get from the remaining is (next_max_A + next_max_B). \n\n                However, we can also use a greedy matching to minimize the number of participants with total > T0.\n\n                But note: we are only concerned with the count of participants with total strictly greater than T0.\n\n                Since we removed the two maximums, the next highest total we can form is (max_A2 + max_B2) where A2 is the next biggest in A and B2 is the next biggest in B. But if A2 and B2 are the same as the ones we removed, then we have to consider multiple removals.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                  Count the number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total > T0. But note: we are allowed to choose which one is Vasya's. So we can choose Vasya's pair to be the maximum one, and then the rest of the pairs must be formed from the remaining numbers.\n\n                However, the matching must use the entire set. Therefore, the set of pairs we can form from the remaining n-1 elements is fixed.\n\n                Then, the number of participants with total > T0 is the number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total > T0, minus the fact that we removed one occurrence (the maximum one) and then we can avoid using the same maximum again.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                  Let's form a graph: we have two arrays and we can form a bipartite graph. Then, the maximum matching that uses the highest total for Vasya and then minimizes the count of pairs with total > T0 is complicated.\n\n            I found a known solution for this problem (it's a classic):\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Sort A in increasing order, and B in increasing order.\n\n              Then, to compute the best place:\n\n                We want to maximize Vasya's total. So we set Vasya's total to the maximum possible: T0 = A[-1] + B[-1]. Then, we remove the last element of A and the last element of B.\n\n                Then, we want to count the maximum number of participants (from the remaining) that can have a total greater than T0. Actually, no: we want to minimize the number of participants that have total > T0.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can try to break the matching so that no participant has total > T0. However, if there are multiple copies of the maximum values, then we cannot avoid.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                  Let i = n-1, j = n-1 (pointers for A and B, starting from the largest)\n\n                  Then, we traverse from the largest to smallest and count the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b > T0.\n\n                However, we are going to consider the entire set without the one we assigned to Vasya.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer method to count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) in the entire set (without removing any) that have total > T0, but then subtract the ones that are forced to be above T0 even after removing Vasya's.\n\n            Actually, a simpler approach:\n\n            We note that the best place is 1 (if there is at least one participant with total >= x, and we can assign Vasya to have the maximum total, then he is first). But wait, what if there are two participants with the same maximum total? Then the jury can assign the first place arbitrarily. But we can always assign Vasya to be the first.\n\n            However, the problem says: the jury can break ties arbitrarily. So if there are ties, we can choose to put Vasya first even if someone else has the same total.\n\n            Therefore, for best place:\n\n              We can always assign Vasya to have the maximum total, and then the number of participants with total strictly greater than him is 0, and then we can assign the rest arbitrarily. Then, his rank is 1 (if there is no one with a strictly greater total) OR if there are others with the same total, we can break the tie arbitrarily to give him the first place.\n\n            Therefore, the best place is always 1? \n\n            But wait: what if we cannot assign Vasya the maximum total? Actually, we can choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can always assign Vasya the pair (max_A, max_B). Then, the rest of the participants have totals that are at most (max_A without the max) + (max_B without the max) which is <= max_A + max_B (and if there are duplicates, then it might be equal). But note, if there are duplicates, then we might have more than one participant with total = max_A+max_B.\n\n            However, the problem says: the jury can break ties arbitrarily. So even if there are multiple participants with total >= x (and possibly equal to Vasya's total), we can assign Vasya the first place.\n\n            So the best place is always 1.\n\n            But wait: what if Vasya's total is not the maximum? Actually, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. We can assign the maximum total to Vasya. So yes, we can always make Vasya's total the maximum.\n\n            Therefore, the best place is 1.\n\n            Now, worst place:\n\n              We want to assign Vasya a total that is at least x, but as small as possible, and then we want to maximize the number of participants that have total >= Vasya's total.\n\n              Steps:\n\n                Step 1: Find the minimal total T_min such that T_min >= x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) that we can assign to Vasya and the rest matching is possible.\n\n                However, we are allowed to choose the entire matching. So we can choose the smallest total for Vasya that is at least x, but we must use the entire set.\n\n                Then, we want to count the maximum number of participants (including himself) that have total >= T_min. Then, his rank would be (number of participants with total >= T_min) [because the jury can break ties arbitrarily, so we can put everyone with >= T_min above him, but wait: no, we can choose the ordering arbitrarily. Actually, we want to maximize the number of participants that have total >= T_min (so that we are forced to put as many as possible above Vasya). Then, his rank is (count) (since the participants are sorted descending, the rank is the position: if there are k participants with total >= T_min, then Vasya is the last among them, so his rank is k).\n\n                However, note: we can choose which matching to use, and we can choose which pair is Vasya's. So:\n\n                  We want to choose a total T (>=x) and then assign the entire set such that the number of participants with total >= T is as large as possible (so that Vasya is pushed to a worse rank).\n\n                But note: we can also choose T arbitrarily from the set of achievable totals (by the matching) that are >= x. However, we are constrained by the two multisets.\n\n                How to compute the worst place?\n\n                  We can use:\n\n                    Sort A in ascending order, and B in ascending order.\n\n                    Then, we can consider: we want to find the minimal T (>=x) such that there exists a matching in which Vasya gets T and the rest are assigned arbitrarily. But actually, we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can choose the smallest T (>=x) that appears in the set of achievable totals.\n\n                    Then, we want to count the maximum number of participants that can have total >= T (over all matchings). But note: we are constrained by the entire set.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                  Let T be the minimal total >= x that Vasya can have. Then, we can also form a matching such that the set of totals is as large as possible (meaning, we want to maximize the count of participants with total >= T).\n\n                How to count the maximum number of participants with total >= T?\n\n                  We can use a greedy matching:\n\n                    Sort A and B in descending order.\n\n                    Then, we want to form as many pairs as possible (starting from the largest) that have total >= T.\n\n                    But note: we are not limited by T for the entire set, but we are counting the number of pairs (from the entire matching) that have total >= T.\n\n                Steps for worst place:\n\n                  Step 1: Find the minimal T (>=x) that can be achieved by one of the participants (in some matching) and that is at least x.\n\n                  However, we don't know T. We can iterate T from x to max(A)+max(B)? That's too slow.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                  We want to maximize the number of participants with total >= T, for T being the total we assign to Vasya (which must be >=x). But note: we can choose T arbitrarily (as long as there is a matching that assigns T to Vasya and the rest is valid). However, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                  We are going to count the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total >= x. But wait: we are forced to use all the elements. However, we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's, and we want to minimize Vasya's total (so we choose the smallest T>=x) and then we want to maximize the number of participants (including Vasya) that have total >= T.\n\n                But note: if we choose a small T, then there might be fewer participants with total >= T. However, we are trying to push Vasya to the worst rank, so we want as many participants as possible to have total >= T. Therefore, we should choose T as the smallest value such that there are as many pairs (including Vasya) with total >= T as possible.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                  Let f(T) = the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that can have total >= T (without fixing Vasya). Then, we want to choose T_min (minimal T>=x) such that f(T_min) is maximized? \n\n                But note: we are constrained by the fact that we must use each element once, and then we are forced to assign one of the pairs (the one we choose for Vasya) to be T_min.\n\n                This is complicated.\n\n            Known efficient solution:\n\n            Problem: Codeforces Round #383 (Div. 1) C and similar.\n\n            Actually, I recall a solution for the problem \"Olympiad\" from Codeforces:\n\n              #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n              using namespace std;\n\n              int main() {\n                  int n;\n                  long long x;\n                  cin >> n >> x;\n                  vector<int> a(n), b(n);\n                  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                      cin >> a[i];\n                  }\n                  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                      cin >> b[i];\n                  }\n\n                  sort(a.begin(), a.end());\n                  sort(b.begin(), b.end());\n\n                  // Best place: always 1? \n                  // Worst place: ?\n\n                  // But wait, the sample: \n                  // Input: \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n                  // Output: \"1 5\"\n\n                  // In the sample, best is 1, worst is 5.\n\n                  // Another sample: \"6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4\" -> \"1 5\"\n\n                  // How to compute worst place?\n\n                  // We can use a greedy matching for the entire set and then count the number of participants with total >= x.\n\n                  // But note: we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily.\n\n                  // Steps for worst place:\n\n                  //  1.

Actually, no: the ranking is by total, and if Vasya has the minimal total (x) and there are k participants with total >= x, then Vasya's rank is k (if there are k-1 participants with total > x, then the jury can put the k-1 above and then Vasya is last among the top k).\n\n                  // But wait: the problem says the total results' table sorts by sum (descending).

But the problem says: the jury can break ties arbitrarily. So they can assign the first place arbitrarily. However, the rank is defined by the number of distinct totals? No, the rank is the position: if there are k participants with total >= x, then Vasya's rank is at least k (if we break ties to put him last) and at most k (if there are ties, but the problem doesn't specify). \n\n                  // Actually, the problem says: \"the best and the worst place\".

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given scores from both tours to find the optimal pairing that maximizes and minimizes Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider all participants' scores from two tours and determine Vasya's best and worst possible ranks. Vasya's rank is determined by his total points (sum of scores from both tours) compared to others. The jury can break ties arbitrarily, so we can assume Vasya can be ranked highest or lowest among those with the same total points.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - **Best Place**: To achieve the best rank (1), Vasya should have the highest possible total score. This is always possible by selecting the maximum scores from both tours.\n   - **Worst Place**: To achieve the worst rank, Vasya should have the minimal total score that meets or exceeds the given threshold `x`. The rank is then determined by the number of participants who could have a higher or equal total score under the best possible matching for the other participants.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both sets of scores (from the two tours) are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to count the number of valid pairs (participants) that meet or exceed a certain total score, which helps in determining the worst-case scenario.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - Sorting both arrays takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The two-pointer technique for counting valid pairs operates in O(n) time per query, but since we process the sorted arrays once, the overall complexity remains O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Best place is always 1 because Vasya can take the highest score from each tour.\n    best_place = 1\n    \n    # Worst place calculation\n    total_available = n\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    count_needed = 0\n    \n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n        if s < x:\n            j -= 1\n            continue\n            \n        count_needed += 1\n        i -= 1\n        j -= 1\n        \n    worst_place = count_needed + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total points `x`, and the scores from the two tours (`a` and `b`).\n2. **Sorting**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted to facilitate the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Place Calculation**: The best rank is always 1 because Vasya can be assigned the highest scores from both tours.\n4. **Worst Place Calculation**: Using a two-pointer approach, we count how many participants can have a total score of at least `x` when paired optimally. The worst rank is then `count_needed + 1` because Vasya's rank is one worse than the count of participants who could outscore him.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and a two-pointer technique to determine the optimal ranks for Vasya, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.",
