And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me recalc: the problem says \"average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\"\n\n But note: the example input has two weeks, so we are to compute the average of the two week averages?\n Actually, no: the example does not say that. Let me read the example again:\n\n \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n Wait, the example output is 9.0000000000. How?\n\n They are actually computing: \n   total_sleep = (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18\n   number of weeks = 2\n   But wait, then the average per week is 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n However, note that in the example, they are considering the entire week's average as part of the overall average?\n Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n So, the overall average is the total amount of sleep in all the weeks divided by the total number of weeks?\n\n But wait, let's break down:\n\n There are (n-k+1) weeks. Each week has k days. However, note that the entire set of weeks uses some days multiple times.\n\n Actually, the total sleep time summed over all weeks is:\n   week1: a1 + a2 + ... + ak\n   week2: a2 + a3 + ... + ak+1\n   ...\n   week_{n-k+1}: a_{n-k+1} + ... + an\n\n So the total sleep time is the sum of all these.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum to quickly get the sum for any consecutive k days.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n   2. Compute the prefix sum array for the list.\n   3. The total sleep time is the sum over all windows of length k.\n\n However, note: the example with [3,4,7] and k=2:\n   prefix = [0, 3, 7, 11]\n   window1: prefix[1] - prefix[0] = 3, but wait we need from index0 to index1 (k=2): prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 -> but that is the whole array? \n\n Let me define prefix[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1}. Then the sum for window starting at i (0-indexed) is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n But note: our list is 0-indexed. We have n elements.\n\n Example: \n   n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n   prefix[0]=0\n   prefix[1]=3\n   prefix[2]=3+4=7\n   prefix[3]=3+4+7=11\n\n   Then the two windows:\n      window0: from index0 to index1 (two elements) -> prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7 -> but wait, 3+4=7, correct.\n      window1: from index1 to index2 -> prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 11-3=8 -> but wait, 4+7=11? Actually, no: 11-3=8, which is 4+7=11? That doesn't add up.\n\n Correction: the window from index1 to index2 should be the next two? But we only have two elements from index1 to index2 (which are two: 4 and 7). The prefix array is cumulative from the beginning.\n\n Actually, the window starting at index i (0-indexed) covers indices i to i+k-1. Then the sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n For window0 (i=0): prefix[0+2] - prefix[0] = prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7 -> correct.\n For window1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous subarray of length k days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all such weeks and then determining the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of n days where each week is a contiguous block of k days. The total number of weeks is (n - k + 1). For each week, we sum the sleep times of its k days. The final result is the average of these weekly sums across all weeks.\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is recognizing that the sum of sleep times for all weeks can be computed using a prefix sum array. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray of length k by leveraging the prefix sums.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the original array. This enables O(1) sum calculations for any subarray.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves:\n   - Reading the input values: O(n)\n   - Building the prefix sum array: O(n)\n   - Calculating the total sleep time for all weeks: O(n - k + 1)\n   - Computing the average: O(1)\n   The overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep = 0.0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        start_index = i\n        end_index = i + k\n        window_sum = prefix[end_index] - prefix[start_index]\n        total_sleep += window_sum\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of days) and k (length of a week), followed by a list of n integers representing sleep times.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If k is 0 (though constraints ensure k ≥ 1), the average is trivially 0.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index i holds the sum of the first i elements of the sleep time list. This allows efficient range sum queries.\n4. **Total Sleep Calculation**: For each week (contiguous subarray of length k), compute its sum using the prefix array and accumulate these sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total accumulated sleep time by the number of weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages prefix sums to handle the potentially large input size within feasible time complexity.",
