His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour points (a) and the second tour points (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that ai + bj >= x\", meaning Vasya's score is at least x.\n\n However, note: the problem states that there are no names, so we have to consider all participants. The catch is that we don't know which participant's first tour point corresponds to which second tour point. But wait: actually, the input gives two lists: one for the first tour and one for the second tour. The same participant appears once in the first list and once in the second list? Actually, no: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", and \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". So there are n participants, each having a first tour score and a second tour score.\n\n However, the input gives two separate lists: the first line of the second part is the first tour scores for all participants (in arbitrary order), and the third line is the second tour scores for all participants (in arbitrary order). But note: the problem does not say that the same index corresponds to the same participant. In fact, we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\", meaning we are free to match any first tour score with any second tour score to form a participant's total.\n\n However, note: the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the results have no names. So we are told the multiset of first tour scores and the multiset of second tour scores.\n\n Now, we know that Vasya has a total score of at least x. But we don't know his exact scores. However, we are allowed to choose which scores are his? Actually, no: the problem says that there are two integers i, j such that the first tour score a_i and the second tour score b_j (from the two given lists) form Vasya's total. But note: the entire set of participants is fixed, and we must assign the other scores to the other participants.\n\n However, the problem does not require knowing Vasya's exact scores, but what are the best and worst place he could have gotten?\n\n How to approach:\n\n We are going to consider that we can assign the first and second tour scores arbitrarily to the n participants. But note: the same score from the first list must be assigned to one participant and the same from the second list to another? Actually, no: the problem says the participants are given by two lists, meaning that the first list is the first tour scores and the second list is the second tour scores. And we have n participants, each having one first tour score and one second tour score.\n\n But we are free to pair the first tour scores with the second tour scores arbitrarily. However, we must account for the fact that we know Vasya has at least x points. So there must be at least one pair (from the given multisets) that sums to at least x that is assigned to Vasya. But wait, actually, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\". This means that we can choose any pairing that includes at least one pair (for Vasya) that meets the condition.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the other participants' scores are known. Actually, we are told the two multisets. So we can reassign arbitrarily.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to compute the total score for each participant if we pair the first and second tour arbitrarily. But we cannot try all n! pairings.\n\n 2. We are interested in the best and worst place Vasya can get.\n\n Observation:\n\n - Best place: we want as few participants as possible having a higher total than Vasya. We can choose Vasya's two scores arbitrarily from the two lists (as long as they sum to at least x). Then, we can assign the remaining scores arbitrarily to the other participants.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix which scores are Vasya's. However, we are guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. So we can choose that pair for Vasya.\n\n However, the catch is: we can also choose which pair to assign to Vasya? Actually, the problem states: \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"Vasya was present\". But the problem doesn't say that we can arbitrarily change the assignment of the two lists. Actually, the two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on the given scores from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total score is at least `x`, and we can strategically pair the first and second tour scores to minimize or maximize his rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers representing scores from the first and second tours.\n   - Vasya's total score (sum of his first and second tour scores) must be at least `x`.\n   - The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) possible ranks Vasya can achieve by optimally pairing the scores.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Place**: To achieve the best rank, we should maximize Vasya's score by pairing his highest possible scores with others' lower scores. This minimizes the number of participants with higher total scores.\n   - **Worst Place**: To achieve the worst rank, we should minimize Vasya's score (just meeting `x`) while maximizing others' scores. This maximizes the number of participants with higher total scores.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted in descending order to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For the best place, we use two pointers to count how many participants can have a total score higher than Vasya's maximum possible score. For the worst place, we similarly count participants who can have a higher score than Vasya's minimum required score.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The two-pointer traversal is O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a.sort(reverse=True)\n    b.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    total_needed_best = 0\n    total_needed_worst = x\n    \n    # Best case scenario: Vasya has the highest possible total score.\n    # Count how many participants can have a total score greater than Vasya's best possible total.\n    i = j = 0\n    best_place = 1\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a[i] + b[j] > total_needed_best:\n            best_place += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Worst case scenario: Vasya has the minimum required total score (x).\n    # Count how many participants can have a total score greater than x.\n    i = j = 0\n    worst_place = 1\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a[i] + b[j] > x:\n            worst_place += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the two lists of scores for the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted in descending order to facilitate efficient pairing.\n3. **Best Place Calculation**: Using two pointers, we count how many participants can have a total score higher than Vasya's best possible score (sum of the highest scores from both lists). The best place is then determined by this count.\n4. **Worst Place Calculation**: Similarly, using two pointers, we count how many participants can have a total score higher than `x` (Vasya's minimum required score). The worst place is derived from this count.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst places are printed as two space-separated integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and two-pointer techniques to determine the optimal and pessimistic rankings Vasya could achieve, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.",
