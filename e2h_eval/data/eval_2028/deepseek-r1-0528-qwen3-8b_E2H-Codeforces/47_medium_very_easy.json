    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (with 1 <= a,b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b (if a < b then d is negative, but we can assume without loss of generality that we set x = a+k and y = b+k, then note that |x-y| = |a-b| is fixed.\n\nWe have:\n  Let g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then note that g divides (a-b) as well (because (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b). So g must be a divisor of |a-b|.\n\nBut note: if a == b, then for any k, the numbers are equal. Then we want the LCM of (a+k) and (a+k) which is a+k. To minimize a+k, we take k=0. However, the problem says \"smallest non-negative integer k\", and in the example [5,10] the answer is 0, but note that 5 != 10 so we cannot assume a==b? Actually, the example input includes [5,10] -> output 0.\n\nWait, let's check the example: \n  Input: 5 10 -> Output: 0\n  Then we have LCM(5,10)=10.\n\nBut note: if k=0, then LCM(5,10)=10.\nIf k=1, then LCM(6,11)=66.\nk=2: LCM(7,12)=84.\nk=3: LCM(8,13)=104.\nk=4: LCM(9,14)=126.\nk=5: LCM(10,15)=30 -> wait, that is smaller than 10? No, wait: 30 is greater than 10? Actually no, 10 is the smallest.\n\nBut wait, the example says output is 0. So why is 0 the answer? Because at k=0, LCM=10, and at k=5, LCM=30 which is larger. So 0 is the best.\n\nHowever, consider another example: [6,10] -> k=2 gives LCM(8,12)=24. What about k=0: LCM(6,10)=30, k=1: LCM(7,11)=77, k=2:24, k=3: LCM(9,13)=117, k=4: LCM(10,14)=70, k=5: LCM(11,15)=165, etc. So indeed k=2 is best.\n\nHow do we solve it?\n\nNote: \n  LCM(x,y) = (x * y) / GCD(x,y)\n\nBut note: x = a+k, y = b+k.\n\nAlso, note that the difference between x and y is fixed: |x-y| = |a-b|. Let D = |a-b|.\n\nThen, let g = gcd(x,y). Then g divides D (because g divides (a+k) and (b+k) and hence their difference D). Therefore, g must be a divisor of D.\n\nNow, we can also write:\n  x = g * x', y = g * y', and then gcd(x',y')=1.\n  Then LCM(x,y) = g * x' * y' = g * (x/g) * (y/g) = (x*y)/g.\n\nBut note: the product x*y = (a+k)*(b+k) is not linear. However, we can relate k to the divisors.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation for k: \n  We require that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). Since g divides (a-b), we can express k modulo g? \n\nActually, we have:\n  (a+k) mod g = 0   => k ≡ (-a) mod g\n  (b+k) mod g = 0   => k ≡ (-b) mod g\n\nBut note: since g divides (a-b), then (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g? \n  Because (a-b) is divisible by g, so a ≡ b (mod g). Then -a ≡ -b (mod g). So the two congruences are the same.\n\nTherefore, for a fixed divisor g of D (where D = |a-b|), the condition is that k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k = t*g - a (for some integer t) but we require k>=0 and we want to minimize the LCM.\n\nBut note: there might be multiple k for each divisor? Actually, we are looking for the minimal LCM. How can we iterate over k? The range of k is from 0 to ... but k can be very large (since a and b up to 10^9). We cannot iterate over all k.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe know that the LCM is minimized when the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized and/or the gcd is maximized? But note: LCM = (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k, b+k). To minimize the LCM, we can try to maximize the gcd (because then the denominator is large) but also the product might change.\n\nBut note: the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k if k is large enough (since both a+k and b+k are increasing). However, the gcd might increase and then decrease? Not necessarily.\n\nBut note: the gcd must divide D. So we can consider only divisors of D. And then for each divisor g (positive divisor) of D, we can find the smallest k >=0 such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then compute the LCM for that k and compare.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. If a == b, then the answer is 0 (because k=0: LCM(a, a)=a, and for k>0, LCM(a+k,a+k)=a+k > a).\n\n2. Otherwise, let D = abs(a-b). Then we consider all positive divisors of D.\n\n3. For each divisor g (which divides D), we can set:\n      k0 = (-a) % g   [but we want k0 to be the smallest non-negative solution to k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k0 = (g - a % g) % g]\n\n   However, note: if a % g == 0, then k0 = 0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g). But wait, we require that g divides (a+k). Then k0 is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k). Similarly, because g divides D, then automatically g divides (b+k) if and only if g divides (a+k) (because (a+k) - (b+k) = D, and if g divides both then it divides D, but here we are fixing g and requiring g divides (a+k) and then (b+k) = (a+k) - D, and since g divides D and a+k, then it divides (a+k)-D).\n\n   But note: if we set k = k0, then (a+k0) is divisible by g, and then (b+k0) = (a+k0) - D, and since g divides D and (a+k0), then g divides (b+k0). So yes.\n\n4. Then, for each divisor g, we get a candidate k = k0 (the smallest non-negative k that satisfies the condition for this divisor). Then we can compute:\n      x = a + k0\n      y = b + k0\n      current_gcd = gcd(x, y)   [note: but we know that g divides both, but the actual gcd might be larger? Actually, the gcd must be at least g, but it could be more? However, we are iterating over divisors of D, and the gcd must divide D. But note: the actual gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) might be a multiple of g? \n\nWait, let me clarify: \n  We are iterating over divisors g of D. Then we set k0 = (g - a % g) % g. Then (a+k0) is divisible by g, and (b+k0) is divisible by g. But the actual gcd may be a divisor of D that is a multiple of g? Or not necessarily.\n\nActually, the gcd must divide D, but it does not necessarily have to be one of the divisors we are considering? However, note that the gcd is a divisor of D, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut wait: the condition for k is that the gcd of (a+k, b+k) must be a divisor of D. So we are going to consider every divisor. However, note: the candidate k0 we get for a divisor g might be the same k for multiple divisors? And also, the actual gcd for that k might be larger than g. \n\nBut note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we will eventually consider the actual gcd (which is a divisor of D) and then we will get the same k or a different k? \n\nActually, the candidate k for divisor g is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k). But note: if the actual gcd is h (a divisor of D) and h is a multiple of g, then the condition for h would give a k0' which is the smallest non-negative k such that h divides (a+k). This k0' might be less than k0 (if g is not the full divisor) or not? \n\nBut note: the condition for h (which is a divisor of D) requires k ≡ (-a) mod h. Since h is a multiple of g, then k0 (from g) might not satisfy the condition for h. \n\nHowever, note: if g is a divisor of h (if we are going to consider divisors in increasing order, we might miss something). Actually, we should consider all divisors. \n\nBut note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So we must consider all divisors and then for each divisor we get a candidate k. Then we compute the LCM for that candidate k (with the actual gcd, which we can compute by math.gcd) and then choose the candidate k that gives the smallest LCM.\n\nBut wait: what if the actual gcd is h (a divisor of D) and h is not the divisor we started with? Then we are going to consider h separately and get a candidate k0_h. Then we will compute the LCM for k0_h. But note: the candidate k0_g (from divisor g) might lead to an actual gcd of h (which is a multiple of g) and then the LCM for k0_g might be the same as for k0_h? \n\nActually, no: because if we use k0_g, then the gcd is at least g, but we don't know if it is exactly g or more. However, we are computing the LCM for the candidate k0_g by using the actual gcd (via math.gcd). So even if we use a divisor g that is not the actual gcd, we still compute the correct LCM for that k0_g.\n\nBut note: the candidate k0_g might not be the only k for which the gcd is at least g. However, we are required to find the k that minimizes the LCM. We are considering one candidate per divisor. \n\nBut is it sufficient to consider only the divisors of D? \n\nYes, because the gcd must divide D, and for any k, the gcd is a divisor of D. Therefore, the minimal LCM must occur at one of these candidate k's (the smallest k for each divisor). However, note: there might be other k's that are not the minimal k for any divisor? \n\nBut note: if k is a solution for some divisor g, then the gcd is at least g. But the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k,b+k). Since the gcd is at least g, then the LCM is at most (a+k)*(b+k)/g. However, we are trying to minimize the LCM. \n\nBut here's the catch: the minimal k for a divisor g might lead to a high product (a+k)*(b+k) if k is large. However, we are only considering one k per divisor (the minimal k). But note: for a fixed divisor g, the next k that satisfies the condition is k0 + t*g (for t>=0). It might be that for a larger t, the product (a+k)*(b+k) is smaller? \n\nWait, no: the product is increasing with k (because both a+k and b+k are increasing). So the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for g, and for that k the product is minimal for that divisor.\n\nBut note: we are minimizing the LCM, and the LCM for a fixed divisor g is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd_value, and the gcd_value might be higher than g (if the actual gcd is a multiple of g). However, we don't know the actual gcd until we compute it. But we are iterating over all divisors, so we are going to consider the divisor that is the actual gcd (if we use the actual gcd, we get the candidate k0 for that divisor, and then the LCM is computed correctly). \n\nBut wait: for a divisor g, we are only guaranteed that the gcd is divisible by g. However, the actual gcd might be a multiple of g. Then the same k0 might be obtained from a divisor h (a multiple of g) and we will compute the LCM with the actual gcd (which is h) and get a better value. But we are going to consider h separately and then k0_h might be different from k0_g.\n\nActually, the minimal k for divisor h (which is a multiple of g) is the smallest k such that k ≡ (-a) mod h. Since h is a multiple of g, then the condition for h is stronger. The minimal k for h is the same as the minimal k for g? Not necessarily.\n\nExample: a=6, b=10, D=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1)%1 -> 0. Then k=0, LCM(6,10)=30.\nFor g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2 = 0. Then k=0 again? Wait, 6%2=0, so k0=0. Then k=0, but then the gcd(6,10)=2, so we actually use g=2 for k=0. Then LCM= (6*10)/2 = 30.\n\nBut then for g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then k=2, then LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nSo we found the candidate k=2 from divisor 4.\n\nBut note: k0 for divisor 2 was 0, and that candidate k=0 gave LCM=30. Then we consider divisor 4 and get k=2 which gives LCM=24. So we must consider all divisors.\n\nBut how do we handle the case when a and b are very large? The number of divisors of D is O(sqrt(D)), which is acceptable because D up to 10^9 has at most around 1300 divisors.\n\nHowever, note: we must consider that the divisors of D are the divisors of |a-b|. But if a==b, then D=0, and we already handled that.\n\nBut what if D=0? Then we skip the divisor loop and output 0.\n\nBut note: the example [5,10] -> D=5, divisors: 1,5.\n\nFor divisor 1: k0 = (1-5%1)%1 = 0. Then k=0: numbers 5,10 -> gcd=5, LCM= (5*10)/5=10.\n\nFor divisor 5: k0 = (5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0. Then k=0 again.\n\nBut wait, the example says output 0. So we have two candidates: k=0 from divisor1 and divisor5. Then we compute the LCM for k=0 and it's 10.\n\nBut then, is there a k that yields a lower LCM? We must check: k=0:10, k=1: LCM(6,11)=66, k=2:84, etc. So 10 is the minimum.\n\nBut wait: the example [5,10] is provided and the output is 0.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, he needs to choose the smallest one.\" In the case of [5,10], k=0 is the smallest and the LCM is 10, and no k gives a lower LCM.\n\nBut note: the divisor 1 and divisor5 both give k0=0. So we must avoid duplicate k's? Actually, we are going to consider the same k multiple times. Then we must make sure we don't compute the same k multiple times unnecessarily, but it's okay because we are just storing the best LCM and the smallest k.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over divisors. The candidate k0 for a divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for that divisor. However, it is possible that the same k satisfies the condition for multiple divisors.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  candidates = {}   # mapping from k to LCM? Or we can just store (k, lcm) and then choose the minimal LCM and then the smallest k.\n\nBut note: we are only interested in the minimal LCM and then the smallest k. However, we must compute the LCM for each candidate k. But note: the same k might appear from different divisors, then we can avoid recalculating the same k.\n\nBut wait: we are iterating over divisors and each divisor gives one candidate k. There might be duplicates. We can use a set for k's we have already considered.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: D up to 10^9, so the divisors are about 1300. Then the distinct k's we get are at most 1300. So we can store the k's we've seen.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each divisor and then update the best candidate.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Read a, b.\n\n  If a == b: print(0); return.\n\n  Let D = abs(a-b)\n\n  Find all divisors of D.\n\n  Initialize:\n      best_k = None\n      best_lcm = None\n\n  For each divisor g in divisors (including D itself and 1):\n\n      k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k0) % g == 0]\n\n      But note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g)\n\n      Then, we have candidate k = k0.\n\n      However, we must ensure that k0 is the smallest non-negative. The formula above does that.\n\n      But note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0, else k0 = g - (a % g). This is standard.\n\n      Now, if we have already considered k0, we can skip? Or not, because the same k0 might come from multiple divisors and we want to compute the LCM only once. But we can use a set to record k's we've processed.\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid duplicate k's by using a set.\n\n  But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. Then we compute the LCM for that k0 only once.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let k_set = set()\n\n      For each divisor g (we consider positive divisors):\n\n          k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [this is the minimal k for divisor g]\n\n          If k0 is already in k_set, skip.\n\n          Else, add k0 to k_set.\n\n          Then compute x = a + k0, y = b + k0.\n\n          Then compute g_val = gcd(x, y)   [using math.gcd]\n\n          Then lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n          Then compare with the best_lcm.\n\n      Then, after iterating, we have the candidate k0 that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple k0's give the same LCM, we choose the smallest k0.\n\n  However, wait: we are iterating over divisors and we are generating candidate k0's. But note: the minimal k0 for a divisor g might not be the minimal k overall? \n\n  But note: the condition for the divisor g requires k0 to be the smallest k that makes (a+k0) divisible by g. But the overall minimal k that minimizes the LCM might be a k that doesn't necessarily satisfy the condition for the divisor that is the actual gcd? \n\n  However, we are iterating over all divisors (which are the possible gcds). And the LCM for a candidate k is determined by the actual gcd (which is a divisor of D). Therefore, we must consider all divisors. But note: the candidate k0 for a divisor g might not be the k that minimizes the LCM for the entire problem. \n\n  But wait, the above reasoning: the minimal k for each divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for g. However, the LCM at k0 might be large because the product (a+k0)*(b+k0) is large, even though the gcd is large. \n\n  Example: a=6, b=10, D=4. \n      divisor 1: k0=0, LCM= (6*10)//gcd(6,10)=60//2=30.\n      divisor 2: k0=0, same as above -> skip if duplicate.\n      divisor 4: k0= (4 - 6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2, then LCM(8,12)= (8*12)//4=96//4=24.\n\n  Then we found a candidate with LCM=24, which is better than 30. So we must consider.\n\n  But note: there might be a k that is not the minimal k for any divisor (i.e., not satisfying any divisor condition) but still the LCM is lower? \n\n  However, the gcd must divide D, so the condition for k must be that the gcd divides D. And the gcd condition is equivalent to k being congruent to (-a) mod g for some divisor g. Therefore, the minimal k must be one of these k0's (or a multiple of the modulus? but we are taking the minimal k). \n\n  Actually, the set of k that satisfy the condition for at least one divisor (i.e., the gcd divides D) is the set of k that are congruent to (-a) mod g for some divisor g. But note: the condition for k is that the gcd divides D, but the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it must be one of the divisors. Therefore, the candidate k must be one of the k0's (the minimal k for each divisor). However, note: k0 is the minimal k for divisor g, but there might be a k that is not the minimal for any divisor but is minimal overall? \n\n  But wait, the set of k that work for divisor g is { k0 + t*g : t>=0 }. Then the overall set of k that work is the union of these sets for all divisors g. Therefore, the minimal k overall (the smallest k) that minimizes the LCM must be one of the k0's (the minimal k for each divisor) or a k that is in one of the arithmetic progressions but is not the minimal for that divisor? \n\n  Actually, we are looking for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. The LCM is a function of k, and we are only concerned with the minimal LCM. However, note that the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k (because both a+k and b+k are increasing). Therefore, for a fixed divisor g, the minimal k (k0) gives the smallest product (a+k)*(b+k) for that divisor. But the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k,b+k). The gcd(a+k,b+k) might be larger than g (if k0 happens to make the gcd larger). \n\n  However, note: the gcd(a+k,b+k) is the same as the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) for that k0, and it must be a divisor of D. Then the LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0)/gcd_value. \n\n  But is it possible that a larger k (from the same divisor g) might yield a lower LCM? \n\n  Consider: For divisor g, we have k0, k0+g, k0+2g, etc.\n\n  At k0: LCM0 = (a+k0)*(b+k0)/gcd0, where gcd0 = gcd(a+k0, b+k0) [which is at least g].\n\n  At k0+g: \n        x' = a+k0+g, y'=b+k0+g.\n        Note: g divides (a+k0) and (b+k0), so it divides x' and y'. But the gcd(x', y') might be different.\n\n  The product (a+k0+g)*(b+k0+g) is larger than (a+k0)*(b+k0) (because both factors increased). And the gcd might be the same or larger. But the LCM is product divided by gcd. Since the product is larger, unless the gcd increases a lot, the LCM might be larger.\n\n  However, it is not obvious. But note: the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the divisibility condition for g. And the product is minimized at k0. But the LCM might be minimized at a larger k for the same divisor? \n\n  Example: Let a=1, b=3, D=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n  For divisor 1: k0= (1-1%1)%1=0 -> k=0: LCM(1,3)=3.\n  For divisor 2: k0= (2-1%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> k=1: LCM(2,4)=4.\n\n  But wait, what about k=0: LCM=3, k=1: LCM=4. So the minimal LCM is 3 at k=0.\n\n  Now, what if we consider k=2 (from divisor2: k0=1, then next is 3)? \n        k=2: LCM(3,5)=15 -> worse.\n\n  But consider another example: a=2, b=4, D=2. Divisors:1,2.\n\n  divisor1: k0= (1-2%1)%1 -> 0. Then k=0: LCM(2,4)=4.\n  divisor2: k0= (2-2%2)%2=0. Then k=0: same as above, LCM=4.\n\n  Then k=0 is the minimal k. But what if we consider k=2 (from divisor2: k0=0, then next is 2)? \n        k=2: LCM(4,6)=12 -> worse.\n\n  Another example: a=3, b=5, D=2.\n\n  divisor1: k0= (1-3%1)%1=0 -> LCM(3,5)=15.\n  divisor2: k0= (2-3%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> k=1: LCM(4,6)=12.\n\n  Now, is there a k=2? \n        k=2: LCM(5,7)=35 -> worse.\n\n  But wait, what if we take divisor 1 and then k=1 (which is not the minimal for divisor1, but from divisor1 we have k0=0, then the next is 1)? \n        k=1: LCM(4,6)=12 -> same as divisor2's candidate.\n\n  But note: the divisor2 gives k0=1, and divisor1 gives k0=0. Then we also have to consider the next k for divisor1? \n\n  However, our method only considers the minimal k for each divisor. But k=1 is the minimal k for divisor2, and k=0 is the minimal for divisor1. Then we did not consider k=1 from divisor1? \n\n  But wait, k=1 is not the minimal k for divisor1: the minimal k for divisor1 is 0. But we did not consider k=1 for divisor1. \n\n  However, note: the condition for divisor1 is that k ≡ (-3) mod 1. But mod1: every k is congruent to 0 mod1? Actually, (-3) mod1 is 0. So the minimal k is 0. Then the next k is 1, then 2, etc.\n\n  But we are only considering the minimal k per divisor. \n\n  Why is k=1 giving the same LCM as divisor2? That means we might miss a candidate k that is not the minimal for its divisor but is the minimal for a different divisor? \n\n  Actually, no: because divisor2's minimal k is 1, so we do consider k=1.\n\n  But wait: the problem is that we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. However, the minimal k for divisor1 is 0, and the minimal k for divisor2 is 1. Then we consider k=0 and k=1.\n\n  Then we don't consider k=1 for divisor1? That is okay because we are only concerned with the minimal k that satisfies the condition for the divisor. But note: the condition for divisor1 is satisfied by k=0,1,2,... and the condition for divisor2 is satisfied by k=1,3,5,... \n\n  Therefore, we must consider all k that are the minimal k for at least one divisor. \n\n  But note: the minimal k for divisor2 is 1, and that k=1 is not the minimal for divisor1, so we are not missing it.\n\n  However, consider: what if the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but then the LCM at k0 is high, but at k0+g (the next one) the LCM becomes lower? \n\n  Example: a=4, b=6, D=2.\n\n  Divisors: 1,2.\n\n  divisor1: k0=0 -> LCM(4,6)=12.\n  divisor2: k0= (2-4%2)%2=0 -> same k0=0, so we skip.\n\n  Then we only consider k=0. But what about k=2? \n        k=2: LCM(6,8)=24 -> worse.\n\n  Another example: a=8, b=12, D=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n  divisor1: k0=0 -> LCM(8,12)=24.\n  divisor2: k0= (2-8%2)%2=0 -> same, skip.\n  divisor4: k0= (4-8%4)%4=0 -> same, skip.\n\n  Then we only consider k=0. But what about k=4?\n        k=4: LCM(12,16)=48 -> worse.\n\n  But wait, is there a k that is not 0? \n\n  Consider divisor4: k0=0, but the next k is 4. Then k=4: \n        x=12, y=16 -> gcd(12,16)=4, LCM= (12*16)//4=48.\n\n  But wait, what if we consider divisor 1 and divisor2 and divisor4? We only got k=0.\n\n  But note: divisor1: k0=0, divisor2: k0=0, divisor4: k0=0. \n\n  However, note: the minimal k for divisor4 is 0? \n        Condition: 8+k divisible by 4 -> 8+k mod4=0. 8 mod4=0, so k0=0.\n\n  So no, k=4 is not the minimal for divisor4, but we are not considering it.\n\n  But is k=4 a candidate? \n\n  Actually, k=4 is the minimal k for divisor4? No, the minimal k for divisor4 is 0. Then the next k is 4. \n\n  But the problem: we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. Then we are missing the possibility that a larger k (like 4) might yield a lower LCM? \n\n  However, the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k, and the gcd might be increasing as well, but the LCM is product/gcd. \n\n  In the example above, at k=0: LCM=24, at k=4: LCM=48 -> worse.\n\n  But consider: a=5, b=10, D=5. Divisors:1,5.\n\n  divisor1: k0=0 -> LCM(5,10)=10.\n  divisor5: k0= (5-5%5)%5=0 -> same.\n\n  Then k=0 is the only candidate.\n\n  But what if we take k=5? \n        LCM(10,15)=30 -> worse.\n\n  So it seems that the minimal k for each divisor gives the minimal product (and hence the minimal LCM) for that divisor.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the actual gcd for k0 might be larger than g (the divisor we are using). Then the LCM might be lower than we thought. \n\n  Example: a=6, b=10, D=4. \n      divisor1: k0=0 -> LCM= (6*10)//2=30.\n      divisor2: k0=0 -> same.\n      divisor4: k0=2 -> LCM= (8*12)//4=24.\n\n  Now, consider divisor4: the minimal k is 2. But what if we consider divisor4's next k: 2+4=6?\n        k=6: LCM(12,16)=48 -> worse.\n\n  But note: the actual gcd at k=0 was 2, which is larger than the divisor1 (which is 1) but we considered divisor1 and divisor2 and divisor4.\n\n  So the key is: we must consider all divisors, and for each divisor we take the minimal k that satisfies the condition for that divisor.\n\n  But note: the condition for divisor g is that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then the minimal k is k0. \n\n  However, we must also consider k=0 when D=0 (which we already handled). \n\n  But wait: what if a and b are negative? The problem states that a,b>=1.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n  However, there is one more thing: the divisor set must include negative divisors? No, because gcd is positive, and divisors are positive.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      import math\n\n      Read a, b.\n\n      if a == b:\n          print(0)\n          exit()\n\n      D = abs(a-b)\n\n      Find all divisors of D.\n\n      best_k = 0\n      best_lcm = float('inf')\n\n      But note: we are to choose the smallest k in case of ties in LCM, so we must store the LCM and k.\n\n      Let candidates = {}  # we don't need to store all, we can compare as we go.\n\n      However, we are iterating over divisors. We can do:\n\n        k_set = set()\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            if k0 == 0 and a % g == 0:  # then k0=0, but if a%g==0 then we know, but the formula works anyway.\n            # But note: if a % g == 0, then (a % g)==0, then k0 = (g-0)%g = 0.\n\n            if k0 in k_set:\n                continue\n            k_set.add(k0)\n\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n            # But note: the product x*y might be very large (a,b up to 10^9, then x and y up to 2e9, so product 4e18, which is acceptable in Python but we must be cautious for performance? The gcd computation is efficient.\n\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                # But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is fixed as \\( |a - b| \\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of this difference. Therefore, we can consider all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) to determine potential values of \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\) is given by \\( k = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\). This \\( k \\) ensures that \\( g \\) divides both numbers, which helps in reducing the LCM.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself.\n   - For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that satisfies the divisibility condition.\n   - Calculate the LCM for each candidate \\( k \\) and keep track of the minimal LCM encountered, choosing the smallest \\( k \\) in case of ties.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) is \\( O(\\sqrt{D}) \\), where \\( D = |a - b| \\). For \\( D \\) up to \\( 10^9 \\), this results in around 1300 divisors, making the approach efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport sys\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1]\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n    return sorted(list(divisors))\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    D = abs(a - b)\n    divisors_list = get_divisors(D)\n    seen_k = set()\n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for g in divisors_list:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n            \n        if k0 in seen_k:\n            continue\n        seen_k.add(k0)\n        \n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n        \n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is \\( 0 \\) because the LCM of two identical numbers is minimized at \\( k = 0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) using a helper function `get_divisors`.\n4. **Finding Minimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\).
