For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, k, f.\n\n The problem is about assigning a value c_s (from 0 to k) for every binary string s of length from 1 to n.\n Then, the condition is that the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly f.\n\n What is a beautiful multiset?\n   For every binary string t of length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix must be <= c_t.\n\n Note: The multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. However, note that the condition applies to every string s (which can be of any length from 1 to n). \n\n How does the condition relate to the multiset?\n   Consider a string t (prefix) of length L (from 1 to n). In the multiset, which consists of strings of length n, a string s (in the multiset) has t as a prefix if and only if the first L characters of s are exactly t.\n\n But note: the same multiset element might be counted for multiple prefixes? Actually, each string in the multiset is of length n, so it has exactly one prefix of length i for each i from 1 to n? Not exactly: the condition for a prefix t of length L (<=n) is that the count of multiset elements that start with t must be <= c_t.\n\n However, note: the multiset may contain duplicate strings? The example {11,01,00,01} has two '01'. So duplicates are allowed.\n\n How to think about the maximum size of a beautiful multiset?\n\n Let M be a multiset of strings of length n (each string is over {0,1}) and let x_s be the multiplicity of the string s (so |M| = sum_{s} x_s).\n\n Condition: For every string t (of length from 1 to n), \n     (# of strings in M that have t as prefix) <= c_t.\n\n How many strings in M have t as a prefix? \n     It's the sum of x_s for all s such that s starts with t.\n\n But note: t is of length L (<=n). If L < n, then s must be of the form t followed by any (n-L) bits? Actually, no: the prefix condition is that the first L characters of s are t. So s must have at least L characters, and the first L are t. But our multiset only contains strings of length n, so s must be of length n and the first L characters must be t.\n\n However, note that the problem considers all binary strings s of length from 1 to n for the condition. This includes t (if t is of length L, then we require the count for t) and also longer prefixes. But note: the multiset condition is defined for every prefix.\n\n How to maximize the size of M?\n\n We can think of building M by adding strings one by one. Each string we add must not break the conditions. However, note that when we add a string s (of length n) then for every prefix t of s (of length L from 1 to n), the count for t increases by 1. Therefore, the condition for t is that the total count for t (which is the sum of multiplicities of all strings that have t as prefix) must be <= c_t.\n\n Since we are free to choose the multiplicities arbitrarily (nonnegative integers) as long as the condition holds, the maximum total size of M is limited by the constraints imposed by the c_t.\n\n However, note: the assignment of c_t is done by us (the problem says \"for every binary string s [from length 1 to n] choose an integer c_s from 0 to k\").\n\n We are to count the number of ways to assign the c_s (for every binary string s of length from 1 to n) such that:\n\n   - Each c_s is in the range [0, k].\n   - The maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset (i.e., the maximum total multiplicity |M|) is exactly f.\n\n How do we compute the maximum size of M for a fixed assignment of c_s?\n\n Let T be the set of all binary strings of length from 1 to n. We have constraints for each t in T: the total multiplicity of all strings that have t as prefix must be <= c_t.\n\n But note: the same string s (of length n) has several prefixes: for each L from 1 to n, the prefix of length L of s. So adding s contributes 1 to the count for each of its prefixes.\n\n However, the constraints for different prefixes are independent. But note: if a string s is included, then it must satisfy the condition for every one of its prefixes. But the constraint for a prefix t is that the entire count for t (which is the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) (ranging from 0 to \\( k \\)) to every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as a multiset of binary strings of length exactly \\( n \\) where for every prefix \\( t \\) (of any length from 1 to \\( n \\)), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( t \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_t \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the most restrictive \\( c_s \\) values. Specifically, the maximum multiset size is constrained by the smallest \\( c_s \\) among all prefixes. For each binary string \\( s \\) of length \\( L \\), the value \\( c_s \\) must be at least the number of strings in the multiset that start with \\( s \\). However, since the multiset can include duplicates, the constraint is global.\n\n2. **Insight**: The maximum multiset size \\( f \\) is influenced by the constraints on the prefixes. For the multiset to have size exactly \\( f \\), there must exist at least one prefix \\( t \\) such that \\( c_t = f \\) and for all other prefixes, \\( c_t \\geq f \\). This ensures that \\( f \\) is the tightest constraint.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution involves counting the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) values. For each binary string \\( s \\), \\( c_s \\) can range from 0 to \\( k \\). However, the condition requires that the smallest \\( c_s \\) across all prefixes is exactly \\( f \\). \n\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**: The problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose \\( c_s \\) values such that:\n   - At least one \\( c_s \\) is exactly \\( f \\).\n   - All other \\( c_s \\) values are at least \\( f \\) (to ensure \\( f \\) is the maximum possible multiset size).\n\n5. **Efficient Calculation**: Using combinatorial mathematics, we compute the number of valid assignments by considering two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: Exactly one prefix has \\( c_s = f \\), and all others are greater than or equal to \\( f \\).\n   - **Case 2**: More than one prefix has \\( c_s = f \\), and the rest are greater than or equal to \\( f \\).\n\nThe total number of valid assignments is then given by the difference between the total assignments where all \\( c_s \\geq f \\) and those where all \\( c_s > f \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    f_val = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_strings = 2**(n) - 1\n    \n    if f_val > k:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total_ways_at_least_f = pow(k - f_val + 1, total_strings, MOD)\n    total_ways_strictly_above_f = pow(k - f_val, total_strings, MOD) if f_val < k else 0\n    \n    result = (total_ways_at_least_f - total_ways_strictly_above_f) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three integers \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and \\( f \\). These represent the maximum length of binary strings, the upper bound for \\( c_s \\), and the desired multiset size, respectively.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If \\( f \\) exceeds \\( k \\), the result is immediately 0 because it's impossible to have a multiset size larger than \\( k \\).\n3. **Combinatorial Calculations**: \n   - `total_ways_at_least_f` calculates the number of ways to assign \\( c_s \\) values such that all \\( c_s \\) are at least \\( f \\). This is done using the formula \\( (k - f + 1)^{\\text{total\\_strings}} \\), where `total_strings` is the total number of binary strings of lengths 1 to \\( n \\) (which is \\( 2^n - 1 \\)).\n   - `total_ways_strictly_above_f` calculates the number of ways to assign \\( c_s \\) values such that all \\( c_s \\) are strictly greater than \\( f \\). This is \\( (k - f)^{\\text{total\\_strings}} \\) if \\( f < k \\), otherwise 0.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by subtracting the count of invalid assignments (where all \\( c_s > f \\)) from the count of valid assignments (where all \\( c_s \\geq f \\)), modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages combinatorial mathematics to solve the problem within the constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and \\( f \\).",
