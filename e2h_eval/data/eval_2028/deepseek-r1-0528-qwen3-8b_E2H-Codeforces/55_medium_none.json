    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Notice that:\n - We cannot swap '0' and '2' directly, but note that we can use the intermediate '1' to move them around.\n\n However, let's think about the relative positions of the digits:\n\n We have three types: '0', '1', '2'\n\n Since we can swap '0' and '1' arbitrarily (because they are adjacent and we can do any number of swaps) and similarly for '1' and '2',\n we can think of the following:\n\n In fact, note that the operations are only allowed between two consecutive distinct digits. This means that the relative order of the same digits cannot be changed arbitrarily, but different digits can be rearranged with constraints.\n\n Actually, we can consider the problem as having two independent chains:\n\n Chain 1: '0' and '1' can be arbitrarily rearranged? But wait, we cannot swap '0' and '2'. Similarly, we can rearrange '1' and '2' arbitrarily, but how does that interact?\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Operation 1: swapping '0' and '1' (adjacent)\n Operation 2: swapping '1' and '2' (adjacent)\n\n We can use the '1' as a mediator to swap '0' and '2'? Actually, consider:\n\n Example: \"02\"\n We cannot swap directly. But if we have \"012\", then:\n   Step1: swap the first two: \"102\"\n   Step2: swap the last two: \"120\"\n\n So in three steps we moved the '0' past a '2' by using a '1'. However, note that we don't necessarily have a '1' in the string.\n\n Another example: \"02\" -> we cannot move the '0' to the right beyond a '2' without a '1' in between? Actually, no. But wait, what if we have multiple characters?\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem is similar to having two independent orders: one for '0' and '2' (with '1' being able to break the barrier) but actually the presence of '1' allows mixing.\n\n Insight:\n\n The allowed swaps form two independent adjacent transpositions: (0,1) and (1,2). This is similar to having two independent bubble sort processes for the two pairs, but note that the entire set {0,1,2} is connected via the element '1'.\n\n However, we can note:\n\n - A '0' can only move left until it hits another '0' (since we can swap with '1' but not with '2')? Actually, moving a '0': \n   - To the left: we can swap with '1' (so we can move left through '1's) but not with '2'.\n   - To the right: we can swap with '1' (if there is a '1' to the right) but not with '2'.\n\n Similarly, a '2' can move right through '1's but not through '0's.\n\n And a '1' can move both left and right through both '0' and '2'.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of the '0's and '2's is fixed? Not exactly. Because we can use the '1's to \"break\" the barrier.\n\n Actually, we can think of the entire process as:\n\n We can independently rearrange the positions of:\n   - All the '0's and the '1's arbitrarily? (Because swapping '0' and '1' is allowed, so we can permute the '0's and '1's arbitrarily as long as we don't break the relative order of the '0's and the relative order of the '1's? Actually, no: because the swaps are adjacent and we can do any number, then the '0's and '1's can be rearranged arbitrarily (like bubble sort). Similarly, the '1's and '2's can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n But then what about the '0's and '2's? They cannot be swapped directly, but note that we can use the '1's to separate them. However, the relative order of the '0's and '2's might be altered if we use '1's to bypass.\n\n Let me try with a small example: \"02\"\n\n Without any '1', we cannot change \"02\". \n\n Now consider \"012\": we can rearrange to \"102\", then \"120\", so we can get \"120\" from \"012\". Similarly, from \"012\" we can also get \"012\", \"021\" (wait, how?), actually:\n\n Steps for \"012\" to \"021\":\n   We cannot swap the last two because they are '1' and '2' (allowed) so we can swap to \"021\". Then we can swap the first two: \"0\" and \"2\" are not allowed.\n\n But wait, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1' (so only when the adjacent pair is \"01\" or \"10\"). Similarly for '1' and '2'.\n\n So from \"012\":\n   Swap the first two (0 and 1): becomes \"102\"\n   Then swap the last two (1 and 2): becomes \"120\"\n\n How to get \"021\"? \n   From \"012\": \n        Swap the last two (1 and 2): becomes \"021\"\n\n So we can get both \"021\" and \"120\".\n\n Now, what is the lexicographically smallest?\n\n Compare \"021\" and \"012\" (original) and \"102\", \"120\", etc.\n\n Lexicographic order: \n   \"012\", \"021\", \"102\", \"120\", \"201\", ... \n\n We want the minimum.\n\n Observation: The key is that we can arrange the entire string so that all the '0's come first, then all the '1's, then all the '2's? \n\n But wait: we cannot swap '0' and '2'. However, note that we can use the '1's to separate them. Actually, we can use the following:\n\n We can independently rearrange the '0's and the '1's, and the '1's and the '2's. Then the entire string must have the property that the '0's and '2's are separated by the '1's. But note: we can interleave the '0's and '2's arbitrarily as long as we don't put a '0' after a '2' without a '1' in between? Actually, no: because we can use the '1's to move the '0's to the left and the '2's to the right.\n\n However, note: we can also have multiple '1's. The operations allow us to:\n\n   - Rearrange the '0's arbitrarily among themselves (but we cannot change the relative order of two '0's? Actually, we can: because if we have two '0's, we can swap them? No, because swapping requires an adjacent pair of different characters. So two same digits cannot be swapped.\n\n But wait, the operation is defined for two adjacent distinct digits. So same digits cannot be swapped. Therefore, the relative order of the identical digits is fixed.\n\n However, we can use other digits to \"jump\" over them. For example, two '0's: we cannot swap them, but if we have a '1' between them, we can move the '1' around and effectively change the order of the two '0's? \n\n Example: \"00\" has two zeros. We cannot swap them. So they must remain in the same order.\n\n But what if we have \"0_1_0\", then we can move the '1' arbitrarily. Then the two zeros are fixed in their original order? Actually, the two zeros are fixed relative to each other because we cannot change their order without swapping, and we cannot swap two zeros.\n\n Similarly for the '2's.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of the '0's remains the same, the relative order of the '2's remains the same, and the relative order of the '1's remains the same? \n\n But wait: we can use the '1's to break the order. Actually, the relative order of the '0's is fixed, because we cannot swap two zeros. Similarly for the '2's.\n\n However, note: the entire process allows us to rearrange the entire string as long as we preserve the relative order of the '0's, the relative order of the '1's, and the relative order of the '2's.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: given three independent sequences (the zeros, the ones, and the twos) that must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, what is the lexicographically smallest interleaving?\n\n This is a classical problem of merging three sorted lists (each sorted by their natural order, and we just need to merge them while preserving the order within each). But note: we are allowed to interleave arbitrarily the three sequences, but we cannot break the internal order.\n\n So we can use a greedy algorithm: we have three pointers for the three sequences (zeros, ones, twos). Then at each position, we choose the smallest available character (from the three) that hasn't been placed yet, but we must take them in the order they appear.\n\n However, note: the entire string is built by the three independent sequences. We can choose which one to output next from the three, as long as we take the next available element from the sequence that we are currently processing.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Let:\n    zeros = list of indices (or simply the entire list) of the '0' characters, but we only care about the order they appear.\n    ones = list of indices of the '1' characters.\n    twos = list of indices of the '2' characters.\n\n But wait, the problem says the relative order of the same digits is fixed. So we can extract:\n\n  z = [char for char in s if char == '0']   # This preserves the order\n  o = [char for char in s if char == '1']\n  t = [char for char in s if char == '2']\n\n Then we want to merge these three lists (each is in increasing index order, i.e., the order of appearance) and choose the smallest character at each step.\n\n However, note: the smallest character is '0', then '1', then '2'. But we cannot take a '0' if the next available '0' is not the next occurrence? Actually, we have to take the next occurrence of each type in the order they appear.\n\n Example: s = \"100210\"\n\n Original: ['1','0','0','2','1','0']\n\n Then:\n   zeros = ['0','0','0'] (from indices 1,2,5)\n   ones  = ['1','1'] (from indices 0,4)\n   twos  = ['2'] (index 3)\n\n Now, the merged string should be built by:\n\n   We can only take a '0' if we have taken all the characters that appeared before the current '0' in the original string? Actually, no: we are allowed to take a '0' even if there is a '1' that comes later in the original string? \n\n But note: we cannot change the relative order of the same digits. So the zeros must appear in the same order as in the original: so the first zero must come before the second zero, which must come before the third zero.\n\n Similarly, the ones must appear in the order: the first '1' (at index0) must come before the second '1' (at index4).\n\n However, we can interleave arbitrarily with the other digits.\n\n The goal is to get the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n The lexicographical order is defined by the usual order: '0' < '1' < '2'\n\n So we want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then ones, then twos? But we cannot break the relative order.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n   We have three pointers i, j, k for the zeros, ones, twos arrays.\n\n   Then, we choose the smallest character available from the three heads (if available) and append it, then move the pointer for that array.\n\n   But note: we are not limited by the original positions? Actually, we are: the zeros must appear in the original order, so we cannot take the next zero until we have taken all zeros that appeared earlier (but wait, we are breaking the string into three independent sequences). \n\n   Actually, the condition is: the zeros must appear in the same relative order as in the original, meaning that if we look at the positions of zeros in the original, then in the output the zeros must appear in increasing order of their original indices.\n\n   Similarly for ones and twos.\n\n   However, note: the entire string is built by interleaving the three sequences. So the rule is: the zeros we output must be the zeros in the order of increasing index, the ones in increasing index, and the twos in increasing index.\n\n   But we are free to choose which one to output at each step, as long as we don't break the order.\n\n   Example: \"100210\"\n\n   Original indices:\n     zeros: at positions 1,2,5 -> so the first zero must be the one at index1, then the one at index2, then the one at index5.\n     ones: at positions 0,4 -> so the first one must be the one at index0, then the one at index4.\n     twos: at position 3.\n\n   Now, we start:\n\n     We can choose between:\n        next zero: '0' (from index1)\n        next one: '1' (from index0) -> but wait, the one at index0 is the first one, and we haven't taken any one, so we can take it.\n\n     But compare: '0' (zero) and '1' (one): lexicographically, '0' is smaller. So we take the zero.\n\n     Then the next available:\n        next zero: still the same (we haven't taken the one at index0, but wait: the original string has the one at index0 before the zero at index1. So we must have taken the one at index0? No, because we are allowed to interleave arbitrarily as long as the relative order is preserved.\n\n     However, the condition is: the relative order of the same digits is preserved. But the relative order between different digits is not fixed.\n\n     But note: the entire process doesn't fix the relative order between different digits. For example, in the original string, the one at index0 is before the zero at index1. In our output, we can put the zero at index1 first and then the one at index0? That would break the relative order because in the original the one was at a lower index. \n\n     Wait, no: the relative order of the same digits must be preserved, but what about different digits? The problem states: we can swap adjacent '0' and '1' arbitrarily. This means that we can change the relative order of '0' and '1' arbitrarily? \n\n     Actually, let me re-read: the problem says we can swap adjacent '0' and '1' and adjacent '1' and '2'. This implies that we can rearrange the entire string arbitrarily for the two groups: the group of '0' and '1' can be rearranged arbitrarily (because we can swap any adjacent '0' and '1'), and the group of '1' and '2' can be rearranged arbitrarily. However, the entire set of three is not independent because the '1' is shared.\n\n     But note: the relative order of the zeros and the ones can be broken because we can swap them arbitrarily. Similarly, the relative order of the ones and the twos can be broken. However, the relative order of the zeros and the twos cannot be broken because we cannot swap them.\n\n     However, wait: the example above: we cannot swap a zero and a two, but we can use the one to swap them indirectly. But the example showed that we could break the relative order of zero and two.\n\n     Actually, the example \"012\" became \"120\", which changed the relative order of the zero and the two (originally the zero was first, then one, then two; in the result the two is first, then one, then zero). But wait, that example had a one in between. \n\n     But what if there is no one? Then we cannot break the barrier.\n\n     Therefore, the constraint is: \n        The relative order of zeros and twos can be changed if and only if there is at least one '1' present to mediate.\n\n     However, the problem does not require the relative order of zeros and twos to be preserved if we have ones in between. But note: the problem does not fix the relative order of zeros and twos. \n\n     After re-thinking: the operations allow us to rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily, and the ones and twos arbitrarily. Therefore, we can independently rearrange the zeros and the twos as long as we don't break the connections via the ones.\n\n     But note: the zeros and twos are separated by the ones. Actually, we can consider:\n\n        We can move a zero to the left through ones, and a two to the right through ones.\n\n        However, if we have a zero and a two that are separated by ones, we can use the ones to let the zero go to the left and the two to the right, so the zero will come before the two.\n\n     But wait: what if we have a two and then a zero and then a one? Example: \"201\"\n\n        We can swap the '0' and the '1': becomes \"210\"\n        Then swap the '2' and the '1': becomes \"120\"\n\n        So the zero ends up at the front, and the two is pushed to the back.\n\n     Similarly, we can push zeros to the front and twos to the back, but only if we have ones to help.\n\n     However, if there are no ones, then we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n     Therefore, the minimal lexicographical string is obtained by:\n\n        If there is at least one '1' in the string, then we can push all zeros to the front, then all ones, then all twos? But wait, we cannot break the relative order of zeros, ones, and twos. \n\n     Actually, the key is: we can independently rearrange the zeros and the ones, and the ones and the twos. Therefore, the entire string can be rearranged such that:\n\n        All zeros come before all ones, and all ones come before all twos? \n\n     But wait: we can also have zeros and ones arbitrarily interleaved, and ones and twos arbitrarily interleaved, but we cannot change the relative order of zeros and ones? \n\n     Correction: the operations allow swapping adjacent zeros and ones arbitrarily, so the zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily. Similarly, the ones and twos can be rearranged arbitrarily. \n\n     But note: the zeros and twos: we cannot swap them directly, but we can use the ones to break the barrier. However, the relative order of zeros and twos might be changed arbitrarily if there is at least one '1'? \n\n     Actually, the entire process allows us to put zeros anywhere to the left of the ones and the twos, and the ones anywhere to the left of the twos, but we must preserve the relative order of zeros, ones, and twos? \n\n     Let me clarify with the example: \"012\" -> we can get \"012\", \"021\", \"102\", \"120\", \"201\", \"210\". \n\n     Actually, the set of achievable strings is all the strings that have the same multiset of characters and that have the zeros and ones in an order that is consistent with the original zeros and ones (i.e., the zeros appear in the original order, the ones in the original order, and the twos in the original order) and the zeros and twos can be arbitrarily interleaved as long as the ones are used to break the barrier? \n\n     But wait, the operations are adjacent swaps and we can do any number, so the entire string is rearranged arbitrarily as long as the relative order of zeros is preserved, the relative order of ones is preserved, and the relative order of twos is preserved.\n\n     Therefore, the problem is: given three independent sequences (zeros, ones, twos) that must appear in their original order, and we can interleave them arbitrarily, what is the lexicographically smallest interleaving?\n\n     Then we can use a greedy algorithm: we have three pointers for the three sequences. At each step, we choose the smallest character available (which is the head of one of the sequences) that we haven't taken from that sequence, and then advance the pointer for that sequence.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Let:\n            i, j, k = 0, 0, 0   (pointers for zeros, ones, twos)\n            res = []\n\n        While i < len(zeros) or j < len(ones) or k < len(twos):\n            Choose the smallest character among:\n                zeros[i] if i < len(zeros) else None\n                ones[j] if j < len(ones) else None\n                twos[k] if k < len(twos) else None\n\n            But note: the zeros, ones, twos are just the characters, but we have to output the character. However, we have stored the zeros as a list of '0's, ones as a list of '1's, twos as a list of '2's.\n\n            Actually, we can store:\n\n                zeros = [c for c in s if c=='0']   # list of '0'\n                ones  = [c for c in s if c=='1']    # list of '1'\n                twos  = [c for c in s if c=='2']    # list of '2'\n\n            Then the smallest character is '0' if available, then '1', then '2'.\n\n        Example \"100210\": \n\n            zeros = ['0','0','0']\n            ones  = ['1','1']\n            twos  = ['2']\n\n            Step1: choose the smallest: '0' (from zeros). Then we remove the first '0' from zeros -> zeros becomes ['0','0'], ones remains ['1','1'], twos remains ['2'].\n\n            Step2: again choose '0' (from zeros). Then zeros becomes ['0'], ones remains, twos remains.\n\n            Step3: now we have two choices: '0' (from zeros) and '1' (from ones). The smallest is '0'. Then zeros becomes [].\n\n            Step4: now we have '1' (from ones) and '2' (from twos). The smallest is '1'. Then ones becomes ['1'].\n\n            Step5: now we have '1' and '2'. The smallest is '1'. Then ones becomes [].\n\n            Step6: then we have only '2'. Then we output '2'.\n\n            Result: \"000112\"\n\n            But the expected output for \"100210\" is \"001120\" (according to the example input/output). \n\n            Example input: \n                Input: ['100210', '11222121', '20']\n                Output: ['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\n            Why is the expected output for \"100210\" \"001120\"?\n\n            Let me check: \n\n            Original string: \"100210\"\n\n            Our greedy produced \"000112\", but the expected is \"001120\".\n\n            Why? \n\n            The problem: we must preserve the relative order of the same digits. In the original string, the zeros are at indices 1,2,5. The ones at 0,4 and the two at 3.\n\n            In the output \"000112\", the zeros are output in the order of their original indices? \n\n            The first zero we took was the one at index1, then the one at index2, then the one at index5. That is the correct relative order.\n\n            The ones: we took the one at index0 and then the one at index4. Correct.\n\n            The two: we took the two at index3.\n\n            So why is the expected output \"001120\"?\n\n            Let me compare lexicographically:\n\n                \"000112\" vs \"001120\"\n\n                First two characters: both \"00\"\n                Third character: '0' vs '1' -> '0' is smaller. So \"000112\" is lexicographically smaller.\n\n            But the example output for input \"100210\" is \"001120\", which is not the same as our result.\n\n            There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n            Let me check the example input and output:\n\n            Example input: \n                ['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n            Expected output:\n                ['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\n            So for \"100210\" -> \"001120\"\n\n            Why is \"000112\" not acceptable? \n\n            Let me simulate the operations to see if we can get \"000112\":\n\n            Original: \"100210\"\n\n            We need to move the first '1' (at index0) to the end, and the two (at index3) to the end? \n\n            Actually, we want to put all zeros at the front. But note: we have three zeros, two ones, and one two.\n\n            How to get \"000112\"?\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Start: \"100210\"\n\n            We can swap the first two (1 and 0) to get \"010210\"\n            Then swap the next two (1 and0) to get \"001210\"\n            Then swap the '1' and the '2' (at positions 2 and3): \"000211\" -> wait, that gives \"000211\", but we want \"000112\".\n\n            Alternatively:\n\n            From \"001210\", we can then swap the '2' and the '1' (at positions 3 and4) to get \"001120\", which is the expected output.\n\n            Why can't we get \"000112\"?\n\n            In \"000112\", the last two characters are '1' and '2'. But in the original string, the two is at index3 and the second one is at index4. So the two originally appears before the last one. \n\n            In the output \"000112\", the two is at the end, meaning we must have moved the two (which originally was at index3) to the very end, passing the last one (which was at index4). \n\n            Is that allowed?\n\n            We can swap adjacent '1' and '2'. So we can move the two to the right through ones.\n\n            Steps for \"000112\" from \"001210\":\n\n            We have \"001210\", and we want to move the two from index3 to the end.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Step1: swap the two at index3 with the one at index4: \"001120\" -> this is the expected output.\n\n            How to get \"000112\" from the original?\n\n            We must move the first '1' (at index0) to the end, and the two (at index3) to the end, and the other one (at index4) to the end? \n\n            Actually, we have two ones: the one at index0 and the one at index4.\n\n            In \"000112\", the two ones are both at the end, and the two is at the very end. \n\n            Steps:\n\n            Original: \"100210\"\n\n            We want to remove the first '1' (index0) and the two (index3) and the other one (index4) to the end.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Step1: swap index0 ('1') with index1 ('0'): \"010210\"\n            Step2: swap index1 ('1') with index2 ('0'): \"001210\"\n            Step3: swap index3 ('2') with index4 ('1'): \"001120\" -> stuck.\n\n            Alternatively, after step2 we have \"001210\", then we want to move the first '1' (which is now at index2) to the end? \n\n            But the first '1' is at index2, and we cannot swap a '0' and a '1' arbitrarily? Actually, we can, but we have to do:\n\n            Step3: swap index2 ('1') with index3 ('2'): not allowed because we can only swap adjacent '1' and '2' if they are consecutive? Actually, the two are consecutive: so we can swap the '1' and the '2' at indices2 and3: \"002110\"\n\n            Then we have \"002110\". Now we have a two at index2 and ones at indices3 and4.\n\n            Then we can swap the two at index2 with the one at index3: \"001210\" again.\n\n            Or from \"002110\", we can swap the two at index2 with the one at index1? But they are not adjacent. \n\n            So we cannot jump over the zeros.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot get \"000112\".\n\n            What is happening?\n\n            The catch: the relative order of the same digits must be preserved, but also the relative order of the zeros and the ones and the twos must be preserved in the sense that we cannot pass one digit through another without violating the rules? \n\n            Actually, the operations are reversible and the group of zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily, and the group of ones and twos can be rearranged arbitrarily, but the zeros and twos cannot be swapped directly. \n\n            However, note: the entire string is built by the three independent sequences (zeros, ones, twos) and we can interleave arbitrarily as long as the internal order is preserved.\n\n            But wait: in the output \"000112\", the zeros are in the order of the original (first, second, third zero), the ones are in the order (first one, second one) and the two is the only two.\n\n            The issue is: the original string has the two at index3 and the second one at index4. In the output \"000112\", the two is at the end, meaning we have moved the two from index3 to the last position, and the ones from indices0,4 to the positions after the zeros. \n\n            However, note: the two originally was at index3 and the second one at index4. In the output, the two is at the last position and the second one is at the fifth position. This means we have moved the two from index3 to the last index (which is index5) and the second one from index4 to index5? That is not allowed because we cannot swap the two and the one that was originally after the two.\n\n            Actually, the relative order of the two and the second one must be preserved? \n\n            The original string: \n                index0: '1'\n                index1: '0'\n                index2: '0'\n                index3: '2'\n                index4: '1'\n                index5: '0'\n\n            The two at index3 must come before the one at index4? In the output \"000112\", the one at index4 is at position 4 and the two is at position5. So the two is after the one, which breaks the relative order (because originally the two was before the one).\n\n            Therefore, the constraint is: the relative order of the two and the one (and any two distinct digits that are not connected by a chain of ones) must be preserved? \n\n            Actually, the operations allow us to swap adjacent zeros and ones, and adjacent ones and twos. This means that we can change the relative order of zeros and ones, and ones and twos, but not zeros and twos directly. However, we can change the relative order of zeros and twos if we use ones to break the barrier. \n\n            But the relative order of zeros and twos is not fixed, but the relative order of the two distinct digits that are not connected by ones might be fixed? \n\n            Actually, the entire set of zeros and twos are separated by the ones. When we have a zero and a two, if there is at least one one between them, then we can rearrange them arbitrarily. But if there isn't, then we cannot.\n\n            However, note: the problem does not say anything about the original positions of the ones. The operations are local (adjacent swaps) and we can do any number. \n\n            The invariant: the relative order of the zeros and the ones can be arbitrary, the relative order of the ones and the twos can be arbitrary, but the relative order of the zeros and the twos is not arbitrary: we cannot swap a zero and a two directly, and if we want to swap them we must use the ones in between. \n\n            But the catch is: the relative order of the zeros and the twos must be the same as the original if there is no one between them? \n\n            Actually, the relative order of the zeros and the twos is not fixed, but the entire string is built by the three independent sequences (with their own orders) and we can interleave arbitrarily. \n\n            However, the above greedy algorithm produces a string that preserves the relative order of the zeros, ones, and twos. But note: the greedy algorithm does not necessarily produce a string that is achievable by the operations.\n\n            Why is \"000112\" not achievable? \n\n            The reason is that the operations preserve the relative order of the zeros and the twos that are separated by ones. But the greedy algorithm does not account for the possibility that a zero and a two might be forced to maintain their original relative order if there is no one between them.\n\n            However, wait: the greedy algorithm produces a string that is an interleaving of the three sequences (zeros, ones, twos) in their original order. And that is exactly the set of strings that are reachable: because we can rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily and the ones and twos arbitrarily, so we can achieve any interleaving that preserves the relative order of zeros, ones, and twos.\n\n            But then why can't we achieve \"000112\" for \"100210\"?\n\n            Let me check the relative order in the original string for the zeros and the two:\n\n            Original: \n                zeros: indices [1,2,5]\n                two: index [3]\n\n            The two is at index3, which is between the second zero (index2) and the third zero (index5). In the output \"000112\", the two is at the end, so the two has been moved past the last zero (which is at index5 originally) and the two ones (which are at indices0 and4). \n\n            But the original string does not have a one between the two and the last zero. The last zero is at index5 and the two is at index3. There is a one at index4 (which is after the two) and a one at index0 (which is before the two). \n\n            How did we move the two from index3 to the end? We must have passed through the one at index4. But the one at index4 is after the two in the original string, so we cannot move the two to the right of the one at index4 because the operation allows swapping the two and the one (adjacent) but only if they are consecutive. \n\n            However, in the original string, the two is at index3 and the one is at index4, so they are consecutive. So we can swap them. But then the two moves to index4 and the one to index3. Then we can continue swapping the two with the one that was originally at index0? \n\n            Let's simulate:\n\n            Original: \"100210\" -> positions: 0:'1', 1:'0', 2:'0', 3:'2', 4:'1', 5:'0'\n\n            Step1: swap index0 and1: \"010210\"\n            Step2: swap index1 and2: \"001210\"\n            Step3: swap index3 and4: \"001120\"   -> Here we have the two at index4.\n\n            Now, to move the two further, we need to swap it with the one at index3? But they are not adjacent (there's a '1' at index3 and the two at index4). Wait, in \"001120\", the string is:\n\n            index0: '0'\n            index1: '0'\n            index2: '1'\n            index3: '1'\n            index4: '2'\n            index5: '0'\n\n            The two is at index4, and the next character is '0' at index5. We cannot swap two and zero.\n\n            So we cannot move the two further to the right.\n\n            But wait, we can move the two to the left? \n\n            In",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing any number of adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', or between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that the relative order of the same characters must remain unchanged, but different characters can be interleaved in any way as long as their relative order is preserved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem allows us to swap adjacent '0' and '1' or adjacent '1' and '2' any number of times. This means we can rearrange the string such that all '0's come before all '1's and all '1's come before all '2's, but the relative order within each group ('0's, '1's, '2's) must remain the same as in the original string.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves merging three separate sequences (all '0's, all '1's, and all '2's) while preserving their original order. The lexicographically smallest string is obtained by always choosing the smallest available character from the three sequences at each step.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy algorithm where we maintain three pointers for each sequence ('0's, '1's, '2's). At each step, we select the smallest character available from the current positions of these sequences and append it to the result, advancing the corresponding pointer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the sequences and the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append('0')\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append('1')\n        else:\n            twos.append('2')\n            \n    i = j = k = 0\n    res = []\n    \n    while i < len(zeros) or j < len(ones) or k < len(twos):\n        if i < len(zeros) and (j >= len(ones) or (k >= len(twos) or '0' <= ones[j] and '0' <= twos[k])):\n            res.append('0')\n            i += 1\n        elif j < len(ones) and (i >= len(zeros) or (k >= len(twos) or '1' <= zeros[i] and '1' <= twos[k])):\n            res.append('1')\n            j += 1\n        elif k < len(twos):\n            res.append('2')\n            k += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and processed to separate the characters into three lists: `zeros`, `ones`, and `twos`, each maintaining the original order of their respective characters.\n2. **Merging Sequences**: Using three pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`), the algorithm iterates through the three sequences. At each step, it selects the smallest available character ('0' if available, otherwise '1', and finally '2') and appends it to the result list.\n3. **Output Result**: The merged result is printed as the lexicographically smallest string achievable by the allowed operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently merges the three sequences while preserving their internal order, ensuring the smallest lexicographical result is achieved.",
