Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) all letters must be the same.\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the integer n.\n - Read the grid of n lines.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let the grid be a list of strings: grid[i][j] for row i and column j.\n\n Condition 1: \n   For the main diagonal: all grid[i][i] must be the same (say letter 'x').\n   For the anti-diagonal: all grid[i][n-1-i] must be the same (same letter 'x').\n\n But note: the center square is common to both diagonals, so we require that the letter on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal at the center is the same? Actually, yes, because the center must satisfy both.\n\n Condition 2:\n   For every cell (i, j) that is not on either diagonal, the letter must be the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   - The diagonals must have the same letter throughout (on both diagonals).\n   - The rest must be the same letter and that letter must be different from the diagonal one.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Check the two diagonals.\n   Let diag_letter = grid[i][i] for the main diagonal. But wait, what if the main diagonal has multiple letters? They must all be equal.\n   Similarly, the anti-diagonal: grid[i][n-1-i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n   We can do:\n     diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n     diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n   Then, check that all elements in diag1 are the same, and all in diag2 are the same.\n\n   Also, note: the center element is at index (n//2, n//2) and should be the same for both diagonals? Actually, the condition requires that the diagonals have the same letter. So if the main diagonal has letter 'x' and the anti-diagonal has letter 'y', then we require that the center (which is in both) must have the same letter? Actually, the center is in both, so the letter at the center must be the same for both conditions. Therefore, we require that the entire main diagonal is one letter, the entire anti-diagonal is one letter, and these two letters must be the same? \n\n   Wait, let me read again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say they have to be the same as each other, but the example: \n        Input: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n        Output: NO\n\n        Why? Because the center is 's' (from \"soxoo\") and the diagonals must be the same throughout. In the main diagonal: \n          positions: (0,0): 'x', (1,1): 'o', (2,2): 's', (3,3): 'o', (4,4): 'x'\n        That's not the same letter! So the example fails because the main diagonal isn't all the same. \n\n   Therefore, the condition is:\n      The main diagonal must be all the same, say letter A.\n      The anti-diagonal must be all the same, say letter B.\n\n   But note: the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is \"YES\".\n\n   For n=3:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n   Main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][2]='w'] -> all 'w'\n   Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][0]='w'] -> all 'w'\n\n   So the diagonals are the same. Now the other cells: \n        (0,1): 's', (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,1): 's'\n   These are all 's', and 's' != 'w'. So condition holds.\n\n   But wait, the example input 3: \"xpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" is \"NO\".\n\n        x p x\n        p x p\n        x p e\n\n   Main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e'] -> not the same (because 'x' and 'e')\n   So condition 1 fails. Therefore, output \"NO\".\n\n   However, note: the example input 3: \"wsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is YES.\n\n   So the diagonals must be the same, but the two diagonals don't necessarily have to have the same letter as long as each diagonal is uniform? \n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   This means: \n        Condition 1: The main diagonal is composed of one letter (say A)\n        Condition 2: The anti-diagonal is composed of one letter (say B)\n\n   There is no requirement that A == B. But wait, look at the example: \n        Input: \n          3\n          www\n          www\n          www\n\n        Is this an X? \n        The diagonals are both 'w'. Then the rest are also 'w'. Then condition 2 fails because the rest must be a letter different from the diagonal's letter. So it would be \"NO\".\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\" \n\n   So the rest must be a single letter (say C) and C != A and C != B. However, if A and B are the same, then we require C != A (and same as B). \n\n   However, note: the problem does not say the diagonals must be the same letter. It only says each diagonal individually is the same. \n\n   But consider: if the two diagonals have different letters, then the center (which is in both) must be the same? No, because the center is one cell: it must be both A and B. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter at the center. But the entire main diagonal is A and the entire anti-diagonal is B, and the center is part of both, so we must have A == B.\n\n   Correction: Actually, the center is the same cell. Therefore, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must have the same letter at the center. But the entire main diagonal is A, and the entire anti-diagonal is B. Since the center is included in both, we must have A == B.\n\n   Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter. \n\n   Example: \n        n=3: \n            w s w\n            s w s\n            w s w\n\n        Main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> A='w'\n        Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> B='w'\n\n        Then the rest must be a letter different from 'w'. In this example, the rest are 's'. So condition holds.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=3:\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, e, i] -> must be same, say A.\n        Anti-diagonal: [c, e, g] -> must be same, say B. And since e is in both, A must equal B.\n\n   Therefore, we can combine:\n\n   Step 1: Check that the main diagonal has the same letter (call it `diag_char`) and the anti-diagonal has the same letter (must be the same as `diag_char`).\n\n   Step 2: Check that for every cell not on the diagonals, the letter is the same and different from `diag_char`.\n\n   How to check if a cell is on the diagonals?\n        Main diagonal: i == j\n        Anti-diagonal: i + j == n-1\n\n   So for a cell (i, j):\n        if i == j or i+j == n-1 -> on a diagonal.\n\n   Now, we can do:\n\n        diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                # But wait, maybe we haven't set diag_char. We can check the entire main diagonal first.\n        Alternatively, we can extract the two diagonals and check.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Check main diagonal and anti-diagonal for having the same letter throughout, and that they are the same letter.\n\n        # Extract main diagonal\n        main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        # Check if main_diag has all the same character\n        if len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        if len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check that the two diagonals have the same letter\n        if main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        diag_char = main_diag[0]\n\n        # Now, check the rest of the grid: all non-diagonal cells must be the same letter and that letter must not be diag_char.\n\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue   # skip diagonal cells\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n\n        # Also, we must ensure that the non_diag_letter (if exists) is not equal to diag_char\n        if valid and non_diag_letter == diag_char:\n            valid = False\n\n        if valid:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, there is a catch: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Only when n=1, but n>=3 (so at least 3x3). So we will have non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But note: we set non_diag_letter to the first non-diagonal cell we find. What if there are no non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n>=3, the grid has n*n cells, and the diagonals have 2*n - 1 cells (overlapping at center). So the number of non-diagonal cells is n*n - (2*n-1) = (n-1)*(n-1) which is positive for n>=3.\n\n   However, let me test with n=3: total cells 9, diagonals have 5 cells (including center twice? actually, center is counted once) -> 3+3-1 = 5, so non-diagonal is 4.\n\n   But wait, our method for setting non_diag_letter: we go through the grid and take the first non-diagonal cell. Then we check that all others are the same.\n\n   However, what if the grid is:\n\n        a a a\n        a a a\n        a a a\n\n   Then the main diagonal is ['a','a','a'] -> diag_char = 'a'\n   Anti-diagonal is ['a','a','a'] -> same, so diag_char remains 'a'\n\n   Then we look at non-diagonal cells: the first non-diagonal cell we meet is (0,1) which is 'a'. Then we set non_diag_letter='a'. Then we check that all non-diagonal cells are 'a'. Then we check that non_diag_letter != diag_char -> 'a' != 'a' -> false -> invalid.\n\n   So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   But what about:\n\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n   We have to form an X. The diagonals must be uniform. So if the main diagonal is not uniform, we output \"NO\". Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n   However, what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but they are different?\n\n        Example: \n            a a a\n            a b a\n            a a a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n        Another example:\n            a b b\n            b b b\n            b b a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n   So the above code should work.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is:\n\n        grid = [\n            \"wsw\",\n            \"sws\",\n            \"wsw\"\n        ]\n\n        main_diag = ['w','w','w'] -> ok, diag_char='w'\n        anti_diag = ['w','w','w'] -> ok, and same as 'w'\n\n        Then non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 's'\n            (1,0): 's'\n            (1,2): 's'\n            (2,1): 's'\n\n        non_diag_letter = 's'\n\n        Then we check that all non-diagonal are 's': yes.\n\n        Then we check that 's' != 'w': yes.\n\n        So output \"YES\".\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            5\n            xooox\n            oxoxo\n            soxoo\n            oxoxo\n            xooox\n\n        main_diag = ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> set has {'x','o','s'} -> length 3 -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        main_diag = ['x','x','e'] -> set has {'x','e'} -> length 2 -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n   So the code above seems to cover.\n\n   However, note: the anti-diagonal extraction: \n        For n=3: \n            row0: j = 3-1-0 = 2 -> grid[0][2] = 'w'\n            row1: j = 3-1-1 = 1 -> grid[1][1] = 'w'\n            row2: j = 3-1-2 = 0 -> grid[2][0] = 'w'\n\n        But wait, the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" has:\n\n            row0: \"wsw\": grid[0][2] is 'w'\n            row1: \"sws\": grid[1][1] is 'w'? Actually, no: \n                row1: \"sws\" -> grid[1][0]='s', grid[1][1]='w', grid[1][2]='s'\n\n            So anti_diag for row1: j = 3-1-1 = 1 -> grid[1][1] is 'w'\n\n        Correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" has:\n\n        grid = [\n            \"xpx\",\n            \"pxp\",\n            \"xpe\"\n        ]\n\n        main_diag = [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] = ['x','x','e'] -> not uniform.\n\n        anti_diag = [grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0]] = ['x','x','x'] -> uniform, but main_diag is not uniform -> NO.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, we can optimize by not building the entire list for diagonals if we break early.\n\n   Revised plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n        Step 2: Check the main diagonal for uniformity and set diag_char if uniform. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n        Step 3: Check the anti-diagonal for uniformity and that its letter is the same as the main diagonal's letter. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n        Step 4: Traverse the grid and collect the non-diagonal cells. Check that they are all the same and that that same letter is different from diag_char.\n\n   But note: we can break early in the diagonal checks.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        diag_char_main = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            char = grid[i][i]\n            if diag_char_main is None:\n                diag_char_main = char\n            elif char != diag_char_main:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        diag_char_anti = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            char = grid[i][n-1-i]\n            if diag_char_anti is None:\n                diag_char_anti = char\n            elif char != diag_char_anti:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        if diag_char_main != diag_char_anti:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        diag_char = diag_char_main\n\n        # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n        # Now, if we found non_diag_char and it is the same as diag_char, then invalid.\n        if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Actually, n>=3, so there will be non-diagonal cells. However, if n==1, then there are no non-diagonal cells. But n>=3, so we are safe.\n\n   However, what if the grid is empty? n>=3.\n\n   But note: if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? Actually, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the ones that are not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal. The main diagonal and anti-diagonal together cover 5 cells (for n=3). So we have 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But wait, the condition: the non-diagonal cells must be the same. What if the grid is:\n\n        a a a\n        a b a\n        a a a\n\n   Then we have non-diagonal cells: the four corners and the two middle of the edges? Actually, in a 3x3:\n\n        (0,0): diagonal\n        (0,1): non-diagonal\n        (0,2): diagonal (anti-diagonal)\n\n        (1,0): non-diagonal\n        (1,1): diagonal (both)\n        (1,2): non-diagonal\n\n        (2,0): diagonal (anti-diagonal)\n        (2,1): non-diagonal\n        (2,2): diagonal\n\n        So non-diagonal: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n   So we must check these four.\n\n   However, the above nested loops will check (0,1) first and set non_diag_char to grid[0][1]. Then (1,0): compare to non_diag_char (grid[0][1]) -> if not equal then NO. Then (1,2) and (2,1) similarly.\n\n   But what if the grid is:\n\n        a b b\n        b b b\n        b b a\n\n   Then main diagonal: [a, b, a] -> not uniform -> we break at i=0: set a, then i=1: grid[1][1]=='b' != 'a' -> NO.\n\n   So we don't get to the anti-diagonal.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   However, note: the problem says n<300, so even if we traverse the entire grid (which is 90000 cells) it's acceptable.\n\n   But let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more corner: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? Actually, for n>=3, there is at least one non-diagonal cell.\n\n   But wait, what if the grid is 1x1? Then n=1, but n>=3 so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        diag_char_main = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                # But wait, if we haven't set diag_char_main, then set it and then compare? Actually, we can set the first and then compare.\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n                #   diag_char_main = grid[0][0]\n                #   for i from 1 to n-1: check grid[i][i] == diag_char_main\n                # But above code sets diag_char_main to the first element and then checks the rest.\n\n        Let me rewrite the main diagonal check without using the first element as reference? Actually, the above code uses the first element as the reference.\n\n        However, if the main diagonal is uniform, then all are grid[0][0]. But if the first element is the same as itself, that's true.\n\n        But what if n==0? Not possible.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        diag_char_main = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if grid[i][i] != diag_char_main:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n        But then we don't use the variable diag_char_main until the end. Actually, we need to know the letter for the anti-diagonal comparison.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n        diag_char_main = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if grid[i][i] != diag_char_main:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        diag_char_anti = grid[0][n-1]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != diag_char_anti:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Now, the center must be the same for both? Actually, the center is at (n//2, n//2) and also at (n//2, n-1-n//2) which is the same as (n//2, n//2) because n//2 + n//2 = n-1? \n        # But wait, for n=3: center is (1,1). \n        #   In the main diagonal: we used grid[0][0] and then grid[1][1] and grid[2][2] must be equal to grid[0][0]. \n        #   In the anti-diagonal: we used grid[0][2] (which is the first element of anti-diagonal) and then grid[1][1] and grid[2][0] must be equal to grid[0][2].\n\n        # Therefore, we require that grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1] (since the center is grid[n//2][n//2] and must be the same as grid[0][0] and grid[0][n-1]). \n\n        But note: the center is grid[n//2][n//2] and must be the same as grid[0][0] (from main diagonal) and the same as grid[0][n-1] (from anti-diagonal). Therefore, we require grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1].\n\n        However, we can also check that after the two loops, we have diag_char_main and diag_char_anti, and then check if they are equal.\n\n        So:\n\n        if diag_char_main != diag_char_anti:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        But note: the entire main diagonal is diag_char_main, and the entire anti-diagonal is diag_char_anti, and they must be the same.\n\n        Now, what if the grid is:\n\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n        We set diag_char_main = grid[0][0] = 'a'\n        Then check: grid[1][1] must be 'a' -> but if it's not, we break.\n\n        Similarly, diag_char_anti = grid[0][n-1] = 'c'\n        Then check: grid[1][1] must be 'c' -> so we require grid[1][1] to be both 'a' and 'c'. \n\n        So if grid[1][1] is not the same as 'a' and not the same as 'c', we break in the main diagonal check. If it is 'a', then we break in the anti-diagonal check because 'a' != 'c'.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        if any(grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] for i in range(n)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        if any(grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1] for i in range(n)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check that the two diagonals have the same letter (they must, because the center is common and the entire main diagonal is grid[0][0] and the entire anti-diagonal is grid[0][n-1])\n        if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        diag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        # Now check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n        if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   Let's test with the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\":\n\n        n=3, grid = [\"wsw\", \"sws\", \"wsw\"]\n\n        Check main diagonal: \n            i=0: grid[0][0]=='w' -> ok.\n            i=1: grid[1][1]=='w' -> ok.\n            i=2: grid[2][2]=='w' -> ok.\n\n        Check anti-diagonal:\n            i=0: grid[0][2]=='w' -> ok.\n            i=1: grid[1][1]=='w' -> ok.\n            i=2: grid[2][0]=='w' -> ok.\n\n        Then check: grid[0][0]=='w' and grid[0][n-1]=grid[0][2]=='w' -> same.\n\n        Then non-diagonal: \n            i=0: j=0 -> skip, j=1 -> non_diag_char = grid[0][1] = 's'\n            Then j=2: skip (diagonal)\n\n            i=1: j=0 -> non-diagonal: grid[1][0]=='s' -> matches non_diag_char='s'\n                   j=1: skip\n                   j=2: non-diagonal: grid[1][2]=='s' -> matches\n\n            i=2: j=0: skip, j=1: grid[2][1]=='s' -> matches, j=2: skip.\n\n        Then check: non_diag_char 's' != diag_char 'w' -> YES.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            3\n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: all 'a' -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: all 'a' -> ok.\n        Then check: grid[0][0]=='a' and grid[0][2]=='a' -> same.\n\n        Then non-diagonal: set non_diag_char to grid[0][1] which is 'a'. Then we check that all non-diagonal are 'a' (which they are). Then we check: non_diag_char 'a' == diag_char 'a' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition in the problem says \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n   In the example above, the non-diagonal letter is the same as the diagonal letter, so it fails.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: the non-diagonal letter must be different from the diagonal letter. So if the entire grid is the same letter, then the non-diagonal letter is the same as the diagonal letter -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox -> NO (because main diagonal has 'x','o','s','o','x' -> not uniform)\n\n        Example 2: \n            Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES\n\n        Example 3: \n            Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> NO (because main diagonal: ['x','x','e'] -> not uniform)\n\n   So we output:\n\n        NO\n        YES\n        NO\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem is:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   We are reading from stdin, so we can run the code and test.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We'll write the code as described.\n\n   One last optimization: the two list comprehensions for the diagonals might be heavy for n up to 300? But 300 is small, so it's acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the any() with generator expressions for early termination.\n\n   The current code uses:\n\n        if any(grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] for i in range(n)):\n\n   This will break at the first non-matching element.\n\n   Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n   So the code is efficient.\n\n   Let me write the final code.\n\n   Note: We assume the grid is n x n.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        if any(grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] for i in range(n)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        if any(grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1] for i in range(n)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check that the two diagonals have the same letter (by comparing the starting points, but actually the entire diagonals are already checked to be uniform, and the center is common so they must be the same)\n        if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        diag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        # Check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n        if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, note: the anti-diagonal check uses grid[0][n-1] as the reference. But what if the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter than the main diagonal? We already check that the entire anti-diagonal is uniform (so the first element is the same as the rest) but we don't check that the entire anti-diagonal is the same as the main diagonal. \n\n   But we did: \n        if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]: then NO.\n\n   However, note: the main diagonal is all grid[0][0] and the anti-diagonal is all grid[0][n-1]. So if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1], then the two diagonals are not the same. But wait, the center is the same for both? Actually, the center is grid[n//2][n//2] and must be in both diagonals. In the main diagonal we require grid[n//2][n//2] == grid[0][0]. In the anti-diagonal we require grid[n//2][n//2] == grid[0][n-1]. Therefore, if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1], then the center (grid[n//2][n//2]) must be both grid[0][0] and grid[0][n-1] -> impossible unless they are equal. \n\n   But wait, we have already checked that the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform. The center is part of both. So the center must be grid[0][0] (from main) and grid[0][n-1] (from anti). Therefore, we must have grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1]. \n\n   However, the above code checks that the entire main diagonal is grid[0][0] and the entire anti-diagonal is grid[0][n-1]. But note: the entire main diagonal being grid[0][0] and the entire anti-diagonal being grid[0][n-1] and the center being the same cell implies grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1]. \n\n   Therefore, the check \"if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]\" is redundant because the center cell must be both. But wait, what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but they are different? Then the center cell would have to be two different letters, which is impossible. So the condition is automatically satisfied by the grid? \n\n   Actually, no: the center cell is grid[n//2][n//2]. From the main diagonal, we have grid[n//2][n//2] == grid[0][0]. From the anti-diagonal, we have grid[n//2][n//2] == grid[0][n-1]. So if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then we must have grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1] (because the center cell is the same). \n\n   Therefore, the check \"if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]\" is redundant. We can remove it.\n\n   However, let me think: \n        We have already ensured that the main diagonal is all grid[0][0] and the anti-diagonal is all grid[0][n-1]. The center cell is in both, so grid[n//2][n//2] must be grid[0][0] and grid[0][n-1]. Therefore, grid[0][0] must equal grid[0][n-1]. \n\n   So the condition is automatically true. \n\n   But wait, what if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but the center is the same cell and the two diagonals have different letters? Then we have a contradiction. So the grid cannot exist. Therefore, we don't need to check separately.\n\n   However, our two previous checks (main diagonal and anti-diagonal) do not guarantee that the two diagonals are the same letter. They only guarantee that the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform. But the center forces the two diagonals to be the same. Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter. \n\n   But note: the main diagonal is uniform with letter A, the anti-diagonal is uniform with letter B, and the center is the same cell so A must equal B. Therefore, the entire anti-diagonal must be A (because the center is A, and the anti-diagonal is uniform). Similarly, the entire main diagonal is A.\n\n   Therefore, we don't need the third check.\n\n   However, let me test with:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = [\n            \"aaa\",\n            \"aaa\",\n            \"aaa\"\n        ]\n\n        Main diagonal: all 'a' -> uniform.\n        Anti-diagonal: all 'a' -> uniform.\n\n        Then the center is 'a', so the two diagonals are the same.\n\n        Now, change the anti-diagonal to be 'b'? \n\n        But wait, the grid must have the center cell as 'a' (from main diagonal) and also as 'b' (from anti-diagonal) -> impossible. So such grid cannot exist.\n\n        How would we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters in the grid must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal Uniformity**: Verify that all characters along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are identical.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal Uniformity**: Verify that all characters along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are identical.\n3. **Ensure Diagonals Have Same Letter**: The letters on both diagonals must be the same because they intersect at the center of the grid.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Uniformity**: All characters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nif any(grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] for i in range(n)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nif any(grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1] for i in range(n)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nnon_diag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        elif grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\nif non_diag_char == diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Main Diagonal Check**: The code checks each element along the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) to ensure they are all the same as the first element (`grid[0][0]`). If any element differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, the code checks each element along the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`) to ensure uniformity. If any element differs from `grid[0][n-1]`, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Diagonal Consistency**: The code implicitly ensures both diagonals have the same letter because the center element of the grid must satisfy both diagonals. Thus, the first elements of both diagonals must be equal.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then checks all elements not on the diagonals to ensure they are identical and different from the diagonal letters. If any non-diagonal element differs, it prints \"NO\". Finally, it confirms the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letter before printing \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required to form the letter \"X\" in the grid, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
