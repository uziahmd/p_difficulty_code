Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can assume that initially there were infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x.\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards (from the available infinite set) to add so that the total sum becomes 0.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n We need to make the total sum 0 by adding some cards. Each card we add must have an integer between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n We are allowed to use any card any number of times (since the initial set is infinite).\n\n However, note: we are not limited to the found cards, but we can only use numbers in the range [-x, x].\n\n We want the minimum number of cards to add.\n\n Observation:\n Let T be the total sum we need to achieve (which is 0). We currently have S, so we need to cover the deficit (or surplus) D = -S.\n\n Now, we can choose any numbers from the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x-1, x} to add. The problem becomes: what is the minimum number k such that we can write D as the sum of k numbers, each between -x and x?\n\n But note: we are free to choose any numbers (and repetitions are allowed) from the symmetric interval [-x, x].\n\n Actually, note that the set is symmetric. The maximum absolute value of a single card is x.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n 1. If S == 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we need to cover D = -S.\n\n How to minimize the number of cards? We can use the largest absolute value for each card to change the sum as much as possible.\n\n However, we cannot exceed the range. So the best we can do with one card is to use either x or -x (if we need to increase or decrease). But note, we are covering a deficit D which could be positive or negative.\n\n Actually, let D = -S. Then we need to form D with the minimum number of terms, each term in [-x, x].\n\n Since the set is symmetric, we can consider the absolute value of D. The maximum change we can get with k cards is k*x (if all are x, then we get k*x). Similarly, if we have negative D, then we can use negative cards.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to mix positive and negative. But the goal is to get exactly D.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let k be the number of cards we add. Then we need to check if there exists a sequence of k integers (each between -x and x) that sum to D.\n\n We are to find the minimum k.\n\n Constraints: |D| might be large? Note: n<=1000, x<=1000, and the found cards are in [-x,x]. So |S| <= 1000*1000 = 1000000.\n\n But note: D = -S, so |D| <= 1000000.\n\n However, k must be at least ceil(|D|/x) because the maximum absolute change per card is x. But also note: we cannot use fractional cards.\n\n But wait: we can use both positive and negative. Actually, the key is that we are allowed to use any combination. The necessary condition is that the total absolute value we can cover is at most k*x (in absolute value). However, we must be able to form D.\n\n However, there's a catch: we are not limited to positive or negative only. We can use both to adjust. But note: we are forming D, which may be positive or negative.\n\n Actually, we can think of it as: we have k cards, and we can assign each card a value in [-x, x]. The sum of these k cards must be D.\n\n This is equivalent to: \n   Let y_i = a_i (each a_i in [-x, x]), and we require sum_i a_i = D.\n\n Also note: the minimal k must satisfy that the total absolute change is at least |D|, and also the parity condition? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, the minimal k must be at least ceil(|D| / x). Why? Because the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x (if all are aligned). So we must have k*x >= |D|.\n\n However, we must also consider that we are working with integers and the possibility of using mixed signs. But note: even if we use mixed signs, the total absolute change is still constrained by k*x. Moreover, we cannot exceed k*x in absolute value.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. So the condition is that k must be such that k*x >= |D|, and also we can form D with k cards (with values in [-x,x]) if and only if |D| <= k*x and ... ?\n\n However, there is no further restriction? Actually, we can always form D with k cards if k*x >= |D| and k>=0? \n\n Why? Consider:\n\n  We can set one card to the value that is as close to D as possible without exceeding |value|<=x, and then adjust the rest to zero? But wait, zeros are allowed.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n    Let k_min = ceil(|D| / x)\n\n  Then, can we form D with k_min cards?\n\n  Example: D=5, x=2, then k_min = ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n  We can use two cards of 2 and one card of 1: 2+2+1=5. So yes.\n\n  But what about negative? Similarly.\n\n  However, consider D=5, x=2, and k=3. The maximum positive we can get is 6 (three 2's). We can represent any integer from -6 to 6 with three cards? Actually, not necessarily every integer? \n\n  Actually, we can represent any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] as long as k>=1? \n\n  But wait: with two cards and x=2, can we represent 3? Yes: 2+1. But wait, we can use any integers from -2 to 2. So with two cards, the possible sums are from -4 to 4. And we can get every integer in between? \n\n  Actually, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers between -k*x and k*x, but with some gaps? \n\n  Let me check: k=1 -> [-x, x] (all integers in between)\n          k=2 -> [-2x, 2x] but can we get every integer? \n            For example, x=2: \n                2+2=4, 2+1=3, 2+0=2, 2+(-1)=1, 2+(-2)=0, \n                1+1=2, 1+0=1, etc.\n\n            Actually, we can get every integer from -4 to 4 because the step is 1 (since we have consecutive integers). \n\n  In fact, since we have all integers from -x to x, the set of k-card sums is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x, and because the set of integers is contiguous and the step is 1, we can form every integer in that range.\n\n  Why? By the Coin Problem (Frobenius number) for multiple copies of a complete residue system? Actually, when we have consecutive integers from -x to x, then the generating set is symmetric and includes all residues modulo 1 (so no gaps). \n\n  Therefore, we can form D if and only if |D| <= k*x.\n\n  So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |D|.\n\n  However, wait: what if D=0? Then k=0, but we already handled S==0. So D=0 is handled.\n\n  But note: what if D is negative? Then |D| is positive, so same condition.\n\n  Therefore, the answer would be: \n      Let D = -sum(found_cards)\n      If D == 0: print(0)\n      Else:\n          k_min = ceil(|D| / x)\n\n  However, wait: the example input '2 3\\n-2 -2' has n=2, x=3, and the found cards are [-2,-2]. \n      Sum = -4, so D = 4.\n      Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2 -> matches the sample output.\n\n  But the first example: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n      n=3, x=2, found cards: [-1,1,2] -> sum = 2, so D = -2.\n      k_min = ceil(|-2|/2) = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> output 1, which matches.\n\n  However, wait: what if D is negative? Example: D=-5, x=2 -> |D|=5, ceil(5/2)=3. Then we need 3 cards. But 3*2=6 >=5, and indeed we can form -5: for example, -2, -2, -1 -> -5.\n\n  But wait, what if D is negative and we need to use negative numbers? The condition is symmetric.\n\n  However, there is a catch: what if the deficit D is very small but negative? Actually, our method uses |D|.\n\n  But wait: there is an alternative way. We might be able to use fewer cards if we consider that we can also use negative cards to reduce the total sum (if D is positive, then we need to add positive cards; if D is negative, we need to add negative cards). But note, the condition is the same: we need the total added sum to be D (which is negative if the current sum is too high). \n\n  So the above reasoning holds.\n\n  However, let me test with a negative D: \n      Suppose D = -3, x=2 -> |D|=3, ceil(3/2)=2. \n      Can we form -3 with 2 cards? \n        Each card in [-2,2]. We need two cards that sum to -3.\n        The smallest two cards are -2 and -1, which sum to -3. Yes.\n\n  Another: D=-4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=2. Two cards: -2 and -2 -> -4.\n\n  What about D=-5, x=2: ceil(5/2)=3 -> three cards: -2, -2, -1 -> -5.\n\n  So the formula seems to hold.\n\n  But wait: what if D=1, x=2: ceil(1/2)=1. One card: 1 is in [-2,2] so yes.\n\n  However, wait: what if D=1, but x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1, which is correct.\n\n  But what if D=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=2. But with two cards, the maximum positive we can get is 4 (two 2's). However, 3 is less than 4, so we can form 3: 2+1=3. Yes.\n\n  However, consider D=3, x=1: then ceil(3/1)=3. With three cards, each can be at most 1, so we can do 1+1+1=3. Correct.\n\n  But wait, what if D=3 and x=2: we did 2+1=3, which is two cards. But note that the set of available numbers is [-2,2]. The number 1 is allowed.\n\n  However, the above reasoning assumed that we can use any integer from -x to x. The problem states: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\"\n\n  So yes, we can use 1.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is:\n\n      Read n and x.\n      Read the list of n integers.\n\n      total = sum(list)\n      D = -total\n\n      If D == 0: print(0)\n      Else:\n          k = abs(D)\n          # We need the smallest integer k_min such that k_min * x >= abs(D)\n          # k_min = ceil(|D| / x) = (abs(D) + x - 1) // x   [if we do integer ceiling division]\n\n          But wait: if abs(D) is divisible by x, then ceil(|D|/x) = |D|//x, else (|D|//x)+1.\n\n          However, we can compute: k_min = (abs(D) + x - 1) // x   if we are using integer arithmetic, but note that if abs(D)==0 then k_min=0, but we already handled D==0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          k_min = abs(D) // x\n          if abs(D) % x != 0:\n              k_min += 1\n\n          But note: if abs(D) is 0, then k_min=0, which we handle separately.\n\n  However, wait: what if D is negative? Then we use |D|, so it's the same.\n\n  But wait, there's a catch: what if we can use negative cards to offset a positive deficit? Actually, no: the deficit D is defined as the amount we need to add. If the current sum is S, we need to add D = -S. \n\n  However, note: the cards we add can be positive or negative. The above condition (using |D|) is correct because the absolute value of the total added sum must be at least |D|, and the maximum absolute value we can add with k cards is k*x.\n\n  But wait: is that condition sufficient? We showed that if k*x >= |D|, then we can form D (because the set of achievable sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x). \n\n  Therefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|D|/x).\n\n  However, let me check with a different example: \n      D = 5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=2. But 2*3=6 >=5, so we can form 5? \n          Cards: two cards, each in [-3,3]. We need two numbers that sum to 5. \n          Maximum is 3+3=6, so 5 is possible: 3+2=5, and 2 is in the set. So yes.\n\n  But wait, what if D=5, x=2? Then ceil(5/2)=3, and we can form 5 with three cards (as above).\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          # We need to cover |d|\n          # k_min = ceil(|d| / x)\n          k_min = (abs(d) + x - 1) // x\n          # But wait: what if |d| is 0? Then we get 0, but we already handled d==0.\n\n          However, note: if d is negative, then |d| is positive, so same.\n\n          Print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: the above example with D=5 and x=3: \n        abs(d)=5, x=3 -> (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in integer floor division). That is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2, and (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2. Correct.\n\n  What if D=3, x=3: ceil(3/3)=1, (3+3-1)//3 = (5)//3 = 1 (since 5//3 is 1 in floor division). Correct.\n\n  However, wait: is this ceiling formula correct for positive integers?\n\n      ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive integers a and b.\n\n  But note: our a is |d|, which is nonnegative. And x is positive.\n\n  But wait: what if d is negative? Then |d| is positive. So it works.\n\n  However, wait: what if d is negative and we use |d|? Then we are computing the same as if d were positive.\n\n  But note: the condition is symmetric because the set is symmetric.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          # Compute k_min = ceil(abs_d / x)\n          # Using integer arithmetic: (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  But wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s = (-1+1+2)=2, d=-2, abs_d=2.\n        k_min = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, d=4, abs_d=4.\n        k_min = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit D is negative and large? Example: D=-1000, x=1000 -> ceil(1000/1000)=1. Correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if D=1000, x=1000 -> ceil(1000/1000)=1. Correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=999, x=1000? ceil(999/1000)=1, but 999<=1000, so one card of 999 is allowed? Yes, because 999 is in [-1000,1000]. So correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if D=1001, x=1000? Then ceil(1001/1000)=2, and 2*1000=2000>=1001, so we can form 1001 with two cards: 1000+1=1001, and 1 is in the set. Correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=1001, x=1000, and we use two cards: the set allows any integer from -1000 to 1000. So 1000+1=1001 is valid.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n  However, wait: I just realized that the above reasoning and formula work for positive D and negative D because we take absolute value. But note: the problem says the cards can be positive, negative, or zero, and the deficit D is the amount we need to add (which is -S). \n\n  There's no issue.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit D is not an integer? Actually, D is an integer because the found cards are integers and x is integer, so the deficit is integer.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says the found cards are integers (given as integers). So no issue.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit D is very large? The formula uses integer arithmetic and works for any integer D.\n\n  However, note: the constraints say n<=1000, x<=1000, so |D| <= 1000*1000 = 1000000, which is acceptable for integer arithmetic.\n\n  But wait: there's a twist. The problem does not require that we use the deficit D to be covered entirely by positive or negative cards. We are allowed to mix. But the above condition (k*x>=|D|) is necessary and sufficient because the set is contiguous.\n\n  However, wait: what if D is negative and we use positive cards? Actually, no: if the deficit is negative, that means the current sum is too high (positive) and we need to subtract (i.e., add negative numbers). But wait, the deficit D is defined as -S. \n\n  Example: current sum S is 5, then D=-5. We need to add cards that sum to -5.\n\n  But note: we can also use positive cards to cancel negative? No, because the goal is to get the total sum to zero. The current sum is 5, then we need to add cards that sum to -5.\n\n  However, we can also think: we are allowed to use any cards. The set is symmetric, so we can use negative cards to reduce the total.\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify that we must use only negative cards. We can use any cards. The deficit is fixed: we need to add a total of D.\n\n  So the sign of D tells us the direction: if D is positive, we need to add positive cards (at least) to compensate, and if negative, we need to add negative cards. But we can use both? Actually, no: if D is positive, then we must use at least some positive cards to get the positive sum, but we can also use negative ones to adjust? \n\n  Wait, no: we must have the total added sum equal to D. So if D is positive, then the sum of the added cards must be positive. But we can use negative cards to lower the total? That would be counterproductive. \n\n  Actually, no: if we use negative cards, then we are making the total even more positive? \n\n  Example: if D=5, and we use a card of 3 and a card of 2: that gives 5. If we use a card of 10, that would be too big, but we cannot use 10 because x is the maximum absolute value. \n\n  But wait, we cannot use 10 because the card must be at most x (in absolute value). \n\n  However, the point is: we are allowed to use any combination. The condition is that the sum of the added cards is D. \n\n  So if D is positive, then we must have the positive part of the added cards (the sum of positive cards) minus the negative part (the absolute value of the negative cards) equals D. \n\n  But note: the set is symmetric, so we can use negative cards only if we are forming a negative D. \n\n  Actually, no: the set is symmetric, but the deficit D can be positive or negative. \n\n  The above condition (k_min = ceil(|D|/x)) is independent of the sign of D. \n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  But wait: let me test with D=-1, x=2: then ceil(1/2)=1, and we can form -1 with one card (the card -1 is available). Correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if D=-1, x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1, and we can form -1 with one card. Correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=-1, x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n  Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n  However, wait: I just thought of another example: \n      D=0 -> handled by the if.\n\n  But wait, what if the deficit D is 0? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n  But wait, what if the deficit D is not zero, but we can use zero cards? Then we don't, but we need to cover D, so we must use at least one card.\n\n  The formula for k_min when D!=0 is the minimal number of cards.\n\n  However, note: there's an alternative way to look at it. The minimal k must satisfy two conditions:\n\n      Condition 1: k*x >= |D|\n      Condition 2: k must be at least 1 (if D!=0)\n\n  But our formula (ceil(|D|/x)) automatically gives at least 1 when D!=0 (unless |D|==0, which is handled).\n\n  Therefore, we are good.\n\n  But wait: what if |D| is 0? Then we don't enter the else, so we print 0.\n\n  So the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          # Calculate the minimal k such that k*x >= abs_d\n          # k_min = ceil(abs_d / x)\n          # Using integer arithmetic: (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit D is negative and very large? The same formula applies.\n\n  But wait, I just thought: what if D is negative, but we are allowed to use positive cards? \n\n  Example: D=-5, but we use two positive cards and one negative card? \n\n  Actually, no: the total added cards must sum to D=-5. So the entire set of added cards must sum to -5.\n\n  We cannot use positive cards to help if D is negative, because positive cards would make the total more positive, which is opposite of what we need.\n\n  However, wait: what if we use both positive and negative? \n\n  Example: D=-5, and we use a positive card and a negative card. Then the positive card increases the total and the negative card decreases. But we need the net to be -5.\n\n  But note: we can use any combination. \n\n  However, the condition is that the sum of the added cards must be -5.\n\n  We can use positive cards and negative cards as long as the total is -5.\n\n  But the maximum absolute value per card is x. \n\n  Example: D=-5, x=3. Then we can use two cards: one positive and one negative. For example, 1 and -6? But wait, we cannot use -6 because x=3 (so the absolute value must be <=3). \n\n  Actually, we can use two cards: \n      Option 1: two negative cards: -3 and -2 -> -5.\n      Option 2: one negative card and one positive card: for example, -3 and -2 (same as above) or maybe -3 and 0 -> -3, which is not enough. Or -3 and 1 -> -2, which is not enough. Or -3 and 2 -> -1, not enough. Or -3 and 3 -> 0, not enough.\n\n  So in this case, we cannot use a positive card. \n\n  But wait, the condition for forming D=-5 with two cards (x=3) is: we need two numbers a and b in [-3,3] such that a+b=-5.\n\n  The minimum sum we can get with two cards is -3 + -3 = -6, so -5 is achievable: for example, -3 and -2 (since -3-2=-5). \n\n  So the formula still holds.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n  However, wait: the above example shows that we can use negative cards to form a negative deficit. But we cannot use positive cards to form a negative deficit because positive cards would increase the total and we need to decrease it.\n\n  But note: we can use positive cards if we then use even more negative cards? \n\n  Example: D=-5, x=3, and we use two cards: one positive and one negative: \n      Let the positive card be p (0<=p<=3) and the negative card be n (n from -3 to 0). Then the total is p+n. We need p+n=-5.\n\n  Since p>=0 and n>=-3, then p+n >= -3. But we need -5, which is less than -3. So we cannot use positive cards in this case.\n\n  But wait, we can use more than two cards? Then we might use a positive card and then negative cards to compensate.\n\n  Example: D=-5, x=3, and we use three cards: \n      We can use one positive card and two negative cards: 3 + (-3) + (-5)? -> wait, we cannot use -5 because x=3 (so the absolute value must be <=3). \n\n  Actually, we can use: 3 + (-3) + (-5) is invalid because -5 is not allowed. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use: 1 + (-1) + (-3) = -3, which is not enough. Or 2 + (-1) + (-3) = -2, not enough.\n\n  Or use four cards: 2 + (-1)*4 = 2-4=-2, not enough.\n\n  Actually, the minimal number of cards is two, so we don't need to consider three.\n\n  Therefore, the condition is: the total absolute value we need to cover is |D|. The maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x. But note: we are not covering absolute values independently, but the entire deficit.\n\n  The condition k*x >= |D| is necessary and sufficient because the set of achievable sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=0? We handled that.\n\n  However, there's one more edge: what if the deficit D is positive and we use negative cards? \n\n  Example: D=5, and we use two cards: one negative and one positive? \n      Let a and b be the cards: a+b=5. We can use a negative card and a positive card. For example, -1 and 6? But 6 is not allowed if x=3. \n      But if x>=6, then we can use -1 and 6. But if x=3, then we cannot.\n\n  However, the condition is k*x>=|D|, so for D=5 and x=3, k_min=ceil(5/3)=2, and 2*3=6>=5, so it's valid. But how do we form 5 with two cards in the range [-3,3]? \n      We can use 3 and 2: 3+2=5. So we don't use negative cards.\n\n  The formula doesn't care about the sign, because the absolute value is what matters.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: the sample input format is given as a string in the example. But the problem reads from stdin.\n\n  Example input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n  Our code reads two integers in the first line and then the second line.\n\n  Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, arr = [-1,1,2]\n        s = 2, d = -2 -> abs_d=2, k_min = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (since 3//2 in integer division is 1). Output 1.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, arr = [-2,-2]\n        s = -4, d=4, abs_d=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2. Output 2.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  But wait: the problem statement says that the cards found are n numbers, and the initial set has all integers from -x to x. \n\n  However, note: the deficit D might be very large, but our formula handles it.\n\n  But wait, what if the deficit D is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n  I think we are done.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says the maximum absolute value of the number on a card is x. And we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x]. So the above condition holds.\n\n  Let me submit the code.\n\n  But wait, wait: there is a known issue.\n\n  Example: D=1, x=2 -> k_min=ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=5, x=2 -> ceil(5/2)=3. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=6, x=2 -> ceil(6/2)=3. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=7, x=2 -> ceil(7/2)=4. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=-1, x=1 -> ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=-2, x=1 -> ceil(2/1)=2. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=-3, x=1 -> ceil(3/1)=3. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=-4, x=1 -> ceil(4/1)=4. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=-5, x=1 -> ceil(5/1)=5. Correct.\n\n  Example: D=0 -> 0. Correct.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          # Ceiling division for positive integers: (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: what if x is 1? Then the set of cards is {-1,0,1}. Then the minimal k is ceil(|D|/1)=|D|.\n\n  Example: D=5, x=1 -> 5 cards: we can use five 1's? But wait, we need to form 5. With five 1's: 1+1+1+1+1=5. Correct.\n\n  But wait, we can also use zeros? Actually, zeros don't help. But the minimal k is |D| if x=1 and D is positive? \n\n  However, note: with x=1, the maximum absolute value per card is 1, so we need at least |D| cards (if we use all 1's or -1's appropriately). So ceil(|D|/1) = |D|, which is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if D=0? Then we output 0. Correct.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      d = -s\n\n      if d == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_d = abs(d)\n          k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: the problem says that the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. But the deficit D might be very large (up to 1000000) but that is acceptable because we are just doing integer arithmetic.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit D is negative and very large? Same.\n\n  We are good.\n\n  Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> outputs 1.\n  Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> outputs 2.\n\n  But wait, the example input is given as a string in the example. How do we read it? \n\n  The problem says: \n      The first line contains two integers: n and x.\n      The second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n  So we read the first line, then split and convert to integers",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. The cards can have any integer value from -x to x, and there are infinitely many cards available for each integer in this range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero. If the current sum of the found cards is S, then the deficit D is -S. We need to cover this deficit by adding cards whose values sum up to D. Each card's value can range from -x to x.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required to cover the deficit D is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of D divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards covering the deficit. For example, if D is 5 and x is 2, we need at least 3 cards (since 2*2 = 4 < 5, so we round up to 3).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the deficit D, then computing the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of |D| / x. If the deficit is zero, no cards are needed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves reading the input values and performing basic arithmetic operations, which are constant time operations. Thus, the time complexity is O(1), and the space complexity is also O(1) since we only store a few variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    s = sum(arr)\n    d = -s\n    \n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_d = abs(d)\n        k_min = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers (n and x) followed by a list of n integers representing the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The deficit D is then calculated as the negative of this sum.\n3. **Deficit Handling**: If the deficit D is zero, it means the sum of the found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed, and the output is 0.\n4. **Card Calculation**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of D divided by x. This is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic: `(abs_d + x - 1) // x`.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
