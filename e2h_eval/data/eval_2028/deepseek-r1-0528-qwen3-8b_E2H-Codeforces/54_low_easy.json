Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices, from 3 to 10^5) and a (the target angle, from 1 to 180 degrees).\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n However, note that the angle we are forming is at a vertex. There are two types of angles we can form:\n\n 1. The angle that is less than or equal to 180 degrees (the smaller one). But note: the problem does not specify that the angle must be the smaller one, but in a convex polygon, the angle at a vertex for the triangle formed by three distinct vertices must be an interior angle of the polygon? Actually, let's think:\n\n We are forming an angle with vertex v2 and two other distinct vertices v1 and v3. The angle can be measured by the turn from the direction to v1 to the direction to v3.\n\n However, note that in a convex polygon, the angle we form might be either the \"small\" angle (if the two points are adjacent in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction) or the reflex angle? But wait, the problem says \"the value |angle - a|\", and the angle is defined as the absolute difference.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\" -> output is \"2 1 3\", which is an angle of 45 degrees (from a square). Why? Because in the square, the angle formed by two adjacent sides is 90, but also we can form a 45 degree angle by taking two sides that are not adjacent.\n\n Actually, in the square (n=4), the central angle per side is 90 degrees. The angle we form at vertex 2 (if we take vertices 1,2,3) is the angle of the polygon at vertex 2, which is 90 degrees. But the example output for input \"4 67\" is \"2 1 3\", meaning the angle is 45 degrees.\n\n How do we get 45 degrees? Consider: from vertex 2, we go to vertex 1 and vertex 3. But wait, in a square, if we take two adjacent edges, the angle is 90. However, we can also consider taking two edges that are separated by one edge? \n\n Actually, the problem allows any three distinct vertices. So in the square, we can choose three vertices that are not consecutive. For example, in a square with vertices labeled 1,2,3,4 (clockwise):\n\n Option 1: vertices 1,2,3 -> forms a 90-degree angle at vertex 2.\n Option 2: vertices 1,2,4 -> then we have to compute the angle at vertex 2. The two vectors: from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. In the square, the vector from 2 to 1 is left, and the vector from 2 to 4 is down (if we assume the square is positioned with 1 at top-left, 2 top-right, 3 bottom-right, 4 bottom-left). Then the angle between these two vectors is 90 degrees again? Or wait, actually the angle at vertex 2 for the triangle 1-2-4 would be the same as the square's internal angle? No, because the triangle is formed by three vertices, and the angle at vertex 2 is the angle between the sides (2,1) and (2,4). But in the square, the sides of the square at vertex 2 are (2,1) and (2,3). The side (2,4) is the diagonal.\n\n Alternatively, we can think in terms of the circle. The regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. The angle at vertex 2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3. The angle at the circumference is half the central angle subtended by the same arc? But wait, that's for a circle theorem. However, note: the angle we are measuring is the angle at vertex 2, and the two sides are chords. The angle can be computed using the central angles.\n\n However, there is an easier way. In the regular n-gon, the entire circle is 360 degrees. The central angles are multiples of (360/n). The angle at vertex 2 (which is on the circumference) for the chord from 2 to v1 and from 2 to v3 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain 2. But note: the problem does not require the angle to be the one from the polygon's side, but just three distinct vertices.\n\n Actually, we can use the following idea:\n\n Let the polygon be inscribed in a circle. Then the angle at vertex 2 (which is on",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given target angle (a). The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of the polygon to efficiently determine the optimal vertices without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex polygon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\) degrees. The angle formed at any vertex (v2) by two other vertices (v1 and v3) can be derived from the arcs between these vertices. The angle at v2 is determined by the smaller arc between v1 and v3, which must be less than or equal to 180 degrees for the angle to be valid.\n\n2. **Insight**: The angle at vertex v2 can be calculated using the formula involving the central angles. Specifically, if the arc between v1 and v3 spans k sides, the angle at v2 is \\( 180 - \\left(\\frac{360}{n} \\times k\\right) \\). This formula helps in determining the angle for any triplet of vertices.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which is computationally expensive for large n), we recognize that the closest angle will likely be either just above or just below the target angle a. We can compute the required number of sides (k) for both scenarios (angle slightly larger and slightly smaller than a) and then select the corresponding vertices.\n\n4. **Optimization**: By calculating the optimal k values for both directions around the target angle, we can directly map these k values to vertices in the polygon. This approach ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(1) for each test case, making it suitable for large n (up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n\n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n\n    total_central_angle = 360 / n\n    base_angle = 180 - total_central_angle\n\n    if a > base_angle:\n        k = round((base_angle - a) / (total_central_angle))\n        k_neg = k - 1\n        k_val = k + 1\n        k_candidate = [k_val, k_neg]\n    else:\n        diff = base_angle - a\n        k_val = round(diff / total_central_angle)\n        k_neg = k_val + 1\n        k_candidate = [k_val, k_neg]\n\n    best_k = None\n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n\n    for k in k_candidate:\n        if k < 0:\n            continue\n        angle_val = base_angle - k * total_central_angle\n        angle_diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if angle_diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = angle_diff\n            best_k = k\n\n    k_final = best_k\n    angle_val = base_angle - k_final * total_central_angle\n\n    if k_final == 0:\n        v2 = 1\n        v1 = 2\n        v3 = 3\n        print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n    else:\n        v2 = 1\n        v1 = 1 + k_final\n        v3 = 1 + k_final + 1\n        if v3 > n:\n            v3 -= n\n        print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: For a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so it directly outputs vertices 1, 2, and 3.\n3. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between adjacent vertices is calculated as \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\).\n4. **Angle Determination**: The base angle (180 - central angle) is used to determine the closest angles around the target angle a. The algorithm checks angles slightly larger and smaller than a by adjusting the number of sides (k) between the vertices.\n5. **Vertex Selection**: Based on the optimal k value, the corresponding vertices are selected.
