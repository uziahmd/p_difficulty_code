Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of went out candles needed to make a new one)\n We start with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour. When we burn a candle, we get one used candle.\n Additionally, we can combine 'b' used candles to make one new candle.\n\n The process:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n But note: we can use the burned ones (leftover) to create more candles.\n\n However, we can simulate:\n\n   hours = 0\n   while current_candles > 0:\n        hours += current_candles   # because we burn all current candles for 'current_candles' hours\n        # Then we have current_candles + leftover from previous burns, but note: we are going to collect the used candles from burning the current ones (which is current_candles) and any leftover from before?\n        # Actually, let's think: when we burn a candle, we get one used candle. So we have:\n        #   total_used = current_candles + leftover   [but wait, we haven't collected the leftovers from previous cycles?]\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them, so we get 'a' hours and then we have 'a' used candles.\n   Then we can make floor(a / b) new candles and have a % b leftover used candles.\n\n   Then the next cycle: we have floor(a / b) new candles (which we can burn) and we still have the leftover.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that Vasily acts optimally. He burns as many as he has, then recycles the used ones.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let:\n     total = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   But actually, we can do:\n\n     total += current   # burning the current candles gives current hours\n     leftover += current   # we now have leftover used candles from these current candles\n     Then, we can form new_candles = leftover // b\n     And update leftover = leftover % b\n     Then set current = new_candles\n\n   Then repeat until current becomes 0.\n\n   Example: a=4, b=2\n     Start: current = 4, leftover = 0, total=0.\n     Step1: \n        total += 4 -> total=4\n        leftover += 4 -> leftover=4\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2, leftover %= 2 -> 0\n        current = 2\n     Step2:\n        total += 2 -> total=6\n        leftover += 2 -> leftover=2\n        new_candles = 2//2=1, leftover=0\n        current=1\n     Step3:\n        total +=1 -> total=7\n        leftover+=1 -> leftover=1\n        new_candles = 1//2=0, leftover=1\n        current=0 -> break.\n\n   So output 7.\n\n   Another example: a=6, b=3\n     Step1: \n        total=6, leftover=6\n        new_candles = 6//3=2, leftover=0\n        current=2\n     Step2:\n        total=6+2=8, leftover=2\n        new_candles=2//3=0, leftover=2\n        current=0 -> break.\n\n   Output 8.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Read the input line, split into two integers: a and b.\n\n   Then simulate until current becomes zero.\n\n   However, note: we might have an infinite loop if we don't break condition. But when current becomes less than b, then the next new_candles will be 0 and leftover won't change, so we break.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        leftover += current\n        current = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n\n   Then print(total)\n\n   Let me test with a=1, b=2: \n        total=0, current=1, leftover=0.\n        Step1: total=1, leftover=1; current = 1//2 = 0 -> breaks. Output 1. Correct.\n\n   Another: a=10, b=5\n        Step1: total=10, leftover=10 -> current=10//5=2, leftover=0.\n        Step2: total=10+2=12, leftover=2 -> current=2//5=0 -> break. Output 12.\n\n   But wait, let's think: \n        Burn 10 candles ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle used candles into new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the used ones until no more candles can be made.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (a) and the number of used candles needed to make a new one (b).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: \n   - **Burning Candles**: Each candle burns for one hour, so the total hours increase by the number of candles burned.\n   - **Recycling Used Candles**: After burning, each used candle can be combined with others to form new candles. The number of new candles is calculated by dividing the total used candles by b, and the remainder becomes leftover used candles.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn (i.e., when the current number of candles becomes zero).\n\nThis approach efficiently models the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total = 0\n    current = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        leftover += current\n        current = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, a (initial candles) and b (used candles needed per new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total` (accumulated hours), `current` (current candles to burn), and `leftover` (collected used candles) are initialized to zero.\n3. **Loop Execution**: \n   - **Burning Phase**: The current candles are burned, adding their count to `total` hours.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The used candles from the burned ones are added to `leftover`. New candles are formed by dividing `leftover` by `b`, and the remainder is stored back in `leftover`.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when `current` becomes zero, meaning no more candles can be made or burned.\n5. **Output**: The total accumulated hours (`total`) is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
