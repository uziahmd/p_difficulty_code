He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2*n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). We know that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the input order is arbitrary. We have to assign each string either as 'P' or 'S' such that:\n - There is one prefix and one suffix for each length (from 1 to n-1).\n - The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string s of length n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n How to think?\n We are guaranteed that the strings are either prefixes or suffixes of some string of length n. Also, for each length L (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings of that length: one prefix and one suffix.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the given strings by their length. Since there are two strings for each length, we will have two strings per length (from 1 to n-1).\n\n 2. Now, we need to decide for each string (in each group) whether it is a prefix or a suffix.\n\n 3. However, the consistency condition: \n    Let the full string be s of length n.\n    Then, for a prefix p of length L, we must have p = s[0:L].\n    For a suffix q of length L, we must have q = s[n-L:n].\n\n 4. Consider two strings of the same length, say L. One is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But note: they are from the same string s. Therefore, the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must have the first character of the suffix equal to the last character of the prefix? Not necessarily, because they are from different parts.\n\n However, consider if we have two strings of length 1: say [a, b]. Then the full string must start with one and end with the other. So the full string must have the first character as the prefix and the last as the suffix, but note: the prefix and suffix could be the same? Actually, the problem states that the given strings are the prefixes and suffixes. And they are distinct? Not necessarily: the example \"2\\na\\nc\" has two distinct letters. What about the second example: \n     Input: 3\n            a\n            aa\n            aa\n            a\n     Here, there are two 'a' and two 'aa'. \n\n Important: the two strings of the same length might be the same? Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\". \n\n Example: for n=3, string \"aaa\" has:\n   prefixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n   suffixes: \"a\", \"aa\"\n\n So indeed, the same string can appear as both a prefix and a suffix (if the string is symmetric in that way). \n\n Therefore, we cannot rely on distinctness.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have to assign for each string (each given string) either P or S, such that:\n   - For each length L (from 1 to n-1): exactly one string is marked as P and one as S.\n\n But note: what if two strings of the same length are identical? Then we have two possibilities: \n   Option 1: mark both as P and S? But wait, there must be one P and one S. However, if they are the same, then we must mark one as P and the other as S. But then, how does that affect the full string?\n\n However, there's a catch: the full string must be consistent. That is, if we have a prefix of length L and a suffix of length L, then the first L characters of the full string must equal the prefix, and the last L characters must equal the suffix.\n\n Now, consider two strings of the same length L: let them be A and B (which could be equal). We have two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: A is prefix and B is suffix.\n Possibility 2: B is prefix and A is suffix.\n\n But what if A == B? Then Possibility 1 and Possibility 2 are the same. Then the condition for the full string is that the first L characters and the last L characters are both A. This is consistent if the full string starts and ends with A, and the middle part (if any) doesn't matter.\n\n However, note: the full string must be of length n. The condition for the entire string is that the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters. \n\n But if we have two identical strings of length L, then we mark one as P and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves grouping the strings by their lengths and then using consistency checks between these groups to assign the correct labels ('P' for prefix and 'S' for suffix).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n2. **Check Consistency Between Groups**: For each length `L`, we compare the strings in that group with strings from other groups. Specifically, we check if the last `L` characters of any potential prefix (from the prefix group) match the first `L` characters of any potential suffix (from the suffix group). This ensures that the combined string formed by the prefix and suffix would be consistent.\n3. **Assign Labels**: Once consistent pairs are found, we assign 'P' or 'S' to each string based on their roles. If no such pair is found initially, we swap the assignments and recheck until consistency is achieved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        L = len(s)\n        if L < n:\n            if L not in groups:\n                groups[L] = []\n            groups[L].append(s)\n    \n    prefix_group = {}\n    suffix_group = {}\n    for L in groups:\n        if len(groups[L]) != 2:\n            continue\n        a, b = groups[L]\n        # We don't know which is prefix and which is suffix yet.\n        # We'll try both ways.\n        # Assume a is prefix and b is suffix: then the full string would start with a and end with b.\n        # Similarly, assume b is prefix and a is suffix.\n        prefix_group[L] = [a, b]\n        suffix_group[L] = [b, a]\n\n    result = []\n\n    def is_consistent():\n        for L in range(1, n):\n            p1, p2 = prefix_group[L]\n            s1, s2 = suffix_group[L]\n            # Check if the two strings in the same group are the same?

The first line specifies the length `n` of the unknown string.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where each key is a length, and the value is a list of strings of that length.\n3. **Initial Assignment**: For each length, the two strings are tentatively assigned as prefix and suffix.\n4. **Consistency Check**: The algorithm checks if the current assignment of prefixes and suffixes can form a valid string. This involves verifying that the suffix's end matches the prefix's start when combined.\n5. **Adjustment**: If inconsistency is found, the assignment for the conflicting length is swapped, and the check is repeated until consistency is achieved.\n6. **Output Generation**: Once consistent, the algorithm generates the output string by appending 'P' or 'S' for each input string based on their roles.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, handling all edge cases where strings might be identical or partially overlapping in their definitions.",
