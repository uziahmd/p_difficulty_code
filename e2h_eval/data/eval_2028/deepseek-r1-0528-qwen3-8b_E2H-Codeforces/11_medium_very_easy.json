A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Then, the maximum number of toasts that can be made from the drink is: total_drink // (nl * n) \n    But wait: actually, each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend? \n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n This means: for one toast, we need:\n   - Drink: n * nl (because there are n friends, each requiring nl milliliters)\n   - Lime: 1 slice (per toast, and each toast is for one friend? Actually, the toast is per friend, so if we have t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts and therefore each friend uses t * nl ml and t slices of lime and t * np grams of salt.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. So if a friend makes t toasts, he uses t * nl ml, t slices, and t * np grams.\n\n Therefore, the entire group's requirement for t toasts is:\n   - Drink: t * n * nl\n   - Lime: t * n * 1   [but wait, the example: 3 friends, so for t=2 toasts per friend, we need 3*2=6 slices? However, the example says: \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". \n\n Let me break down the example:\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n   n=3, k=4, l=5 -> total_drink = 20 ml\n   Each toast requires for one friend: 3 ml. But note: the toast is defined per friend? Actually, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So one toast (by one friend) uses 3 ml.\n\n   However, the entire group making t toasts (each friend making t toasts) would use 3 * t * n ml? Actually, no: the requirement for the entire group for t toasts (meaning each friend makes t toasts) is:\n        Drink: t * n * nl   [because each of the n friends makes t toasts, and each toast for a friend requires nl ml]\n        Lime: t * n * 1     [each toast for a friend requires one slice, so each friend uses t slices -> total slices = n * t]\n        Salt: t * n * np\n\n But wait, the example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n Here, they are considering the drink per toast (for the whole group?): Actually, they say 20 ml / 3 ml per toast (for the entire group? or per friend?) \n\n Let me read the example again: \n        \"the friends have 20 milliliters, which is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n But note: the example does not specify if the toast is for the entire group or one friend. However, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. \n\n In the example: nl = 3 (from the input: 7th number is 3). So one toast requires 3 ml for one friend. But then the entire group making one toast (each friend having one toast) would require 3 * n ml. \n\n However, the example calculation: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. This 6 must be the total number of toasts (across all friends) because 20 ml is the total available drink, and each toast (regardless of the number of friends) requires 3 ml? \n\n Let me clarify: \n\n The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n This implies that if we are making T toasts (and each toast is for one friend) then we need:\n   - Drink: T * nl   [because each toast (one friend's toast) requires nl ml]\n   - Lime: T * 1\n   - Salt: T * np\n\n But wait, how many toasts can we make in total? Then the entire group can make T toasts, but note: if we have n friends, then the same toast cannot be shared by multiple friends? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs ... for a toast\", meaning that each friend must have their own toast. Therefore, the total number of toasts T must be at least the number each friend makes, and all friends must make the same number.\n\n However, note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" and output: 2.\n\n How is 2 obtained?\n\n According to the example explanation:\n\n   total_drink = 4 * 5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if we consider that each toast requires 3 ml, and the toast is for one friend).\n\n   But wait, the example says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\".\n\n   Why divide by 3? Because there are 3 friends. \n\n   So the example is treating the toasts as being allocated per friend. The entire group can only make as many toasts as the limiting factor (after dividing the limiting resource by the number of friends?).\n\n   Actually, the example breaks down:\n\n   - From drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if each toast requires 3 ml for one friend). But since there are 3 friends, the total number of toasts (for the entire group) cannot exceed 6, but also each friend can only make the same number. So the total toasts must be divisible by the number of friends? Not necessarily, but the condition is that each friend makes the same number.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\" \n\n   So we are to find the maximum integer t (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n        Total drink needed: t * n * nl <= k * l\n        Total lime needed: t * n * 1 <= c * d   [because each lime gives d slices, so total slices is c*d]\n        Total salt needed: t * n * np <= p\n\n   Then, the maximum t (toasts per friend) is the minimum of:\n\n        (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        (c * d) // n   [because we need n * t slices, and we have c*d slices] -> actually, wait: the condition for lime is: we need t * n slices (since each friend uses t slices). So the maximum t is (c*d) // n? \n\n   But wait: the example says the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. \n\n   Let me reinterpret the example's lime part: \n        They have 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices -> 80 slices.\n        Each toast (for one friend) requires 1 slice. Therefore, the total number of toasts (across all friends) is limited by the lime slices. But the entire group's total toasts is t * n (if each friend makes t toasts). \n\n   However, the example says: \"min(6, 80, 100)\".\n\n   What are these numbers?\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if we consider that one toast requires 3 ml and the toast is for one friend). But note: if we do 6 toasts (total), then each friend can have 6 / 3 = 2 toasts? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n        Let T be the total number of toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then:\n\n            Drink: T * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k * l) / nl\n            Lime: T <= c * d\n            Salt: T * np <= p         => T <= p / np\n\n        Then the maximum T is the minimum of (k*l)//nl, (c*d), (p)//np (using integer division, but note: we can only make whole toasts).\n\n        Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, we have T = t * n, where t is the number per friend.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum t (toasts per friend) is floor(min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) / n) ?\n\n   But wait, the example: \n        T_max from drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> floor is 6 (if we use integer division) but the example uses 6.\n        T_max from lime: 80\n        T_max from salt: 100\n\n        Then T_max = min(6, 80, 100) = 6.\n\n        Then t = T_max / n = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n   However, note: the condition for drink is: T * nl <= total_drink -> T <= (k*l) / nl. But in this case, the drink condition is for the entire group: T toasts (each toast being one friend's toast) requires T * nl ml.\n\n   But wait, the example says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So for T toasts (each friend making t toasts, so T = n*t toasts) the drink required is T * nl = n*t*nl.\n\n   And the example calculation for drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (this 6 is the total toasts, i.e., T). \n\n   Therefore, the three constraints for T (total toasts) are:\n\n        T <= (k * l) // nl   [if we use integer division, but actually we are allowed to use fractional toasts? No, we use integer division for the maximum integer T]\n\n        Actually, we should use:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // nl   -> but wait, the condition is T * nl <= k * l, so T <= (k * l) / nl. Since T must be an integer, we take floor((k * l) / nl). However, note that the drink condition is for the entire group: T * nl <= k * l.\n\n        Similarly, T_lime = c * d   (because we have c*d slices, and each toast requires 1 slice, so T <= c*d)\n\n        T_salt = p // np   (because T * np <= p, so T <= p / np, and we take floor(p/np))\n\n   Then the maximum T is the minimum of these three values.\n\n   Then, the number of toasts per friend is T // n (because T must be divisible by n? Actually, no: we can have T = n * t, but T might not be divisible by n? However, we are to find the maximum t (integer) such that n*t <= T_max. \n\n   But note: the condition is that each friend must make the same number, so we can only use multiples of n. However, the total toasts T must be at most T_max, and T = n * t. So t = floor(T_max / n) ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [because the drink requirement for one toast (for one friend) is nl, and for n friends making one toast each (so total n*nl) is one full round? Actually, no: we are counting the total toasts T (which is n*t) and the drink condition is T * nl <= k * l -> n*t * nl <= k * l -> t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n        Similarly, t_lime = (c * d) // n   [because we need n*t slices, and we have c*d slices, so n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d)/n]\n\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)   [because we need n*t * np grams of salt, so t <= p/(n*np)]\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\n   Let me test with the example:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n        t_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        t_lime = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n        t_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n        Then the answer is min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Now, let's check the second example: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        t_drink = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n        t_lime = (1*19) // 5 = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19//5 is 3 in integer division)\n        t_salt = 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n        Answer = min(50, 3, 6) = 3.\n\n   The example output is 3.\n\n   Third example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        t_drink = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n        t_lime = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n        t_salt = 1 // (10*1) = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        Answer = 0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t_lime = (c * d) // n\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n        Then, answer = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n   However, note: we must use integer division (floor division) and ensure that we are not dividing by zero. But the problem states that all integers are at least 1, so n and the denominators (n * nl, n * np) will be at least 1.\n\n   But wait: what if the denominator is larger than the numerator? Then we get 0, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n   Let me write the code:\n\n   Example: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> 2\n   Example: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> 3\n   Example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> 0\n\n   Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   if not data:\n        # But the problem says positive integers, so we assume there is data.\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        l = int(data[2])\n        c = int(data[3])\n        d = int(data[4])\n        p = int(data[5])\n        nl = int(data[6])\n        np = int(data[7])\n\n        # Calculate the three limits\n        # Drink: total_drink = k * l, and each toast (for the entire group) requires n * nl? \n        # Actually, wait: no. We have two ways:\n\n        # Way 1: Consider T (total toasts) as the total number of toasts (each toast for one friend). Then:\n        #   Condition: T <= (k * l) / nl   (because each toast requires nl ml, and there are T toasts)\n        #   Then the number of toasts per friend is t = T // n (if T is the total, then T must be divisible by n? Actually, we can have T = n * t, and the condition becomes: n * t * nl <= k * l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl) -> so we can compute t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)\n\n        # But note: the example did this.\n\n        # However, let me double-check the drink condition: \n        #   The entire group is making T toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then the drink consumed is T * nl. We have k*l ml. So T <= (k*l) // nl (using integer division) is not the same as t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl). \n\n        # Actually, we can express T = n * t, so the drink condition is: n * t * nl <= k * l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). \n\n        # Similarly, the lime condition: we need T * 1 = n*t slices, so n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d) / n -> t_lime = (c*d) // n\n\n        # Salt condition: n*t*np <= p -> t <= p/(n*np) -> t_salt = p // (n*np)\n\n        # So we are correct.\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t_lime = (c * d) // n\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n        ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n        print(ans)\n\n   However, wait: what if the drink condition is calculated differently? \n\n   Alternative view: \n        The drink condition: we have k*l ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml. So the total number of toasts we can make (without considering the group) is (k*l) // nl. But then we have to account for the fact that the same toast is for one friend, and we have n friends. \n\n   But note: the total toasts must be divisible by n? Actually, no: the condition is that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So the total toasts T must be a multiple of n? \n\n   However, the problem does not require that the total toasts is a multiple of n? It requires that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So T must be at least n*t and we are to maximize t. \n\n   But the way we did above (by computing t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)) is correct because:\n\n        The drink required for t toasts per friend is: n * t * nl.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n   But note: there's another way: the total toasts T must be <= (k * l) // nl, and also T must be a multiple of n (or at least, we are going to set t = T/n, so T must be at least n*t and we take the maximum t such that n*t <= (k*l)//nl and n*t <= c*d and n*t*np <= p.\n\n   However, the above calculation of t_drink is the maximum t from the drink condition.\n\n   But wait: consider the drink condition without the group: the maximum total toasts (across friends) is (k*l) // nl. Then the maximum toasts per friend is floor( (k*l) // nl / n )? \n\n   Let me compare:\n\n        Option A: t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)\n\n        Option B: total_toasts = (k*l) // nl   (maximum total toasts)\n                  then t = total_toasts // n\n\n   Are these the same?\n\n        Example 1: \n            Option A: (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n            Option B: total_toasts = 20 // 3 = 6; then t = 6 // 3 = 2 -> same.\n\n        Example 2: \n            Option A: (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n            Option B: total_toasts = 1000 // 4 = 250; then t = 250 // 5 = 50 -> same.\n\n        Example 3: \n            Option A: (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n            Option B: total_toasts = 1000000 // 50 = 20000; then t = 20000 // 10 = 2000 -> same.\n\n        Why are they the same? \n\n        Because: \n            Option A: t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl) = floor((k*l) / (n*nl))\n\n            Option B: total_toasts = (k*l) // nl = floor((k*l) / nl)\n                     t = floor(floor((k*l) / nl) / n)\n\n        But note: \n            floor((k*l) / (n*nl)) = floor( (k*l) / (n*nl) )\n            and floor((k*l) / nl) / n might not be the same as floor((k*l) / (n*nl)) because of integer division.\n\n        However, observe:\n\n            floor(a / b) / c  (with integer division) is not the same as floor(a / (b*c)) in general.\n\n        But wait, let me test with a=20, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: floor(20 / (3*3)) = floor(20/9) = 2\n\n            Option B: floor(20/3)=6, then floor(6/3)=2.\n\n        Now, let me test with a=21, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: floor(21/9)=2\n            Option B: floor(21/3)=7, then floor(7/3)=2.\n\n        Now, a=19, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: floor(19/9)=2\n            Option B: floor(19/3)=6, then floor(6/3)=2.\n\n        Now, a=8, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: floor(8/9)=0\n            Option B: floor(8/3)=2, then floor(2/3)=0.\n\n        Now, a=9, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 9//9 = 1\n            Option B: 9//3=3, then 3//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=10, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 10//9=1\n            Option B: 10//3=3, then 3//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=11, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 11//9=1\n            Option B: 11//3=3, then 3//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=12, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 12//9=1\n            Option B: 12//3=4, then 4//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=13, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 13//9=1\n            Option B: 13//3=4, then 4//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=14, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 14//9=1\n            Option B: 14//3=4, then 4//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=15, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 15//9=1\n            Option B: 15//3=5, then 5//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=16, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 16//9=1\n            Option B: 16//3=5, then 5//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=17, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 17//9=1\n            Option B: 17//3=5, then 5//3=1.\n\n        Now, a=18, b=3, c=3:\n\n            Option A: 18//9=2\n            Option B: 18//3=6, then 6//3=2.\n\n        So both methods give the same result.\n\n        Why? \n\n        Because: \n            floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))   ?\n\n        Actually, we have to be cautious. Consider:\n\n            floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))   is not always true.\n\n        Counterexample: a=5, b=2, c=3\n\n            Option A: floor(5/(2*3)) = floor(5/6)=0\n            Option B: floor(5/2)=2, then floor(2/3)=0 -> same.\n\n        Another: a=7, b=2, c=3\n\n            Option A: floor(7/6)=1\n            Option B: floor(7/2)=3, floor(3/3)=1 -> same.\n\n        But wait, let me try with non-divisible:\n\n            a=5, b=2, c=3: same.\n\n        How about a=10, b=3, c=2:\n\n            Option A: 10 // (3*2) = 10//6=1\n            Option B: 10//3=3, then 3//2=1 -> same.\n\n        It seems to hold. Actually, we can prove:\n\n            Let x = floor(a/b) and y = floor(x/c). Then we have:\n\n                x = floor(a/b) => x <= a/b < x+1\n                Then, y = floor(x/c) => y <= x/c < y+1\n\n            Also, note that a >= b*x and a < b*(x+1)\n\n            Then, a/(b*c) >= x/c and a/(b*c) < (x+1)/c.\n\n            Now, if we let z = floor(a/(b*c)), then z <= a/(b*c) < z+1.\n\n            We want to show y = z.\n\n            Since x = floor(a/b), then a/b - 1 < x <= a/b.\n\n            Then, x/c <= a/(b*c) and (x+1)/c > a/(b*c) ?\n\n            Actually, we know that x <= a/b < x+1, so:\n\n                x*c <= a/b * c < (x+1)*c   =>   (x*c)*b <= a < (x+1)*c*b   [but wait, we multiplied by b which is positive]\n\n            But we are comparing with a/(b*c): \n\n                We know: x*c <= a/(b) * c  => but that doesn't directly help.\n\n        However, note: we are doing integer division and the examples matched. And the problem constraints are positive integers.\n\n        But wait, there is a known identity: floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c)) is true when a, b, c are positive integers? \n\n        Let me try with a=5, b=3, c=2:\n\n            Option A: floor(5/(3*2)) = 5//6 = 0\n            Option B: floor(5/3)=1, then floor(1/2)=0 -> same.\n\n        Another: a=6, b=3, c=2:\n\n            Option A: 6//6=1\n            Option B: 6//3=2, 2//2=1 -> same.\n\n        Another: a=7, b=3, c=2:\n\n            Option A: 7//6=1\n            Option B: 7//3=2, 2//2=1 -> same.\n\n        So it appears that for positive integers a, b, c:\n\n            floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))\n\n        Why? \n\n            We have: \n                floor(a/b) = q, so q <= a/b < q+1.\n\n            Then, q/c <= a/(b*c) < (q+1)/c.\n\n            Now, since q is an integer, floor(q/c) is the greatest integer less than or equal to q/c.\n\n            And note that:\n\n                a/(b*c) is between q/c and (q+1)/c.\n\n            Then, the floor of a/(b*c) is either floor(q/c) or floor(q/c)+1? \n\n            Actually, consider: \n                Let r = a mod b, so a = b*q + r, 0<=r<b.\n\n                Then, a/(b*c) = (b*q + r)/(b*c) = q/c + r/(b*c)\n\n            Then, the floor of a/(b*c) is floor(q/c + r/(b*c)).\n\n            Since r/(b*c) < 1 (because r < b, so r/(b*c) < 1/c <= 1), we have:\n\n                floor(q/c + r/(b*c)) = floor(q/c) + floor(r/(b*c) + {fractional part}) \n\n            But note: q/c might not be an integer. \n\n            Actually, we can use:\n\n                floor(a/(b*c)) = floor( (b*q + r) / (b*c) ) = floor( q/c + r/(b*c) )\n\n            Now, 0 <= r/(b*c) < 1/c <= 1 (if c>=1). \n\n            Then, floor(q/c + r/(b*c)) is either floor(q/c) or floor(q/c)+1.\n\n            Specifically, it is floor(q/c) if {q/c} + r/(b*c) < 1, and floor(q/c)+1 otherwise.\n\n            But note: we don't know if {q/c} + r/(b*c) >= 1.\n\n            However, we have an alternative representation: \n\n            We know that a = b*q + r, and q = floor(a/b). \n\n            But we are trying to relate floor(a/(b*c)) to floor(q/c).\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the property of integer division: \n\n            We are doing: (a // b) // c = a // (b*c)   ?\n\n            Actually, in Python, integer division is floor division. And it is known that for positive integers, floor division satisfies:\n\n                (a // b) // c == a // (b*c)   is not always true.\n\n            Counterexample: a=5, b=2, c=2\n\n                5//2 = 2, then 2//2=1.\n                5//(2*2)=5//4=1 -> same.\n\n            a=7, b=3, c=2:\n\n                7//3=2, 2//2=1.\n                7//(3*2)=7//6=1 -> same.\n\n            a=8, b=3, c=2:\n\n                8//3=2, 2//2=1.\n                8//6=1 -> same.\n\n            a=9, b=3, c=2:\n\n                9//3=3, 3//2=1.\n                9//6=1 -> same.\n\n            a=10, b=3, c=2:\n\n                10//3=3, 3//2=1.\n                10//6=1 -> same.\n\n            a=11, b=3, c=2:\n\n                11//3=3, 3//2=1.\n                11//6=1 -> same.\n\n            a=12, b=3, c=2:\n\n                12//3=4, 4//2=2.\n                12//6=2 -> same.\n\n            Now, a=1, b=2, c=3:\n\n                1//2=0, 0//3=0.\n                1//6=0 -> same.\n\n            So it seems that for positive integers, (a//b)//c == a//(b*c) is true.\n\n        But wait, the identity: floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c)) holds for positive integers.\n\n        Therefore, we can also compute:\n\n            t_drink_alt = (k * l) // nl // n   # This is the same as (k*l) // (n*nl) because (k*l)//nl is an integer and then divided by n.\n\n        However, the original method is more direct.\n\n   Conclusion: both methods are equivalent.\n\n   But note: in our problem, we have two different conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: Drink: total toasts T (each toast for one friend) must satisfy T * nl <= k * l. Then T <= (k*l) // nl (using floor division). Then the per-friend toasts t = T // n (but we want the maximum t such that n*t <= T_max, so t = (k*l) // (nl*n) is the same as T_max = (k*l) // nl, then t = T_max // n, which is the same as (k*l) // (nl*n) because of the identity).\n\n        Condition 2: Lime: T <= c*d, then t = (c*d) // n.\n\n        Condition 3: Salt: T * np <= p, so T <= p // np, then t = (p // np) // n, which is the same as p // (n*np) because of the identity.\n\n   So the code remains.\n\n   However, note: the identity holds for positive integers, so we can use either method.\n\n   We'll stick to the direct computation for clarity.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n        # Compute the three limits for the number of toasts per friend.\n        # For drink: (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        # For lime: (c * d) // n\n        # For salt: p // (n * np)\n\n        t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t2 = (c * d) // n\n        t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n        print(min(t1, t2, t3))\n\n   But wait, the example: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> \n        t1 = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        t2 = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n        t3 = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n        min(2,26,33)=2 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: the example says the drink condition is 20/3=6 toasts (total",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves determining the bottleneck resource that limits the number of toasts.\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts per friend is constrained by the most limiting resource among the drink, lime slices, and salt. For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts possible per friend:\n   - **Drink**: Total milliliters divided by the product of the number of friends and milliliters per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total slices (from all limes) divided by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total grams divided by the product of the number of friends and grams per toast.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations to compute the three constraints and then selecting the smallest value among them, which represents the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = (c * d) // n\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each friend requires `nl` milliliters per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Each lime provides `d` slices, so total slices are `c * d`. Each friend requires one slice per toast, leading to `(c * d) // n` toasts per friend.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each friend requires `np` grams per toast, resulting in `p // (n * np)` toasts per friend.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The smallest value among the three constraints determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring no resource is exceeded. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic operations to determine the solution, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for the given problem constraints.",
