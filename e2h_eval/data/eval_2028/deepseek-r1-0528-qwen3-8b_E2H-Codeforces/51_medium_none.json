Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the combined letters of the first two names (guest and host) can be rearranged to form the pile of letters.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines.\n 2. Concatenate the first two lines (guest's name and host's name) and remove any spaces (if present) and convert to uppercase (though input is uppercase as per problem, but just in case).\n 3. The third line is the pile of letters; similarly remove spaces and convert to uppercase for consistency.\n 4. Check if the sorted list of the concatenated string (without spaces) of the first two names is equal to the sorted list of the third line.\n 5. If they are equal, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the example inputs are given with '\\n' at the end of each line. We should strip or handle that.\n\n Alternatively, we can read the lines and then remove any whitespace.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\n', 'DEDMOROZ\\n', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n But note: the example input format is three lines. The sample input provided in the example is given as a list of strings, but actually the input will be three separate lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example 1:\n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   But wait: the example output says \"YES\", so they must have the same multiset of letters.\n\n   However, note: the example input string for the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me count:\n\n   Combined: \n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> let's break down:\n        S:2, A:2, N:2, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, A:2? Actually, let's count again without assuming:\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n        s1 = ''.join(input().split()) for each line.\n\n   But note: the example input has newline characters. We can use .strip() or simply read and remove spaces and newlines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So there might be no spaces, but there could be newline characters at the end.\n\n Since the input is from standard input, we can read the lines and then strip them.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   guest = input().strip().replace(' ', '')\n   host = input().strip().replace(' ', '')\n   pile = input().strip().replace(' ', '')\n\n But note: the problem says the input has only uppercase Latin letters, so we don't have to worry about lowercase.\n\n However, the example input string is given with '\\n' in the array representation, but when reading from stdin, the newlines are included.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the example input in the problem statement is provided as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n Actually, wait: the problem says the input consists of three lines. So we'll read three lines.\n\n Example 1: \n   Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\\n\"\n   Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\\n\"\n   Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n We want to process each line.\n\n Steps:\n\n   guest_name = input().strip()\n   host_name = input().strip()\n   pile_letters = input().strip()\n\n   Then combine_guest_host = guest_name + host_name\n\n   Then check if sorted(combine_guest_host) == sorted(pile_letters)\n\n But wait: what if there are duplicate letters? Sorting will take care of that.\n\n However, let's test with example 1:\n\n   combine_guest_host = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Let me write the sorted version of \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Actually, note: the example says the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", but the expected combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". \n\n   Are these two the same?\n\n   Let me break down:\n\n   Combined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n   Pile:     SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Wait, these are different strings. But note: the example output is \"YES\", meaning they are anagrams.\n\n   Actually, let me count the letters:\n\n   Combined: \n        S:2, A:3, N:2, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Pile: \n        S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:2, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Wait, the pile has T:1? But the combined has T:2. \n\n   Actually, let me recount the combined:\n\n   SANTACLAUS: \n        S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, A: (already 2), C:1, L:1, U:1, S: already 1 -> total S:2? \n        Actually, let me write:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: \n            S:1 (at start), then at the end: S:1 -> total 2.\n            A: appears at index1 and index5 -> 2.\n            N: index2 and index6 -> 2.\n            T: index3 -> 1? Wait, no: SANTA -> S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, then CLAUS: C:1, L:1, A:3, U:1, S:2 (so S becomes 2, A becomes 3).\n\n        So SANTACLAUS: \n            S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n        Then add DEDMOROZ:\n            D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n        Now total: \n            S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   Now the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:2, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   So the counts match. But wait, the combined has T:1 and the pile has T:1? Then why did I think the combined had T:2?\n\n   Correction: In SANTACLAUS, T appears only once (the fourth letter). Then in DEDMOROZ, no T. So indeed T:1.\n\n   Then why did I think the combined had T:2? I must have miscounted.\n\n   Now, the pile: \n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n        Break down: \n            S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:2, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   And the combined: \n        S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   They are the same.\n\n   So the method of sorting the two strings should work.\n\n   However, note: the example input for the third line is given as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", but the example output says \"YES\".\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   But note: the second example:\n\n        Input: \n          PAPAINOEL\n          JOULUPUKKI\n          JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: \"NO\"\n\n   Let's check:\n\n        Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count the letters:\n\n        Combined: \n            P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        Pile: \n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        There is a mismatch: \n            Combined has P:3, but pile has P:1 -> so not matching.\n\n        Also, Combined has L:1, but pile has L:2.\n\n        Therefore, it's clear.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        Input: \n          BABBONATALE\n          FATHERCHRISTMAS\n          BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Expected: \"NO\"\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Let me count the letters in the combined and the pile.\n\n        Combined: \n            B:3, A:4, B: already 3, O:1, N:1, T:2, A:4, L:1, E:1, F:1, H:1, T:2, E:1, R:1, C:1, H: already 1, R: already 1, I:1, S:1, M:1, A:4 already, S:1 already, T:2 already, etc.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count the letters:\n\n        Combined: \n            B:3, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, L:1, E:2, F:2, H:2, R:2, C:1, S:2, I:1, M:1\n\n        Pile: \n            B:2, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, L:2, E:2, F:2, H:2, R:2, C:1, S:2, I:1, M:1\n\n        The pile has one extra 'L' (so L:2 in pile, L:1 in combined) and missing one 'B' (B:2 in pile, B:3 in combined). \n\n        Actually, wait: \n            Combined: \n                BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\n                Let's break down the B's: \n                    BABBONATALE -> B:2 (from \"BA\" and \"BB\")? Actually: \n                    BAB (B:2) then BONATALE (no B) -> so B:2? Then FATHERCHRISTMAS: \n                    FATHER: no B, CHRISTMAS: no B -> so total B:2? \n\n                Then the combined has B:2? \n\n            Let me write the combined string: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            The first part: \"BABBONATALE\" -> \n                B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> wait, that's 3 B's? Actually, the first word is \"BABBONATALE\": \n                B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> so 3 B's.\n\n            The pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n                BAB: 2 B's, then ... so total B's: 2 in BAB, then later: BONATALLEFATHER -> one more B? \n                Actually, the pile: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n                We see: BAB (2 B's) and then later: BONATALLEFATHER -> the 'B' in BONA -> that's a third B.\n\n            Wait, but the example output is \"NO\", and the note says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n            Let me count the letters without relying on breakdown:\n\n            Combined: \n                B: count('B') -> 3\n                A: count('A') -> 4\n                O: 1, N:1, T:2, L:1, E:2, F:2, H:2, R:2, C:1, S:2, I:1, M:1\n\n            Pile:\n                B:3, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, L:2, E:2, F:2, H:2, R:2, C:1, S:2, I:1, M:1\n\n            So the pile has an extra 'L' (L:2 vs L:1) and is missing nothing? Actually, wait: \n            The combined has 3 B's and the pile has 3 B's. But the combined has L:1 and the pile has L:2.\n\n            So the pile has an extra 'L'. \n\n            However, the example output says \"NO\", and the note says \"there's an extra letter 'L'\", so that's correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input third sample is given as:\n\n            ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        And the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n        So the method of comparing sorted strings would catch this because the two strings (combined and pile) would have different lengths if there's an extra letter? \n\n        Actually, the combined length: len(\"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\") = 20 + 16 + 11? Let me count:\n\n            BABBONATALE -> 11\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS -> 14\n            Total: 25\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> \n            BABCHRISTMAS -> 11, BONATALLE -> 9, FATHER -> 6 -> total 11+9+6 = 26? \n\n        Alternatively, we can just compare the sorted lists: if the sorted lists are the same, then the multiset is same.\n\n        But note: the example input third sample has the pile as \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", which has 26 letters, while the combined has 25. \n\n        So the sorted list of the combined (25 letters) and the pile (26 letters) will be of different lengths, hence not equal.\n\n        Similarly, the second example: \n            Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" -> 11 + 12 = 23 letters.\n            Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> 15? Actually, let me count: \n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> \n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> 19 letters? \n                Actually, the problem says the third line is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which is 18 characters (without spaces). \n\n            The combined is 23, so the pile has fewer? Actually, the example says the pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which is 18 letters, and the combined is 23, so 23 != 18 -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example input for the second sample is:\n\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        The pile is the third line: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which is 18 letters, and the combined is 23. So we can also check the lengths first.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\"\n\n        This means:\n            - The pile must contain exactly the letters of the two names (so no extra and no missing).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if sorted(guest_name + host_name) == sorted(pile_letters):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But note: the input might have spaces. We are stripping and removing spaces. Also, the problem says the input contains only uppercase letters, but there might be newline characters.\n\n        We'll read the lines and remove any non-alphabet character? Actually, the problem says only uppercase Latin letters, but the newline is not a letter. So we should remove it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read the lines and then remove any whitespace.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the example input is given with '\\n' at the end of each line, but when reading from stdin, we get the newline as part of the string. We can use .strip() to remove leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            line1 = input().strip()\n            line2 = input().strip()\n            line3 = input().strip()\n\n        Then:\n\n            s1 = line1 + line2\n            s2 = line3\n\n            if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let's test with the first example:\n\n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n            s2 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            But wait, these two strings are of different lengths? \n\n            s1: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> 14 letters? \n                S A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z -> 17 letters? Actually:\n\n                SANTACLAUS: 10 letters (S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S -> 10)\n                DEDMOROZ: 8 letters -> total 18.\n\n            s2: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n                S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 17 letters?\n\n            Wait, let me count:\n\n                SANTAMOROZ: 10 letters? S-A-N-T-A-M-O-R-O-Z -> 10\n                DEDCLAUS: 8 letters? D-E-D-C-L-A-U-S -> 8\n                But wait, the example pile is written as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 10+8=18 letters.\n\n            Actually, the example input for the pile is written as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 18 letters.\n\n            So both s1 and s2 are 18 letters.\n\n            Now, if we sort s1 and s2, they should be the same.\n\n        But wait, I thought earlier the counts matched. \n\n        However, note: the example input representation was given as:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n        But when we read, we are stripping the newlines, so that's okay.\n\n        But wait, the example input string for the pile in the first sample is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 18 letters.\n\n        And the combined is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", which is also 18.\n\n        Now, we must ensure that the sorting considers the frequency.\n\n        Let me write a helper to count the letters for the first example:\n\n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n            s2 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            We can count the letters in s1 and s2.\n\n            s1: \n                S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n            s2:\n                S:2, A:3, N:2, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:2, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n            They are the same.\n\n        Therefore, the sorted lists will be identical.\n\n        However, note: the order of letters in the sorted list doesn't matter.\n\n        Let me test in Python:\n\n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n            s2 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            sorted_s1 = sorted(s1)\n            sorted_s2 = sorted(s2)\n\n            Then compare.\n\n        But wait, the example input for the third sample:\n\n            guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> 11 letters\n            host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> 14 letters\n            pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> 26 letters\n\n            Then the combined length is 11+14=25, and the pile is 26 -> so they are of different lengths. The sorted lists will have different lengths and thus not equal.\n\n        Similarly, the second sample:\n\n            guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> 9\n            host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> 10\n            pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> 18\n\n            Combined length: 19, pile length: 18 -> not equal.\n\n        So we can rely on the sorted comparison.\n\n        But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the combined string is at most 200, which is acceptable to sort.\n\n        Code:\n\n            guest = input().strip().upper()  # though the problem says uppercase, but just in case\n            host = input().strip().upper()\n            pile = input().strip().upper()\n\n            s1 = guest + host\n            s2 = pile\n\n            if len(s1) != len(s2):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        Alternatively, we can skip the length check because if the lengths are different, the sorted lists will be different. But the length check is cheap and might avoid the sort when the lengths differ.\n\n        However, the problem says the input has only uppercase letters, so we don't need the upper() conversion if the input is guaranteed uppercase.\n\n        But the problem says: \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\", so we can skip the upper(). But to be safe, we can leave it or not.\n\n        Since the problem states the input condition, we can assume they are uppercase.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as a list of strings including '\\n'. But when reading from stdin, we get the lines as they are. We are using .strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline).\n\n        This should work.\n\n        Let me run the examples:\n\n        Example 1:\n\n            guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            s1 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (18 letters)\n            s2 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" (18 letters)\n\n            sorted(s1) == sorted(s2) -> True -> YES.\n\n        Example 2:\n\n            guest = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            host = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            s1 = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" (19 letters)\n            s2 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" (18 letters) -> NO.\n\n        Example 3:\n\n            guest = \"BABBONATALE\"\n            host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            s1 = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" (25 letters)\n            s2 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" (26 letters) -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example input for the third sample is given as:\n\n            ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        When we strip, we remove the newlines, so the length of s2 is 26.\n\n        However, the example input representation might have been including the newline? But we are using .strip() so we remove the newline.\n\n        But note: the example input representation in the problem is given as a string that includes the newline. However, when reading from stdin, the newline is part of the line if we don't use .strip(). But the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives the input as a list of strings. But in reality, we are reading from stdin.\n\n        We'll assume the input is given as three lines, and we use .strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline at the end).\n\n        This should be standard.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            guest = input().strip()\n            host = input().strip()\n            pile = input().strip()\n\n            s1 = guest + host\n            s2 = pile\n\n            if len(s1) != len(s2):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, we can also do without the length check because if the lengths are different, the sorted lists will have different lengths and the condition fails. But the length check is efficient and avoids unnecessary sorting.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if sorted(guest+host) == sorted(pile):\n\n        This would also work, but it sorts even if the lengths are different. But the length check is very cheap, so we can leave it.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say the length of each line <= 100, so the combined string is <=200, and the pile is <=100? Wait, the problem says \"the length of each line does not exceed 100\", so the pile is one line and its length <=100, and the combined is two lines, so <=200.\n\n        However, if the two names together are 200, and the pile is 100, then the sorted(s1) will be 200, and sorted(s2) is 100, and they are not equal. But the length check will quickly say no.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile... The length of each line does not exceed 100.\"\n\n        So the pile is at most 100, and the two names together are at most 200. But note: the pile must be exactly the letters from the two names, so the pile must be of the same length as the two names combined.\n\n        Therefore, the pile cannot be longer than 200, but the problem says the pile is one line and its length <=100. So if the two names together are 200, and the pile is 100, then we immediately know it's NO.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the third line (the pile) has length at most 100, so if the two names together are 200, then the pile (being 100) is shorter, and we can output NO.\n\n        So the above code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example inputs in the problem statement are given with the pile being the same length as the two names combined.\n\n        But the problem does not guarantee that the pile is the same length as the two names? It says the length of each line does not exceed 100, meaning the guest name, host name, and pile are each <=100. So the two names together are <=200, but the pile is <=100. \n\n        Therefore, if the two names together are 200, the pile (<=100) is too short. But wait, the problem says \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters\", meaning the pile must be exactly the two names. \n\n        So the pile must have the same length as the two names combined.\n\n        But if the two names combined is 200, then the pile must be 200. However, the problem says the pile is a line and its length <=100, so if the two names are 200, then the pile cannot be 200 (because 200>100). Therefore, in such cases we would output \"NO\" because the pile is too short.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the length of each line (each of the three) does not exceed 100. So if the two names together are 200, that violates the input condition? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The length of each line does not exceed 100\". So the guest name is at most 100, the host name is at most 100, and the pile is at most 100.\n\n        Therefore, the two names together are at most 200, but the pile is at most 100. So the pile must be the same length as the two names? Only if the two names together are <=100. Otherwise, if the two names together are >100, then the pile (being <=100) is shorter -> NO.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify that the two names together must be <=100, but each line (including the pile) is <=100. So the two names together can be up to 200, but the pile is only up to 100, so if the two names together are 100 or more, then the pile (which is <=100) must be less than or equal to 100, and the two names together are 100 to 200, so the pile is shorter.\n\n        Therefore, we can rely on the length check.\n\n        Let me adjust the code to consider the input constraints: each line <=100, so the pile is <=100, and the two names together are <=200.\n\n        But note: the pile must be the same multiset as the two names. So the pile must be of the same length as the two names.\n\n        Therefore, if the two names together are longer than 100 (which is allowed by the input constraint for the names) but the pile is limited to 100, then the pile is too short.\n\n        Example: \n            guest = 100 'A's\n            host = 100 'B's\n            pile = 100 'A's -> then the two names together require 200 letters, but the pile is only 100, so we output NO.\n\n        So the above code is correct.\n\n        We'll submit the code as below.\n\n        Note: The problem examples are within the constraints.\n\n        Code:\n\n            guest = input().strip()\n            host = input().strip()\n            pile = input().strip()\n\n            if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                # Check the multiset\n                if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait, the length condition is the same as `len(guest)+len(host) != len(pile)`. We can use that.\n\n        However, the problem says the input is three lines, and we are reading three lines. We are stripping, so we are using the actual content.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host=\"DEDMOROZ\", pile=\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n            len(guest)=10, len(host)=8, len(pile)=18 -> 18==18 -> then check sorted.\n\n        Example 2:\n            guest=\"PAPAINOEL\" (9), host=\"JOULUPUKKI\" (10), pile=\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" (18) -> 9+10=19, 19!=18 -> NO.\n\n        Example 3:\n            guest=\"BABBONATALE\" (11), host=\"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" (14), pile=\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" (26) -> 11+14=25, 25!=26 -> NO.\n\n        But wait, example 3: the pile is given as \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", which is 26 letters? Let me count:\n\n            B A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R\n\n            Actually, the example input is given as: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me break it down:\n\n                BABCHRISTMAS -> 11\n                BONATALLE -> 8\n                FATHER -> 6\n\n            But wait, the entire string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", so:\n\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n                B,A,B,C,H,R,I,S,T,M,A,S,B,O,N,A,T,A,L,L,E,F,A,T,H,E,R\n\n            Count the letters: \n                B:3, A:5, ... \n\n            Actually, I think the example input representation might have been incorrect. But according to the problem, the example output is \"NO\".\n\n        However, the example output is provided as \"NO\", so our code outputs \"NO\" because 11+14=25 !=26.\n\n        But wait, the example input for the third sample in the problem is:\n\n            ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        And the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n        But note: the example note says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\". \n\n        So the pile has one extra letter. Our length check catches that.\n\n        Therefore, we are good.\n\n        However, what if the two names together are 100, and the pile is 100, but the letters don't match? Then the length condition passes and we do the sorted check.\n\n        Example:\n\n            guest = \"A\"*50\n            host = \"B\"*50\n            pile = \"A\"*50 + \"B\"*50   -> but wait, that would be 100, but the pile is 100, but the multiset: 50 A's and 50 B's, same as the two names.\n\n        But wait, the two names are \"A\"*50 + \"B\"*50? Actually, the two names are two separate strings: guest is \"A\"*50, host is \"B\"*50, so the combined is \"A\"*50+\"B\"*50, which is 100.\n\n        The pile is \"A\"*50+\"B\"*50, then sorted(guest+host) = sorted(\"A\"*50+\"B\"*50) = ['A']*50 + ['B']*50, and sorted(pile) is the same.\n\n        So it would output \"YES\".\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But what if the two names together are 100, and the pile is 100, but the multiset is different?\n\n            guest = \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. This involves checking two main conditions: the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names, and there should be no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Length:** Compare the length of the combined names with the length of the pile. If they differ, immediately output \"NO\" since it's impossible for the pile to match the combined names if their lengths are different.\n4. **Check Letter Counts:** If the lengths match, sort both the combined names and the pile. If the sorted strings are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, so output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_length = len(guest) + len(host)\n    if total_length != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    s1 = guest + host\n    s2 = pile\n    \n    if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines from standard input, representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters. Each line is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Length Check:** The combined length of the guest's and host's names is compared to the length of the pile. If they are not equal, the answer is \"NO\" because the pile cannot possibly match the required letters.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison:** The combined names and the pile are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted strings match, it confirms that the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, hence the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions by leveraging sorting to compare letter counts, ensuring correctness while maintaining simplicity.",
