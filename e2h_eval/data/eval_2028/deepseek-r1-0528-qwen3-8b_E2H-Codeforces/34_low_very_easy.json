And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait: the example says \"then the result is\" and then they don't show the overall average?\n Let me read the problem again: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n How many weeks? n-k+1 weeks. So we have to compute the sum of sleep hours for each week and then take the average of those weekly sums.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   Weeks: [3,4] -> sum=7, [4,7] -> sum=11.\n   Total weeks: 2, so average = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n   Weeks: only one week [10] -> sum=10, then average = 10/1 = 10.\n\n And the third example: \n   Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n   There are 7 weeks (since 8-2+1=7). We need to compute the sum for each consecutive two days and then average these 7 weekly sums.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". But wait, if we consider each week separately, then we are averaging the weekly totals. \n\n But note: the problem says \"consider k consecutive days as a week\", and then \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\". \n\n This means: \n   total_sleep = (sum of all sleep in all days) * (k) ? No, because each week is defined by k consecutive days, but the same day can appear in multiple weeks?\n\n Actually, no: the weeks are consecutive and non-overlapping? Wait, the example with k=2 and n=3: \n   Week1: day1 and day2\n   Week2: day2 and day3\n\n So the same day (day2) appears in two weeks. \n\n But note: the problem says \"k consecutive days\", and then \"there will be n-k+1 weeks\". This is overlapping windows.\n\n Now, how do we compute the average?\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep_in_weeks = (sum of the first week) + (sum of the second week) + ... \n\n But note: the entire data set is used, and each week is a contiguous segment of k days.\n\n We can precompute the prefix sum array to quickly get the sum of any segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that each day i (from index 0 to n-1) appears in exactly (k - i) weeks? Actually, let's check:\n\n   For day i (0-indexed), it appears in the first week starting at index 0, then at index 1, ... until the last week that includes it is when the week starts at index i (if i<=n-k) and then also if the week starts after i? \n\n Actually, the week starting at j must satisfy: j <= i <= j+k-1. So j from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that:\n\n   Let S be the total sum of all weeks.\n\n   Then, S = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_k}) + ... \n\n   We can also write:\n\n   S = a0 * (number of weeks containing a0) + a1 * (number of weeks containing a1) + ... \n\n   For a0: it is contained only in the first week (if k>=1). So count0 = 1 if k>=1, but actually the first element is included in the first (k) weeks? Actually, no: the first element is included in the first (k) weeks? \n\n   Actually, the first element a0 is included in the first (k) weeks? \n\n   Actually, let me reframe:\n\n   The week starting at index j includes days j to j+k-1.\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous segment of `k` days from the sequence of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each such week and then averaging these sums across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of `n` days where each week is a contiguous block of `k` days. There are `n - k + 1` such weeks. For each week, we need to compute the sum of sleep times and then find the average of these sums.\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each week from scratch (which would be inefficient for large `n`), we use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array `pref` where `pref[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each starting index of a week (from 0 to `n - k`), use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the next `k` elements. Summing these values gives the total sleep time across all weeks.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves:\n   - Building the prefix sum array in O(n) time.\n   - Calculating the sum for each week in O(n) time using the prefix sum array.\n   - The overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n up to 2*10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    pref = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks <= 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        start_index = i\n        end_index = i + k\n        s = pref[end_index] - pref[start_index]\n        total_sum += s\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of each week `k`, and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: The `pref` array is constructed such that `pref[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Total Weeks Calculation**: The number of weeks is `n - k + 1`. If there are no valid weeks (i.e., `k > n`), the result is 0.\n4. **Summing Week Sums**: For each week starting at index `i`, the sum of sleep times is computed as `pref[i+k] - pref[i]`. These sums are accumulated into `total_sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is `total_sum` divided by the number of weeks. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging prefix sums to avoid recalculating sums for overlapping subarrays, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
