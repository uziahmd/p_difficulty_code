Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Conditions:\n   Two vouchers i and j must have total duration = x (i.e., (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x)\n   They must not intersect: either voucher i ends before voucher j starts (r_i < l_j) or voucher j ends before voucher i starts (r_j < l_i)\n\n Steps:\n   1. We note that the total duration is x, so if we let d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1), then we need two vouchers i and j such that d_i + d_j = x.\n\n   2. We cannot try all pairs because n can be up to 200,000.\n\n Approach:\n   We can preprocess the vouchers by grouping them by duration. But note: there could be multiple vouchers with the same duration.\n\n   Let's create a dictionary (or list) for durations. However, we also need to consider the non-overlapping condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   We want to find two vouchers (i, j) such that:\n      d_i + d_j = x\n      and the intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not overlap.\n\n   We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Idea: For each voucher i (with duration d_i), we are looking for a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i, and such that the two intervals do not overlap.\n\n   But how to check non-overlap? \n        Condition: either r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n   However, we have two conditions. But note: the two vouchers are symmetric. So we can fix one and look for the other.\n\n   But we have two possibilities for the order: which one comes first in time? Actually, the non-overlap condition is independent of order.\n\n   However, we can split the problem by considering the two cases separately? But note: the two vouchers might be taken in any order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, a list of vouchers (each voucher being (l, r, cost)) and then for each duration d, we store the vouchers that have that duration.\n\n   Then, for each voucher i with duration d_i, we look for a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i. Then we need to check if they don't overlap.\n\n   But checking all pairs for a fixed duration d_i and d_j would be too expensive.\n\n   We need a more efficient way.\n\n   Let's reorganize the data:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute an array for each possible duration (from 1 to 200000, since ri, li up to 200000) but note: x can be up to 200000, and the maximum duration is 200000.\n\n   However, we don't know which durations will appear. We can use a dictionary for the durations.\n\n   But note: the total duration must be x, so we only care about durations d and x-d.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Let's create a dictionary `vouchers_by_duration` that maps a duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for every voucher with that duration.\n\n   Then, for each voucher i (we can iterate over all vouchers) with duration d, we look for duration d2 = x - d.\n\n   But then how to quickly check non-overlap? \n\n   The non-overlap condition is: \n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j   OR   Condition 2: r_j < l_i.\n\n   This is equivalent to the two intervals not having any common point.\n\n   However, we can break the problem by considering the two intervals independently and then combining.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Instead of iterating over all vouchers, we can precompute for each duration d, and then for each voucher of duration d, we can store information that allows us to quickly query the best voucher (lowest cost) that does not overlap with the current one.\n\n   But wait, we have two conditions: the two vouchers must not overlap. \n\n   We can try to precompute two separate structures:\n\n   Since the non-overlap condition is defined by the intervals, we can also think about ordering by time.\n\n   However, note: we are only concerned with two specific durations (d and x-d). And we want to minimize the total cost.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Group by duration.\n\n   2. For each duration d, we have a list of intervals (l, r, cost). We can sort these intervals by l (or by r) and then for a given interval [l_i, r_i] from the other group (duration x-d) we can check against the stored intervals of duration d.\n\n   But note: the condition is either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i. \n\n   Actually, we can split the problem into two cases:\n\n   Case 1: The voucher with duration d ends before the voucher with duration x-d starts.\n        Then we require: r_i < l_j.\n\n   Case 2: The voucher with duration x-d ends before the voucher with duration d starts.\n        Then we require: r_j < l_i.\n\n   However, the two vouchers are symmetric, so we can consider both orders.\n\n   But note: the two durations might be different. So we have two groups: group A (duration d) and group B (duration x-d).\n\n   Then, we want to consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use a voucher from A and a voucher from B such that the A voucher ends before the B voucher starts.\n\n   Option 2: Use a voucher from B and a voucher from A such that the B voucher ends before the A voucher starts.\n\n   But actually, these two options are symmetric. However, we can handle both by storing the two groups separately.\n\n   How?\n\n   For a fixed pair (d, x-d):\n\n   We have two sets: set_A (all vouchers with duration d) and set_B (all vouchers with duration x-d).\n\n   We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j, subject to either:\n        (a) r_i < l_j   (voucher i from set_A, j from set_B) OR\n        (b) r_j < l_i   (voucher j from set_B, i from set_A)\n\n   But note: the condition (a) is independent of (b). Actually, we can consider two separate cases:\n\n   Case 1: Use set_A as the first voucher and set_B as the second, then condition (a): r_i < l_j.\n\n   Case 2: Use set_B as the first voucher and set_A as the second, then condition (b): r_j < l_i.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify order. So we can also consider:\n\n   In Case 1: We are using a voucher from set_A and then set_B. But the non-overlap condition is defined without order. Actually, the condition (a) requires that the entire set_A voucher ends before the set_B voucher starts. Similarly, condition (b) requires the entire set_B voucher ends before the set_A voucher starts.\n\n   But note: the condition is symmetric. So we can do:\n\n   For each duration d, let d2 = x - d.\n\n   Then, we want to combine set_A (duration d) and set_B (duration d2) with the condition that the two intervals do not overlap.\n\n   How to efficiently combine?\n\n   We can do:\n\n   For set_A, we can sort by r (the end day) and then for set_B, we can sort by l (the start day). Then for a voucher in set_A, we want to find a voucher in set_B with l > r_A (condition a) and then take the minimum cost in set_B for that condition.\n\n   Similarly, for condition b: set_B sorted by r and set_A sorted by l, then for a voucher in set_B, we want a voucher in set_A with l > r_B.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute two dictionaries: \n        `by_duration`: mapping duration -> list of (l, r, cost)\n\n   Step 2: For each duration d from 1 to 200000 (or just the ones that appear) and for d2 = x - d (if d2 exists and d2>=1) then process the two sets.\n\n   But note: d and d2 must be positive and d <= x-1 (so d2>=1). Also, we must avoid processing the same pair twice (if d != d2) and if d==d2, then we are using two vouchers from the same set.\n\n   However, the problem says two distinct vouchers, but they can be of the same type (same duration). So we must allow that.\n\n   But note: if d == d2, then we are taking two vouchers from the same duration. Then we have to ensure they don't overlap. But in that case, we are effectively having two separate sets for the same duration? Actually, we can use two different vouchers from the same duration.\n\n   However, we can still use the same method: for set_A (which is the same as set_B) we need to consider both conditions: \n        Condition a: r_i < l_j (for two different vouchers in set_A) and similarly condition b: r_j < l_i.\n\n   But note: condition a and condition b are the same when the two intervals are from the same set? Actually, condition a is \"voucher i ends before voucher j starts\", and condition b is \"voucher j ends before voucher i starts\". These are two distinct conditions. \n\n   So for the same duration, we can have two different ways to combine two vouchers from the same set.\n\n   However, we can handle both conditions by:\n\n        For condition a: Sort set_A by r, and then for each voucher (l, r, cost) in set_A, we want to query the minimal cost in set_A for a voucher (l2, r2, cost2) such that l2 > r (because the next voucher must start after r). But wait, condition a: the first voucher (which is from set_A) must end before the second voucher (from set_A) starts. So we require the second voucher's l (l2) > first voucher's r.\n\n        Similarly, for condition b: we require the second voucher's r < first voucher's l.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to take two distinct vouchers from the same set. So we have two conditions to check for the same set.\n\n   However, we are going to consider two groups: set_A (duration d) and set_B (duration d2). When d == d2, then set_A = set_B. Otherwise, they are different.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We'll create two helper functions or data structures for each set:\n\n        Condition 1: For a given set S, we want to quickly answer: for a given end time E, what is the minimal cost of a voucher in S that has start time > E?\n        Condition 2: For a given set S, we want to quickly answer: for a given end time E, what is the minimal cost of a voucher in S that has start time < ...? Actually, condition 2 is: we have a voucher from set_B (with end time r) and we require a voucher from set_A with start time > r? No.\n\n   Actually, let's clarify:\n\n   For condition a (when set_A is the first and set_B the second): \n        We require: for a voucher i in set_A (with end time r_i), we need a voucher j in set_B with start time l_j > r_i.\n\n   For condition b (when set_B is the first and set_A the second):\n        We require: for a voucher j in set_B (with end time r_j), we need a voucher i in set_A with start time l_i > r_j.\n\n   But note: condition a and condition b are symmetric. However, we can precompute for set_A and set_B separately.\n\n   So for each set S (which is either set_A or set_B, and we are going to use the same set for both conditions if needed) we can:\n\n        Sort the set S by l (start) and by r (end). Then we can build a segment tree or use binary search and a Fenwick tree? But note: we only need to query by a threshold on one coordinate (like for condition a: we need to query in set_B for l > E). \n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n        For set_S (list of (l, r, cost)), we can sort by l (start) and then create an array of costs for the vouchers that start at a particular l, and then for queries by l>E, we can use a suffix minimum array (min_cost from index i to end) for the sorted-by-l array.\n\n   Similarly, for condition b, we can sort set_S by r (end) and then create a prefix minimum array for the sorted-by-r array? Actually, condition b requires: for a given r_j (from the other set), we need a voucher in set_S with l_i > r_j. But wait, no: condition b is defined as the other set's voucher ends before the current voucher's start. Actually, condition b is: the voucher from set_B (which is the first) has end time r_j, and we require a voucher from set_A (second) with start time l_i > r_j.\n\n   However, condition a and condition b are independent.\n\n   Actually, condition a: \n        We have voucher i (from set_A) and voucher j (from set_B): we require r_i < l_j.\n\n        We can preprocess set_B: sort set_B by l (start) and then for each possible l, we want the minimal cost of a voucher in set_B that starts at least at some value.\n\n   Similarly, condition b:\n        We have voucher j (from set_B) and voucher i (from set_A): we require r_j < l_i.\n\n        We can preprocess set_A: sort set_A by l (start) and then for each l, minimal cost for a voucher in set_A that starts at least at that l.\n\n   But note: condition a and condition b are two separate conditions. We can handle:\n\n   For condition a (set_A first, set_B second):\n        We'll sort set_B by l and create an array `min_cost_from_start` for set_B: \n            sorted_B = sorted(set_B, key=lambda x: x[0])   # by l\n            Then, we can create an array `min_cost_arr` such that min_cost_arr[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n        Then, for each voucher i in set_A (with end time r_i), we look for the first voucher in set_B with l >= (r_i+1). Then the minimal cost in set_B for those vouchers is min_cost_arr[index].\n\n   Similarly, for condition b (set_B first, set_A second):\n        We'll sort set_A by l and create an array `min_cost_from_start` for set_A.\n\n   However, note: condition a requires the set_B voucher to start after set_A's end. Condition b requires the set_A voucher to start after set_B's end.\n\n   But wait, condition b: the set_B voucher ends at r_j, and we require the set_A voucher to start after r_j. So we can use the same structure for set_A: \n        We sort set_A by l, and then for a given r_j, we want to find the smallest l in set_A that is greater than r_j.\n\n   Steps for a fixed pair (d, d2=x-d):\n\n   1. If d == d2, then set_A and set_B are the same set. Then we have two conditions (a and b) to check, but note: we are allowed to use two distinct vouchers from the same set.\n\n        Condition a: for each voucher i in set_A, we look for a voucher j in set_A (j != i) such that l_j > r_i.\n        Condition b: for each voucher i in set_A, we look for a voucher j in set_A (j != i) such that l_j < ??? Actually, condition b is: the other voucher (j) must end before i starts? \n            Condition b: the second voucher j (from set_A) must end before the first voucher i starts: r_j < l_i.\n\n        But note: condition a and condition b are two different ways the two vouchers can be arranged.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the same two vouchers might satisfy both conditions? Actually, no, because if one satisfies condition a, then the two vouchers don't overlap and we don't need condition b for the same pair. But we are allowed to use the two conditions independently: we want to consider both ways.\n\n        But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive for a fixed pair? Actually, no. Consider two intervals [1,3] and [4,6]: \n            Condition a: [1,3] is first, [4,6] is second: 3 < 4 -> true.\n            Condition b: [4,6] is first, [1,3] is second: 6 < 1 -> false.\n\n        So for a fixed pair (i, j) only one condition can hold.\n\n   2. Therefore, for the same set, we can:\n\n        For condition a: \n            Sort set_A by r (the end) and then for each voucher i (with end r_i) we want to find a voucher j (distinct) in set_A with l_j > r_i and minimal cost.\n\n        But wait, we can use the same preprocessing for set_A for condition a and condition b? \n\n        Actually, for condition a (using set_A as first) we require set_A's voucher i has end r_i, and we need a voucher j in set_A (distinct) with start l_j > r_i.\n\n        For condition b (using set_A as second) we require set_A's voucher j has start l_j, and we need a voucher i (distinct) in set_A with end r_i < l_j.\n\n        But note: condition b is defined by: the first voucher (from set_A) has end r_i, and the second voucher (from set_A) has start l_j > r_i? Actually, condition b is: the first voucher (from set_A) is j? Or wait, condition b: the first voucher is from set_B? \n\n        Correction: In our breakdown, condition a and condition b are defined by the two sets. When the sets are the same, we have to consider two different orders:\n\n            Condition a: set_A (first) and set_A (second): requires the first ends before the second starts.\n            Condition b: set_A (first) and set_A (second): requires the second ends before the first starts.\n\n        But note: condition b is actually the same as condition a but with the roles reversed. \n\n        However, we can break condition b into: \n            We require the second voucher (from set_A) ends before the first voucher (from set_A) starts.\n\n        But wait, the condition for non-overlap is: \n            Either (voucher1 ends < voucher2 starts) OR (voucher2 ends < voucher1 starts)\n\n        So when using two vouchers from the same set, we can consider:\n\n            Case 1: [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are two vouchers. Then we require either:\n                r1 < l2   OR   r2 < l1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Condition a: use (l1, r1) as first and (l2, r2) as second -> requires r1 < l2.\n            Condition b: use (l2, r2) as first and (l1, r1) as second -> requires r2 < l1.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over the set, so we can consider each pair twice? Or we can do:\n\n            For condition a: sort set_A by r (so that we can quickly find a voucher with start > current end) and then for each voucher, we look for a voucher with start > current end.\n\n            For condition b: sort set_A by l (so that we can quickly find a voucher with end < current start) and then for each voucher, we look for a voucher with end < current start.\n\n        However, we can combine both conditions by:\n\n            We want to consider all pairs (i, j) from set_A (i != j) such that either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n\n        But we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use two separate structures for set_A (when d == d2):\n\n        Structure for condition a (first voucher ends before second starts):\n            Sort set_A by r (the end) and then create an array for the starts and costs for the sorted set. Then, we can also sort by start for condition b.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Condition a: \n                Sort set_A by r (increasing). Then, we want for each voucher i (with end r_i) to find a voucher j (with j>i in the sorted-by-r order? Not necessarily) such that l_j > r_i and minimal cost.\n\n            We can do: \n                Create an array of (l, cost) for set_A, then sort by r, and then for the starts, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? Or we can do:\n\n                Sort set_A by r, and then also keep the starts. Then, we can extract the starts and then build a segment tree for the minimal cost for starts above a certain value.\n\n            Alternatively, we can sort set_A by r, and then for the starts, we can compress the start values and then do a sweep.\n\n        But note: the constraints are up to 200000, and we are only doing this for the set_A that has duration d (and d2=d) and similarly for the other set.\n\n   However, we are already grouping by duration, and the total number of vouchers is n (up to 200000). The worst-case is if one duration has many vouchers.\n\n   Considering the complexity, we can do:\n\n        For each duration d (and d2 = x-d) we do:\n\n            Let set1 = all vouchers with duration d\n            Let set2 = all vouchers with duration d2\n\n            Then, we want to compute:\n\n                ans1 = minimal cost for (i in set1, j in set2) such that r_i < l_j   (condition a)\n                ans2 = minimal cost for (i in set1, j in set2) such that r_j < l_i   (condition b)\n\n            Then candidate = min(ans1, ans2) if both exist, else the one that exists.\n\n            Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate)\n\n        But note: we must consider the case when d == d2, then set1 = set2.\n\n        However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But the problem states two distinct vouchers.\n\n   How to compute ans1 for set1 and set2?\n\n        Condition a: r_i < l_j.\n\n        We can:\n\n            Sort set1 by r (increasing) and set2 by l (increasing).\n\n            Then, for each voucher i in set1, we want to find the minimal cost in set2 for which l_j > r_i.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Precompute an array for set2: \n                    sorted_set2 = sorted(set2, key=lambda x: x[0])   # by l\n                    Then, we can create an array `min_cost_from_l` for set2: \n                        Let T = sorted_set2, and let min_cost_arr[k] = minimum cost in set2 from index k to the end (suffix minimum).\n\n                Then, we need to find the smallest index k in T such that T[k][0] > r_i. Then the candidate cost for this voucher i is min_cost_arr[k] (if exists).\n\n            Then, we take the minimum candidate cost over all i in set1.\n\n        Similarly, for condition b: r_j < l_i.\n\n            Sort set1 by l (increasing) and set2 by r (increasing).\n\n            Then, for each voucher i in set1, we want to find the minimal cost in set2 for which r_j < l_i.\n\n            We can:\n\n                sorted_set2 = sorted(set2, key=lambda x: x[1])   # by r\n                Then, create a prefix minimum array for set2: min_cost_prefix[k] = minimum cost from 0 to k.\n\n                Then, for each voucher i in set1 (we need to consider the start l_i), we find the largest index k in set2 such that set2[k][1] < l_i, then candidate cost is min_cost_prefix[k] (if exists).\n\n        However, note: condition a and condition b are independent.\n\n   Implementation details:\n\n        We have to consider that set1 and set2 might be empty.\n\n        Steps for condition a (set1, set2):\n\n            Step 1: If set2 is empty, skip condition a.\n\n            Step 2: Sort set2 by l (start) and create an array of the starts and a suffix minimum array for the costs.\n\n            Step 3: Sort set1 by r (end) and then for each voucher (l1, r1, cost1) in set1, we do:\n\n                    Let target = r1 + 1   (we need l_j >= target)\n\n                    Use binary search in set2's starts (which is sorted) to find the first index where the start is >= target.\n\n                    Then, if that index is within the bounds, candidate = min_cost_arr[index]\n\n                    Then, update ans1 = min(ans1, cost1 + candidate)   (if candidate exists)\n\n            But note: we are only storing the minimal cost for set2 from that index to the end. So we are getting the minimal cost in set2 for a voucher that starts at or above target.\n\n        Similarly, for condition b:\n\n            Step 1: If set2 is empty, skip condition b.\n\n            Step 2: Sort set2 by r (end) and create a prefix minimum array for the costs.\n\n            Step 3: Sort set1 by l (start) and then for each voucher (l1, r1, cost1) in set1, we do:\n\n                    Let target = r1   (we need r_j < l1)\n\n                    Actually, condition b: we require r_j < l1. So we are looking for set2's vouchers with r_j < l1.\n\n                    Then, we want the minimal cost in set2 for vouchers with r_j < l1.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Use binary search to find the last index in set2 (sorted by r) such that r_j < l1.\n\n                        Then, if found, candidate = min_cost_prefix[index] (the minimal cost from 0 to index)\n\n                    Then, update ans2 = min(ans2, cost1 + candidate)\n\n        Then, candidate_total = min(ans1, ans2) if both are computed, else the one that is computed.\n\n        Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate_total)\n\n   However, note: condition a and condition b are two different conditions and they use different sets (set1 and set2) but when d==d2, set1=set2. \n\n   But wait, in condition a we are using set1 as the first and set2 as the second. In condition b we are also using set1 as the first and set2 as the second? \n\n   Actually, condition a: set1 is the first, set2 is the second -> requires set1's end < set2's start.\n   Condition b: set1 is the first, set2 is the second -> requires set2's end < set1's start.\n\n   But wait, condition b is defined as the second voucher (which is set2) ends before the first voucher (set1) starts? \n\n   Let me correct:\n\n        Condition a: \n            First voucher: set1 (duration d) -> [l_i, r_i]\n            Second voucher: set2 (duration d2) -> [l_j, r_j]\n            Condition: r_i < l_j.\n\n        Condition b:\n            First voucher: set2 (duration d2) -> [l_j, r_j]\n            Second voucher: set1 (duration d) -> [l_i, r_i]\n            Condition: r_j < l_i.\n\n        But wait, in condition b, the two vouchers are taken in reverse order. Actually, the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. However, in our breakdown, we are fixing the order of the sets. \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify which voucher is first. The condition is: they don't intersect if either the first ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts.\n\n        However, we broke it down as:\n\n            Condition a: set1 first, set2 second -> requires set1's end < set2's start.\n            Condition b: set2 first, set1 second -> requires set2's end < set1's start.\n\n        But these two conditions are independent and cover the two possibilities.\n\n        However, in our code, we are considering:\n\n            Condition a: set1 first, set2 second -> condition: set1.r < set2.l.\n            Condition b: set2 first, set1 second -> condition: set2.r < set1.l.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   But note: when d == d2, then set1 = set2, and we are essentially considering two different orders of the same set. However, the problem requires two distinct vouchers. \n\n        In condition a, we are using two distinct vouchers from set1 (because set1=set2). Similarly, condition b uses two distinct vouchers from set1.\n\n        But note: in condition a, we are querying set2 (which is set1) for a voucher with l_j > r_i. We must ensure that we are not matching the same voucher i with itself? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not say the two vouchers must be distinct in the sense of indices, but they must be two different vouchers. However, if we use the same voucher twice, that would be invalid. \n\n        How do we avoid that?\n\n        Our method for condition a: \n            We are iterating over set1 (which is set2) and then querying set2 (same set) for a voucher j that has l_j > r_i. \n\n            But if there is a voucher j that is the same as the current voucher i, then we would have j=i and then l_j = l_i, and we require l_i > r_i? That is impossible because for a valid voucher, l_i <= r_i. So we are safe from matching the same voucher? \n\n            However, what if the same voucher appears twice in the set? The input does not guarantee distinct vouchers. But the problem says: choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i≠j). \n\n        But note: the input may contain duplicate vouchers? The problem does not say they are distinct. However, we are grouping by duration. If two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) are present, then they are two distinct vouchers (different indices). \n\n        But if we have two identical vouchers, then condition a: for voucher i, we require a voucher j (with j≠i) such that l_j > r_i. Since the voucher i has l_i and r_i, and if we have another voucher j with the same (l, r), then we require l_j = l_i > r_i? Which is false because l_i <= r_i. So duplicates won't help.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: we are storing the entire list of vouchers for a duration. We are not removing duplicates. \n\n        The problem says: two vouchers i and j (i≠j). So even if two vouchers are identical, they are distinct. But the condition of non-overlap must hold: the two identical vouchers [1,3] and [1,3] do overlap. So they are not allowed. \n\n        But our condition a: for [1,3], we require a voucher j (from set2) with l_j > 3. So if there is a voucher [4,6] (same as the first one) then we use that.\n\n        Therefore, the method naturally avoids using the same voucher because the condition (l_j > r_i) is not satisfied for the same voucher (since l_i <= r_i).\n\n        However, if there are two different vouchers with the same (l, r, cost) and they are the same, then we are storing two entries. But then condition a: for the first one, we look for a voucher j (from set2) with l_j > r_i. The second one has the same l_i and r_i, so l_j = l_i <= r_i -> doesn't satisfy. So we are safe.\n\n   Complexity:\n\n        For each duration d (and d2 = x-d) we do:\n\n            Condition a: \n                Sorting set1 (by r) and set2 (by l) -> O(n1 log n1 + n2 log n2)\n                Then, for set1 (n1 elements) we do a binary search in set2 (n2 elements) -> O(n1 * log n2)\n\n            Condition b: \n                Sorting set2 (by r) and set1 (by l) -> O(n1 log n1 + n2 log n2)\n                Then, for set1 (n1 elements) we do a binary search in set2 (n2 elements) -> O(n1 * log n2)\n\n        Then, the overall complexity is the sum over all d (with d and d2=x-d) of (n1 log n2 + n1 log n2) = 2 * (n1 log n2). \n\n        But note: the same pair (d, d2) is considered only once. Also, if d > d2, then we don't consider d2 again because we are iterating d from 1 to max_duration, but we can iterate over the durations that appear.\n\n        However, we can iterate d from 1 to max_duration (or up to x//2? Actually, we must consider all d such that d and x-d are in the keys of the dictionary). \n\n        But note: the total number of distinct durations is at most n (200000) but the pairs (d, x-d) might be repeated. We can iterate over the keys of the dictionary.\n\n        But wait, if we iterate over all keys, then for each key d, we consider d2 = x-d. Then if d2 is in the dictionary, we process the pair (d, d2). But if d==d2, then we process the same set twice? \n\n        Actually, we can avoid double counting by:\n\n            Only consider d <= x-d? \n\n        However, note: if d < d2, then we process the pair (d, d2) and then when we get to d2, we will process (d2, d) and that is the same pair. \n\n        So we should only consider pairs (d, d2) with d <= d2 and d2 = x-d, and then if d==d2, then we process once.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over all d, and then if d <= x-d, then process. But wait, what if d > x-d? Then we skip. But then we would miss the pair (x-d, d). \n\n        Actually, we should consider every unordered pair (d, d2) exactly once. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let D be the set of durations that appear.\n\n            For each d in D:\n                d2 = x - d\n                If d2 in D and d <= d2:\n                    process (d, d2)\n                But wait, if d > d2, then we skip, but then when d' = d2, we will have d' <= d? Not necessarily.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to x//2 (floor) and then consider d and x-d, and if d == x-d, then process once, and if d < x-d, then process the pair (d, x-d). \n\n        But note: x can be even or odd.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let D be the set of durations that appear.\n\n            For d in range(1, (x+1)//2 + 1): \n                d2 = x - d\n                if d2 in D and d <= d2:\n                    process (d, d2)\n\n            But wait, if d2 < d, then we skip? \n\n        Alternatively, we can simply iterate over the distinct durations that are <= x/2. But note: if d > x/2, then d2 = x-d < d, and we would have already processed the pair (d2, d) when d2 was the smaller one.\n\n        However, we must process the pair (d, d2) even if d>d2? \n\n        Actually, the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. So we can process the pair (d, d2) only once, and we can choose to process when d <= d2.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let by_duration = {}   # mapping from duration to list of (l, r, cost)\n\n            Then, let durations = set(by_duration.keys())\n\n            Then, for d in durations:\n                d2 = x - d\n                if d2 not in by_duration:\n                    continue\n                if d <= d2:\n                    # process the pair (d, d2)\n                else:\n                    # skip because we will process when d'=d2 (which is < d) later? \n                    # But wait, if d>d2, then d2 is less than d, so we would have processed the pair (d2, d) when d2 was considered.\n\n            However, we must avoid processing the same pair twice. \n\n            But note: the condition for the pair (d, d2) is the same as (d2, d). \n\n            But wait, condition a and condition b are defined by the order of the sets. \n\n            In condition a for (d, d2): \n                set1 = by_duration[d], set2 = by_duration[d",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently processing the vouchers by grouping them by their duration and then checking pairs of durations that sum up to `x`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers that have a specific duration.\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d` in the grouped list. If such a duration exists, we proceed to find valid pairs of vouchers from these two groups that do not overlap.\n3. **Non-overlapping Condition**: For each voucher in the first group, we look for vouchers in the second group that start after the end of the first voucher (ensuring no overlap). Similarly, we check the reverse condition where vouchers from the second group end before those from the first group start.\n4. **Efficient Search with Sorting and Binary Search**: To efficiently find non-overlapping vouchers, we sort the vouchers in each group by their start or end times and use binary search to quickly locate valid vouchers.

d`, the algorithm checks for non-overlapping pairs between the corresponding voucher lists.\n4. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Vouchers**: Using binary search on sorted lists of start or end times, the algorithm efficiently finds the cheapest vouchers that meet the non-overlapping conditions (either ending before starting or vice versa).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal cost of valid pairs is tracked and printed, or `-1` if no valid pairs exist.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively by leveraging sorting and binary search to minimize the number of operations needed.",
