He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. (But note: after appending, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b')\n 2. The process:\n    - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n    - B appends some number of 'b's (so the string so far has only 'a's and then 'b's).\n    - Then C appends some number of 'c's, and the number of 'c's is equal to either the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string at the time of C's appending.\n\n However, note that when C appends, the entire string already includes the original 'a's and the appended 'b's. So the counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed (from the first two steps). But wait: the problem says that C appends 'c' and the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string at that moment (which is the string without the 'c's? Actually, note: the string that C receives has only 'a' and 'b'. So the counts for 'a' and 'b' are from the part that C sees. Then C appends 'c's, so the entire string becomes [original a's and b's] + [c's].\n\n But note: the condition for the number of 'c' is based on the string that C receives (which is the string after B). So let:\n   n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (because the entire string is built from the initial a's and then the b's and then c's; the a's don't change)\n   n_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (same reason: the b's are appended by B and remain until C adds c's)\n\n However, wait: what if the string we have is not in the correct order? For example, if we have a 'c' in the middle, then it violates the process because C only appends at the end.\n\n Steps to check:\n\n Condition 1: The string must be non-decreasing in the sense that all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because:\n   - A provides a string of 'a's.\n   - B appends 'b's (so after the a's, we have b's).\n   - C appends 'c's (so after the b's, we have c's).\n\n Therefore, the string should be composed of:\n   - Zero or more 'a's (at least one because the problem states that A has at least one 'a' and then B appends at least one 'b'? Actually, note: \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", but that is after B. And C appends so that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. So the minimal string is \"ab\" (then C appends either 1 c because number of a is 1 and number of b is 1, so both conditions hold? Actually, the condition for C is that the number of c is equal to the number of a OR the number of b. In \"ab\", the counts are: a=1, b=1. Then if C appends 1 c, then the string becomes \"abc\", which satisfies: the number of c (1) equals the number of a (1) and also the number of b (1). \n\n But note: the example input includes:\n   ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n Let's break down the examples:\n\n Example 1: \"aaabccc\"\n   Count: \n      a: 3\n      b: 1\n      c: 4\n\n   Condition for C: the number of 'c' must be either the number of 'a' (3) or the number of 'b' (1). Here, 4 is neither 3 nor 1 -> so why is the answer YES?\n\n   Wait, I think I misunderstood the condition. The problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". But note: the string at the time C appends does not include the 'c's. So the entire string that C appends is the string with only 'a' and 'b'. Then, the condition is based on the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the string that C receives.\n\n   In the example \"aaabccc\":\n     The string that C receives is \"aaab\" (because C appends to the end). Then, the counts in the string that C receives are:\n        a: 3, b: 1.\n\n     Now, C appends 4 'c's? But 4 is not equal to 3 (number of a) nor 1 (number of b). So why is it valid?\n\n   Let me re-read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n   Note: the string here refers to the string that C receives (before appending). So the condition is: the number of 'c' appended (let that be x) must be either the total number of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the string C received, because the string C received is the original a's and the b's) OR the total number of 'b' in the string C received.\n\n   But in the example, the string C received is \"aaab\": \n        number of 'a' is 3, number of 'b' is 1.\n        Then C appends 4 'c's? That doesn't match.\n\n   However, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Alternatively, note the example: \"aaabccc\" has 3 a's, 1 b, and 4 c's. But wait, the entire string has 3 a's and 1 b, so the string that C received was \"aaab\", which has 3 a's and 1 b. Then C appends 4 c's. But 4 is not 3 and not 1.\n\n   There must be an error in my reasoning.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n   Here, the string is the entire string after B (i.e., the string that C receives). So the condition is on the string that C receives, which is the string of a's and b's.\n\n   But then the example \"aaabccc\" has 3 a's and 1 b. Then the number of c's appended is 4, which is not 3 and not 1. So it should be NO.\n\n   However, the example output is YES.\n\n   This indicates that my understanding of the string that C uses for counting might be incorrect.\n\n   Let me consider the possibility that the problem means: the number of 'c' appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the entire final string? But wait, the entire final string includes the c's. Then the condition would be:\n\n        Let n_c = number of c's.\n        Then n_c must equal either (number of a's) OR (number of b's) in the entire final string.\n\n   But note: the entire final string has:\n        n_a (from the beginning) remains the same.\n        n_b (from B) remains the same.\n        n_c (from C) is the new ones.\n\n   So the condition would be: n_c == n_a OR n_c == n_b.\n\n   In the example \"aaabccc\": \n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 4 -> 4 != 3 and 4 != 1 -> still NO.\n\n   But wait, the example says YES.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the condition is on the entire string that C receives (the one without c's) for the counts of 'a' and 'b'? Then the condition is: the number of c's appended must equal the number of 'a' in that string OR the number of 'b' in that string.\n\n   Then in \"aaabccc\": \n        The string that C receives is \"aaab\", so the counts are: a=3, b=1.\n        Then C appends 4 c's, but 4 != 3 and 4 != 1 -> NO.\n\n   Another possibility: the problem allows that the number of c's can be chosen to be either the current total number of 'a' OR the current total number of 'b' (in the entire string that C receives). But note, the entire string that C receives is fixed. So the number of c's appended is fixed to one of these two numbers.\n\n   However, the problem says \"some number\", meaning that C chooses a number that is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' in the string he receives.\n\n   Then the example \"aaabccc\" has 4 c's, but 4 is neither 3 nor 1 -> invalid.\n\n   But wait, the example input is \"aaabccc\", and the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   Let me check the example again: the example says \"Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'.\" \n\n   Wait, the example says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. In \"aaabccc\", the number of 'a' is 3, but the number of 'c' is 4. So that doesn't match.\n\n   There seems to be a contradiction.\n\n   Let me look at the example input: the example says the first example is \"aaabccc\".\n\n   What if the example intended that the string was built differently? Or maybe the example explanation is wrong.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem does not require that the entire string must have the property that the counts of 'a' and 'b' are the ones from the initial string. Because when C appends, the string that C receives is fixed, but the condition is about the counts in that fixed string.\n\n   But then how is \"aaabccc\" valid?\n\n   Let me try to reverse-engineer:\n\n   Possibility: the string \"aaabccc\" might have been built from:\n        A: \"aaa\" (three 'a's)\n        B: appends one 'b' -> \"aaab\"\n        Then C appends: the condition is that the number of 'c' must be either the number of 'a' (3) or the number of 'b' (1). He appends 3 'c's? Then the string becomes \"aaabccc\" but wait, that would be 3 'c's, not 4.\n\n   But the string is \"aaabccc\", which has 4 'c's.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the process is:\n\n        A: \"aaa\" (3 a's)\n        B: appends 1 b -> \"aaab\"\n        Then C appends: the condition is that the number of 'c' must be the total number of 'a' (3) OR the total number of 'b' (1). But note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the entire string that C receives (which is \"aaab\")? Then 3 or 1.\n\n        If C appends 3 'c's, then the string is \"aaabccc\" with 3 c's, not 4.\n\n   So there's a discrepancy.\n\n   After reading the example note again: \"Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'.\" \n\n   This implies that the example considers the entire final string. But then the entire final string has 3 a's and 4 c's, so the number of c's (4) is not equal to the number of a's (3). \n\n   Unless the example is referring to something else.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem may allow that the counts are taken from the entire final string. But then the condition is on the entire final string: the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire final string.\n\n   In the entire final string \"aaabccc\":\n        a: 3, b: 1, c: 4.\n\n   Then the condition is: 4 (c's) must equal 3 (a's) or 1 (b's) -> no.\n\n   But wait, the example says \"the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'\", meaning they are talking about the entire string? Then they must mean that the entire string has 3 a's and 4 c's, so that is not equal.\n\n   However, the example output is YES.\n\n   There's a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem statement carefully:\n\n   \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n   The key is: in the string. Does \"the string\" refer to the string at the time of appending (without the c's) or the entire string including the c's?\n\n   The problem says: \"he appends ... the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\"\n\n   The word \"in the string\" — which string? The entire string that results from the appending, or the string before appending?\n\n   The natural interpretation is: the string that C is given (without the c's) because the condition is set by A and B.\n\n   But then the example \"aaabccc\" is invalid.\n\n   Let me check the provided examples:\n\n   Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> NO\n   Example 3: \"aabc\" -> YES\n\n   For \"aabc\":\n        Count: \n          a: 2, b: 1, c: 1.\n\n        The string must be built as:\n          A: \"aa\" (but wait, the string is \"aabc\", so the initial a's are 2, then B appends one 'b', then C appends one 'c'.\n\n        Condition for C: the number of 'c' (1) must equal the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (1) -> yes, because 1==1.\n\n        Also, the order is: two a's, then one b, then one c -> valid.\n\n        So \"aabc\" is valid.\n\n   Now, what about \"aaabccc\"?\n\n   Let me assume the problem intended that the condition is on the entire final string (meaning the entire string has the property that the count of c's equals the count of a's OR the count of b's). Then:\n\n        \"aaabccc\": \n            a: 3, b: 1, c: 4 -> 4 != 3 and 4 != 1 -> NO.\n\n        But the example output is YES.\n\n   Alternatively, what if the condition is on the entire final string for the counts of a and b, but the number of c's can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it is equal to the count of a's OR the count of b's in the entire final string? But wait, the entire final string includes the c's, so the count of a's and b's remains the same as the string that C received. So the condition would be:\n\n        Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as in the string C received)\n        Let n_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (same)\n        Then the number of 'c' (n_c) must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n        For \"aaabccc\": n_c = 4, n_a = 3, n_b = 1 -> 4 is not 3 and not 1 -> NO.\n\n   Another possibility: the condition is that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire string that C receives, but the entire string that C receives is the one without the c's. Then the condition is as above.\n\n   But wait, the example says: \"Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'.\" \n\n   What if the example meant that the entire string has the property that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (if we consider the entire string)? Then the example would be invalid.\n\n   I think there is a mistake in the example explanation. The problem statement says:\n\n        Input: \n            ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        Output:\n            ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n   So the first example is supposed to be YES.\n\n   Let me try to figure out what the intended meaning is.\n\n   Alternative interpretation: the string is built by:\n        Step 1: A gives a string of k 'a's.\n        Step 2: B appends m 'b's.\n        Step 3: C appends n 'c's, where n is either k or m.\n\n   But note: the entire string then has:\n        a: k\n        b: m\n        c: n (which is either k or m)\n\n   Then the total length is k + m + n.\n\n   And the condition for the string is that the counts of a, b, c must satisfy: n is either k or m.\n\n   Now, in the example \"aaabccc\": \n        k = 3, m = 1, then n must be either 3 or 1. But the string has 4 c's, so n=4, which is not 3 or 1.\n\n   But wait, the entire string is \"aaabccc\", so the a's are 3, the b's are 1, and the c's are 4. \n\n   However, note that the string must be built in the order: all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n   So the condition on the order is: the string must be non-decreasing in the sense of 'a' < 'b' < 'c'.\n\n   Now, if we consider the example \"aaabccc\", the order is correct: 'a's then 'b' then 'c'. But the count of c's is 4, which is not 3 or 1.\n\n   However, what if the counts of a and b in the string that C receives are not necessarily the same as the entire string? No, because the entire string's a's and b's are exactly those that were present before C appended.\n\n   Another possibility: the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire final string (which includes the c's). But wait, the entire final string has the same a's and b's as the string C received, because C only appends c's.\n\n   Therefore, the counts of a and b do not change. So the condition is solely on the counts of a and b from the string C received.\n\n   But then \"aaabccc\" is invalid.\n\n   I suspect the example explanation is flawed.\n\n   Let me check the sample input \"aabc\" (third example) with the condition that the entire string must have the property that the count of c's is either the count of a's or the count of b's in the entire string (including the c's)? \n\n   In \"aabc\": \n        a: 2, b: 1, c: 1.\n        Condition: the number of c's (1) must be either the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (1). \n        Since 1 == 1, it holds.\n\n   Now, if we apply the same condition to \"aaabccc\": \n        c's = 4, a's = 3, b's = 1 -> 4 is not 3 and not 1 -> NO.\n\n   But wait, the problem says that C appends a number of c's that is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string (the string that C receives). In the string that C receives for \"aaabccc\", the counts are a=3, b=1. So C must append either 3 or 1 c's. \n\n   However, the string we have is \"aaabccc\", which has 4 c's. How did we get 4? \n\n   There are two possibilities:\n\n   1. The example intended that the string was built with different counts: maybe the initial a's were 4, then b's were 0? But the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   2. Or, the example intended that the condition is on the entire final string, meaning the number of c's is either the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire final string. \n\n   But then for \"aaabccc\": \n        entire string: a=3, b=1, c=4 -> 4 is not 3 and not 1 -> NO.\n\n   But wait, what if the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire string? Then for \"aaabccc\", it fails.\n\n   However, the example output is YES.\n\n   Another idea: the problem says that C appends some number of c's such that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string (meaning the string that C receives). Then, the entire string is built by:\n\n        S = (a's) + (b's) + (c's)\n\n   and the condition is: len(c's) = (# of a's) OR len(c's) = (# of b's)\n\n   In \"aaabccc\": \n        # of a's = 3, # of b's = 1, so the c's must be either 3 or 1. But the string has 4 c's.\n\n   This doesn't match.\n\n   Let me consider the possibility that the string might have been built by:\n\n        A: a string of a's (say k a's)\n        B: appends a string of b's (say m b's)\n        C: appends a string of c's of length either k or m.\n\n   But note: the entire string then has:\n        a: k\n        b: m\n        c: either k or m.\n\n   Then the total length is k + m + (k or m).\n\n   Now, the string \"aaabccc\" has length 7: 3 a's, 1 b, 4 c's.\n\n   We require that the number of c's is either 3 or 1. But 4 is neither.\n\n   Unless the condition is not exclusive to the string that C receives, but to the entire string? Then the condition would be: the number of c's must be either the number of a's (which is 3) or the number of b's (which is 1). Then 4 is not 3 and not 1 -> NO.\n\n   I'm stuck.\n\n   Let me look at the sample outputs and inputs again.\n\n   Example 3: \"aabc\" -> YES.\n\n   In \"aabc\": \n        a: 2, b: 1, c: 1 -> condition: 1 (c) is either 2 (a) or 1 (b) -> true.\n\n   Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> NO.\n\n   \"bbacc\": \n        b: 2, a: 2, c: 2 -> but the order is not correct: the string starts with 'b', so it cannot be built by the process (which requires a's first).\n\n   Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES.\n\n   What if the condition is applied differently? \n\n   Another interpretation: the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire string (after C appends). But note: the entire string has the same a's and b's as before, so the condition is still the same.\n\n   But wait, the entire string has the same a's and b's as before, so the condition is independent of the c's.\n\n   However, note that the entire string includes the c's, but the counts of a and b are unchanged.\n\n   There is a possibility that the problem allows multiple ways to split the string into the three parts. \n\n   But the process is fixed: all a's come first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n   So the string must be non-decreasing in the ordering of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n   Steps to solve:\n\n   1. Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (each character is <= the next). But note, the string is built by appending, so the only allowed characters are a, then b, then c. So we can check:\n        - Once we see a 'b', we cannot see an 'a' again.\n        - Once we see a 'c', we cannot see an 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n   2. Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n   3. The condition for the number of 'c': must be either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b'.\n\n   But wait, what if the string has no 'b'? Then it's invalid because the problem requires that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Similarly, if there's no 'a', then also invalid.\n\n   However, the problem states: \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B). And then C appends. So the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (before C appends) and then C appends some 'c's.\n\n   But note: the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   So algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Check the order.\n        Let's traverse the string and make sure that once we leave the 'a' part, we never see an 'a' again, and once we leave the 'b' part, we never see a 'b' or 'a' again.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n            The string should be divided into three segments: [a's] (possibly empty? but note: at least one 'a' exists) then [b's] (at least one 'b') then [c's] (possibly empty? but the condition for C's appending requires that the number of c's is either the number of a's or b's, so if we have zero c's, then we require 0 == number of a's or 0 == number of b's. But the problem says C appends some number of c's (which could be zero? but the problem says \"appends some number\", and \"some number\" typically means at least one? However, the problem also says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of the 'a' and to the number of the 'b' at the same time.\" and both are positive. But note: the condition does not explicitly say that C appends at least one 'c'. However, the problem states that C appends some number of letters 'c'. In competitive programming, \"some number\" often means non-negative integer, but sometimes it means positive. However, the problem also says that they like the characters, so it's likely that C appends at least one. But note: the condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", and the number of 'a' or 'b' is at least 1 (because the string after B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'). So if C appends zero c's, then we require 0 == number of 'a' (which is >=1) -> false, and 0 == number of 'b' (>=1) -> false. So zero is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: if the condition is satisfied by the number of c's being either the number of a's or b's, and if we allow zero, then we require that either the number of a's is zero or the number of b's is zero, but that's not allowed because the string after B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So C must append at least one 'c'. However, the problem doesn't explicitly forbid zero, but the condition would fail because the counts of a and b are positive. So the string must have at least one 'c' only if the condition is met by a positive number.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive, then the number of 'c' must be positive (either the positive number of 'a' or the positive number of 'b').\n\n        Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c' only if the condition is satisfied by a positive number. But if the condition is satisfied by a positive number, then yes. However, note: the condition might be satisfied by both, but we only need one.\n\n        But wait, the problem says that C appends a number of 'c' that is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. So the number of 'c' must be at least 1.\n\n   Step 2: Count the frequency of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n   Step 3: Check that the string is in the form: all a's (at least one), then all b's (at least one), then all c's (at least one) [since the number of c's is at least 1].\n\n   However, wait: what if the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's, but the string might have extra c's? No, because C appends exactly that many c's.\n\n   But note: the entire string is given. We know the counts. The condition is: count('c') == count('a') or count('c') == count('b')\n\n   But wait, the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed (they are the counts from the part that C received). And the c's are appended. So the condition is on the counts in the entire string? Or in the part that C received?\n\n   Let me clarify with the example \"aabc\":\n\n        Entire string: \"aabc\"\n        Count('a') = 2, count('b') = 1, count('c') = 1.\n\n        Condition: count('c') == count('a') (1==2) -> false, or count('c') == count('b') (1==1) -> true.\n\n        So condition holds.\n\n   But note: the string that C received was \"aab\", so the counts were: a=2, b=1. Then C appended 1 'c'. So the condition is based on the counts in the string that C received? \n\n        Then the condition would be: the number of c's (1) must be either 2 or 1 -> true.\n\n   In the entire string, the counts of 'a' and 'b' are the same as in the string that C received, because C only added 'c's.\n\n   So the condition is: \n        Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as in the string C received)\n        Let n_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (same)\n        Let n_c = count of 'c' in the entire string.\n\n        Then the condition is: n_c == n_a OR n_c == n_b.\n\n   However, note: the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the string C received because the c's don't affect them.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' and compare n_c to them.\n\n   Then for \"aaabccc\":\n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 4 -> 4 != 3 and 4 != 1 -> NO.\n\n   But the example output is YES.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example \"aaabccc\". What if the string \"aaabccc\" is built differently?\n\n   Possibility: the initial string from A might be \"aaa\", then B appends \"b\", then C appends \"cccc\" (4 times) because the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's (3) OR the number of b's (1). But 4 is not 3 or 1.\n\n   Unless the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the entire final string? \n\n   In the entire final string, the counts are:\n        a: 3\n        b: 1\n        c: 4\n\n   Then the condition would be: 4 == 3 or 4 == 1 -> false.\n\n   Another possibility: the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string that C receives, but the string that C receives is not the entire string without the c's, but the entire string including the possibility of having appended fewer c's? \n\n   But the problem states: C appends some number of c's, and the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or b's in the string (the string at the time of appending).\n\n   Now, if the string that C receives is \"aaab\", then the condition is that the number of c's appended is 3 or 1.\n\n   But the example says the string is \"aaabccc\", meaning C appended 4 c's. \n\n   There is a disconnect.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The string here is the one that B gave to C. So the string that C receives is \"aaab\".\n\n   And the condition is: the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string (which is \"aaab\").\n\n   So the condition is: appended_c_count == 3 or appended_c_count == 1.\n\n   But the resulting string has 4 c's, which means appended_c_count is 4, not 3 or 1.\n\n   Therefore, the example \"aaabccc\" should be NO.\n\n   But the example output is YES.\n\n   I suspect there is an error in the example provided in the problem.\n\n   However, the sample input includes three examples and their expected outputs.\n\n   Let me try to find a string that fits the example \"aaabccc\" and the condition.\n\n   Suppose the string is not \"aaabccc\" but \"aaacccbc\"? But the order must be a's then b's then c's.\n\n   Or maybe the string is \"aaaabccc\"? Then a=4, b=1, c=4 -> condition: 4==4 (a) -> true, and also 4==1 (b) -> false. But the order is correct.\n\n   But the example is \"aaabccc\", not \"aaaabccc\".\n\n   Another possibility: the example \"aaabccc\" is a typo and they meant \"aaaabccc\" (with four a's). Then:\n\n        a:4, b:1, c:4 -> condition: 4==4 (true) -> YES.\n\n   Or \"aaabccc\" is a typo and they meant \"aaabbc\" (two b's) and then the condition: \n        a:3, b:2, c:1 -> condition: 1==3 or 1==2 -> false.\n\n   Or \"aaabccc\" is a typo and they meant \"aaabbbc\" (with two b's) and then the condition: \n        a:3, b:2, c:1 -> condition: 1==3 or 1==2 -> false.\n\n   Or \"aaabccc\" is a typo and they meant \"aaabbbc\" (two b's) and then the condition is satisfied by the number of c's being 1, but the number of b's is 2 -> no.\n\n   Or \"aaabccc\" is a typo and they meant \"aaabccb\" -> but then the order is broken.\n\n   Given the confusion, let me try to deduce from the sample outputs.\n\n   Sample inputs and outputs:\n\n        \"aaabccc\" -> YES\n        \"bbacc\" -> NO\n        \"aabc\" -> YES\n\n   We know \"aabc\" is valid.\n\n   What is common between \"aaabccc\" and \"aabc\"?\n\n   Both have the property that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'b's.\n\n   In \"aabc\": count('c') = 1, count('b') = 1 -> valid.\n\n   In",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends some 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C appends. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, meaning all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b' as per the problem statement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    a_count = s.count('a')\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    c_count = s.count('c')\n    \n    if a_count == 0 or b_count == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if not (all(char == 'a' for char in s[:a_count]) and \n            all(char == 'b' for char in s[a_count:a_count + b_count]) and \n            all(char == 'c' for char in s[a_count + b_count:])):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Order Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, and ends with zero or more 'c's. This ensures the string adheres to the construction process.\n2. **Character Counts**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters are computed to verify the condition that the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n3. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases where the string might be empty or lack at least one 'a' or 'b', which would immediately disqualify it from being valid.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"YES\" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's validity by ensuring both the structural order and the count conditions are met, providing a clear and concise solution.",
