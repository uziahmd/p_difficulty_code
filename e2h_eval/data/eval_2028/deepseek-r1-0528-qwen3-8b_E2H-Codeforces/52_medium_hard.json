Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the old candles to make more new ones. So:\n\n   Step 1: Use all the new candles (a) to burn for 'a' hours. Then we get 'a' old candles.\n   Then, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the old ones, and we will have a % b old candles left.\n\n   But then we also have the new candles we just made, which when burned will become old candles.\n\n   Actually, we can combine the process:\n\n   Let's denote:\n     total = a   (total candles we have, which are initially new)\n     hours = 0\n\n   However, we can model the burning process in cycles:\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But a better way is:\n\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We can use them and then recycle.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Burn all the new candles: so we get 'a' hours and 'a' old candles.\n     2. Then, from the old candles, we can make new ones: \n        new_candles = old_candles // b\n        leftover_old = old_candles % b\n\n     3. Then we add the new_candles to our available candles (which are now going to be burned again).\n\n   However, note: the process doesn't stop until we don't have enough old candles (and new candles) to form even one new candle.\n\n   We can simulate:\n\n     total_hours = 0\n     current_new = a\n     current_old = 0\n\n   But wait, we can also consider:\n\n     We start by having 'a' new candles. We burn them and then we get 'a' old ones.\n\n     Then we can make n1 = a // b new candles, and we have r1 = a % b old candles left.\n\n     Now, we have n1 new candles (which we can burn) and we still have r1 old candles.\n\n     Then, we burn the n1 new candles -> add n1 hours, and then we get n1 more old candles, so total old candles now is r1 + n1.\n\n     Then we can make n2 = (r1 + n1) // b, and leftover = (r1 + n1) % b.\n\n     And so on until n_i becomes zero.\n\n   However, we can also calculate without a loop? Or with a loop until the condition fails.\n\n   Since a and b are at most 1000, we can simulate until we have less than b in the combined new and old? But note: we are converting old to new.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a mathematical formula:\n\n   total_hours = a\n   Then we have a // b new candles, and a % b leftover.\n\n   Then we have a total of (a // b) + (a % b) candles to use in the next round? Actually, no: because the leftover is old, and the new ones we just made are new but they will burn and become old.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n     total = a\n     while total >= b:\n         hours += total // b   # because we use the candles to burn: actually, wait, we are burning the candles and then recycling.\n\n   But note: the burning gives us hours and then we get the same number of old candles. Then we convert those old candles to new ones.\n\n   However, let me think about the example: \"4 2\"\n\n     First, we have 4 new candles -> burn for 4 hours, then we have 4 old candles.\n        We can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and leftover 0 old candles.\n        Then we burn the 2 new candles for 2 hours, then we have 2 old candles -> make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and leftover 0.\n        Then we burn the 1 new candle for 1 hour, then we have 1 old candle -> not enough to make a new one (since b>=2).\n\n        Total hours: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n   But note: the process does not necessarily require that we burn all the candles at once? Actually, we can burn one candle per hour, but we can only use the candles we have. However, the problem says we can light a new candle each hour. We can assume that we use all available candles (both new and recycled) as long as we have enough.\n\n   Alternatively, we can model:\n\n     Let total = a\n     Let hours = 0\n     While total >= 1:   # but we need to check if we can make at least one candle?\n        Actually, we can break when total < b? Not exactly: because if we have, say, 1 candle and b=2, we cannot make a new one, but we can still burn the 1 candle.\n\n   However, note: the initial condition is that we have 'a' new candles. Then we burn them, and then we get old candles. Then we can use the old candles to make more.\n\n   The key is: we can burn a candle and then it becomes old. Then we can use old candles to make new ones.\n\n   But note: we can use the new candles and the old candles together to make new ones? Actually, the problem says: from b went out candles (i.e., old) we make a new one.\n\n   So the process:\n\n     We have two types: new and old. But initially, we only have new. When we burn a candle (whether new or old? Actually, wait: the problem says \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" and then after burning it goes out. Then he can take b went out candles to make a new one.\n\n     So we can only use the old ones to make new. Therefore, we must burn the new ones first, and then use the old ones to make new ones.\n\n     However, note: once we make a new one from old, that new one is indistinguishable from the original new ones.\n\n     So the simulation:\n\n        hours = 0\n        current_new = a\n        current_old = 0\n\n        while current_new > 0 or current_old >= b:   # but wait, we can burn new ones and then convert old ones. However, we can also burn the new ones and then use the old ones to make more.\n\n        Actually, we can break the process:\n\n        We can burn all the new candles (current_new) and then we get current_new old candles, and then we reset current_new to 0 and current_old += current_new.\n\n        Then, from current_old, we can make new_candles = current_old // b, and set current_old = current_old % b, and then we set current_new = new_candles.\n\n        Then we can add the hours: we burned current_new (the initial new ones) and then we burn the new_candles we just made? Actually, we haven't burned the new ones we made yet.\n\n        Alternatively, we can count the hours as we burn the candles.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          hours += current_new   # because we burn all the new ones\n          current_old += current_new\n          current_new = 0\n\n          Then, we can make new_candles from current_old:\n            new_candles = current_old // b\n            current_old = current_old % b\n            current_new = new_candles\n\n          Then we continue until current_new is 0 and current_old < b.\n\n        But wait, in the example: \n          a=4, b=2\n\n          Step1: hours=4, current_old=4, current_new=0.\n          Then, new_candles = 4//2 = 2, current_old = 0, current_new=2.\n\n          Then, we burn the 2 new candles: hours=4+2=6, current_old=2, current_new=0.\n          Then, new_candles=2//2=1, current_old=0, current_new=1.\n\n          Then, burn the 1 new candle: hours=6+1=7, current_old=1, current_new=0.\n          Then, 1//2=0, so done.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: we are burning the new candles we made. But what if we don't burn them immediately? Actually, the process is: we use the candles (both new and old-derived) and then we get old ones. Then we use the old ones to make more.\n\n        But note: the problem allows making a new candle from b old ones and then lighting that new candle. So we have to account for burning the newly made candles.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          total_hours = 0\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n\n          while new_candles > 0:\n              # Burn all the new candles\n              total_hours += new_candles\n              # These new candles become old\n              old_candles += new_candles\n              new_candles = 0\n\n              # Now, convert old_candles to new_candles\n              if old_candles >= b:\n                  new_candles = old_candles // b\n                  old_candles = old_candles % b\n              else:\n                  # We break because after burning we don't have enough to make a new candle, and there are no more new candles to burn (unless we made some from previous old candles, but we just set new_candles to 0 and then we break the loop condition)\n                  # But note: we might have new_candles from conversion, so we don't break here, we just set new_candles to 0 and then the loop condition fails.\n                  new_candles = 0\n\n          But wait, the above while loop condition is \"new_candles > 0\", so when we set new_candles to 0, we break.\n\n          However, in the example, after the first iteration we set new_candles to 2 (from 4//2). Then we burn 2, then set new_candles to 1 (from 2//2), then burn 1, then set new_candles to 0.\n\n          But note: the above code does not account for the fact that after burning the new candles, we get old_candles, and then we convert old_candles to new_candles. Then we set new_candles to that value and then the next iteration we burn them.\n\n          However, there's a catch: after burning the new_candles, we set new_candles to 0 and then we update from the old_candles. Then the next iteration we use the new_candles we just calculated.\n\n          But wait, in the above code, after burning the new_candles (the initial ones) we set new_candles to 0 and then we update from old_candles. Then we check the condition for the while loop: if new_candles (now 0) then we break. But we just made 2 new candles from old_candles, so we should continue.\n\n          Correction: we should not set new_candles to 0 and then break the loop. Instead, we can do:\n\n          total_hours = 0\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n\n          while True:\n              # Burn all the new candles\n              if new_candles == 0 and old_candles < b:\n                  break\n\n              # But if we have new_candles, we burn them.\n              total_hours += new_candles\n              old_candles += new_candles\n              new_candles = 0\n\n              # Convert old_candles to new_candles\n              if old_candles >= b:\n                  new_candles = old_candles // b\n                  old_candles = old_candles % b\n              else:\n                  # After conversion, if we don't have enough to make a new candle, then we break?\n                  # But note: we might have new_candles from previous steps? Actually, we set new_candles to 0 above, so if we don't have enough old_candles, then we break.\n                  break\n\n          However, the above breaks too early because after burning the new_candles we get old_candles and then we convert, but if we don't convert enough, we break. But the example: \n\n          First iteration:\n            new_candles = 4 -> burn: total_hours=4, old_candles=4, new_candles=0.\n            Then, 4>=2 -> new_candles = 4//2=2, old_candles=0.\n            Then the loop continues because new_candles=2>0.\n\n          Second iteration:\n            burn 2: total_hours=6, old_candles=2, new_candles=0.\n            Then, 2>=2 -> new_candles=2//2=1, old_candles=0.\n\n          Third iteration:\n            burn 1: total_hours=7, old_candles=1, new_candles=0.\n            Then, 1<2 -> break.\n\n          So that works.\n\n          But wait, what if we have a=1, b=2? Then:\n            new_candles=1 -> burn: total_hours=1, old_candles=1, new_candles=0.\n            Then, 1<2 -> break. So output 1.\n\n          Another example: a=6, b=3 (second sample)\n\n          Step1: burn 6 -> total_hours=6, old_candles=6, new_candles=0.\n                 6//3=2, old_candles=0 -> new_candles=2.\n\n          Step2: burn 2 -> total_hours=8, old_candles=2, new_candles=0.\n                 2<3 -> break.\n\n          Output 8, which matches.\n\n          However, consider a=10, b=3:\n\n          Step1: burn 10 -> hours=10, old=10 -> new=10//3=3, old=1 (since 10%3=1)\n          Step2: burn 3 -> hours=13, old=3+1=4 -> new=4//3=1, old=1\n          Step3: burn 1 -> hours=14, old=1+1=2 -> cannot make new, so done.\n\n          But let me count manually:\n\n          Start with 10 new candles.\n          Burn 10 -> 10 hours, and 10 old candles.\n          From 10 old, we make 3 new (using 9 old, leaving 1 old) -> 3 new candles.\n          Burn 3 -> 3 hours (total 13), now we have 1 (old) + 3 (old from burning) = 4 old.\n          From 4 old, we make 1 new (using 3 old, leaving 1 old) -> 1 new candle.\n          Burn 1 -> 1 hour (total 14), now we have 1 (old) + 1 (old from burning) = 2 old -> not enough.\n\n          So 14 hours.\n\n          But wait, the above algorithm:\n\n            Step1: hours=10, old=10 -> new=3, old=1.\n            Step2: hours=13, old=3+1=4 -> new=1, old=4%3=1 (but wait, 4//3=1, so 4-3=1).\n            Step3: hours=14, old=1+1=2 -> break.\n\n          So yes, 14.\n\n          However, note: in step2, after burning the 3 new candles, we get 3 old candles, and we had 1 old from before, so total 4 old. Then we use 3 of them to make 1 new, leaving 1 old.\n\n          The algorithm is correct.\n\n          But wait, the above code structure:\n\n          total_hours = 0\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n\n          while True:\n              if new_candles == 0 and old_candles < b:\n                  break\n\n              total_hours += new_candles\n              old_candles += new_candles\n              new_candles = 0\n\n              if old_candles >= b:\n                  new_candles = old_candles // b\n                  old_candles = old_candles % b\n              else:\n                  # After conversion, if we don't have enough, then we break because the next iteration would have new_candles=0 and old_candles < b.\n                  break\n\n          However, note: the condition at the beginning of the loop checks for new_candles==0 and old_candles < b. But in the body, we are burning the new_candles (so if new_candles is positive, we burn them). Then we set new_candles to 0 and then try to convert old_candles.\n\n          But the condition at the beginning is: if both conditions (no new and not enough old) then break. However, if we have new_candles, we burn them and then we might have new_candles again from conversion.\n\n          Alternatively, we can simplify by not having the initial condition and just breaking when after conversion we don't have any new_candles and the old_candles are less than b.\n\n          But note: the burning step requires that we have at least one candle to burn. So we must break when we have no candles to burn.\n\n          Actually, the burning step: we burn all the new_candles. Then we set new_candles to 0 and then we convert old_candles. Then the next iteration we check: if new_candles is 0 and old_candles < b, then we break.\n\n          However, we can restructure the loop to:\n\n          total_hours = 0\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n\n          while new_candles > 0 or old_candles >= b:\n              # If we have new_candles, burn them; if we don't, then we can only burn if we have old_candles to convert? Actually, no: we can only burn new candles. But wait, the problem says: we light up a new candle. So we can only use the new ones? \n\n          Wait, the problem says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\". So initially, we have new candles. Then, the candles we make from old are also new. But the burning process: we can only use the new ones (because they are the ones that are lit). And after burning, they become old.\n\n          However, the problem does not explicitly say that we cannot light an old candle. It says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\". So the process is: we use the old candles to make new ones, and then we use those new ones.\n\n          So we can only burn the new ones. Therefore, we must have at least one new candle to burn.\n\n          Then, how do we burn the old ones? We don't. We use the old ones to make new ones, and then burn the new ones.\n\n          Therefore, the process:\n\n            We can burn as many new candles as we have (each burn gives an hour and one old candle).\n\n            Then, we can use the old candles (from the previous burnings) to make new ones.\n\n          So the condition to continue is: we must have at least one new candle to burn.\n\n          But note: we can have new candles from conversion. So the condition is: we have new candles (either initially or converted) and we can burn them.\n\n          However, the above algorithm does:\n\n            In each iteration:\n              Burn all the new candles (so if we have 5 new, we burn 5 and get 5 old, and then we set new_candles to 0 and then convert old to new).\n\n          But wait: what if we don't have new candles? Then we break.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: we start with a new candles. Then we make new ones from old. Then we burn the new ones (which are the ones we just made). So the burning always uses the new ones.\n\n          Therefore, we must have new ones to burn. The condition to continue burning is having at least one new candle.\n\n          So we can change the loop condition to:\n\n          while new_candles > 0:\n\n          Then:\n\n          total_hours = 0\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n\n          while new_candles > 0:\n              # Burn all the new candles\n              total_hours += new_candles\n              old_candles += new_candles\n              new_candles = 0   # we use them all\n\n              # Now, we can make new candles from old_candles\n              if old_candles >= b:\n                  # Make as many new candles as possible\n                  new_candles = old_candles // b\n                  old_candles = old_candles % b\n              else:\n                  # We break because we don't have enough old candles to make a new one, and we just used all the new ones and there are no new ones left (we set new_candles to 0) and we cannot make more.\n                  # But wait, we set new_candles to 0 and then the condition fails. However, we just broke the condition by setting new_candles to 0. But we might have old_candles < b, so we cannot make new ones, and we don't have any new ones to burn.\n                  # But the loop condition is new_candles>0, so we break.\n                  pass\n\n          This will work for the examples:\n\n          Example1: a=4, b=2\n\n          Iteration1: new_candles=4 -> burn: hours=4, old=4, then new_candles = 4//2=2, old=0.\n          Iteration2: new_candles=2 -> burn: hours=6, old=2, then new_candles=2//2=1, old=0.\n          Iteration3: new_candles=1 -> burn: hours=7, old=1, then new_candles=0 (because 1<2) -> then we break.\n\n          Example2: a=6, b=3\n\n          Iteration1: burn 6 -> hours=6, old=6 -> new_candles=6//3=2, old=0.\n          Iteration2: burn 2 -> hours=8, old=2 -> then 2<3 -> new_candles=0, then break.\n\n          Example3: a=10, b=3\n\n          Iteration1: burn 10 -> hours=10, old=10 -> new_candles=10//3=3, old=10%3=1.\n          Iteration2: burn 3 -> hours=13, old=3+1=4 -> new_candles=4//3=1, old=4%3=1.\n          Iteration3: burn 1 -> hours=14, old=1+1=2 -> new_candles=0, then break.\n\n          But wait, in the last iteration, we set new_candles to 0, so the loop ends.\n\n          However, note that we are burning the new_candles we just made (from old ones) and then we get more old ones, but we break because we don't have enough to make a new candle. But the burning is accounted for.\n\n          But note: the above algorithm does not account for the fact that we might have old candles left from previous iterations that we didn't use. But that's okay because we use all the old candles in the conversion step.\n\n          However, there is a nuance: in the conversion step, we use the old_candles to make new ones, and then we set new_candles to the number of new ones, and then we burn them. But note: the burning step adds to old_candles, so we are effectively recycling.\n\n          This algorithm is straightforward.\n\n          But note: the problem says we start with a new candles. We don't start with any old candles.\n\n          We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n          However, we can also avoid the inner details and use a more efficient method by using a while loop that continues as long as we have new candles.\n\n          Code:\n\n          a, b = map(int, input().split())\n          new_candles = a\n          old_candles = 0\n          hours = 0\n\n          while new_candles > 0:\n              # Burn all the new candles\n              hours += new_candles\n              old_candles += new_candles\n              new_candles = 0\n\n              # Convert old_candles to new_candles\n              if old_candles >= b:\n                  new_candles = old_candles // b\n                  old_candles = old_candles % b\n\n          print(hours)\n\n          Let me test with the examples.\n\n          Example: ['4 2'] -> 7\n          Example: ['6 3'] -> 8\n\n          But wait, the second example: a=6, b=3.\n\n          Iteration1: \n            hours = 6, old_candles=6, new_candles=0.\n            Then, since old_candles>=3 -> new_candles=6//3=2, old_candles=0.\n          Iteration2:\n            hours=6+2=8, old_candles=2, new_candles=0.\n            Then, 2<3 -> so we don't update new_candles (it remains 0) and then we break.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: the burning step happens even if we don't have any new candles? No, the condition is \"while new_candles>0\", so we only enter the loop if new_candles>0.\n\n          However, in the first iteration we have new_candles=6 (which is >0). Then we burn them and then we set new_candles to 2 (from conversion). Then we enter the loop again because 2>0.\n\n          But wait, in the code above, after burning we set new_candles to 0, and then we update from old_candles. Then the condition for the while loop is checked at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, there is a potential inefficiency: we are burning the candles and then immediately converting the old ones. But the problem is small (a, b up to 1000) so it's acceptable.\n\n          But wait: what if a=0? Then we break immediately.\n\n          The input constraint: a>=1.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          Let's run the code with the provided examples.\n\n          Example: a=4, b=2 -> output 7\n          Example: a=6, b=3 -> output 8\n\n          But wait, the example input was given as two separate lines? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input: The single line contains two integers, a and b.\n\n          But the example input is given as:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          That means we are reading one line of input, but the example has two test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          \"The single line contains two integers\"\n\n          So we read one line and split it.\n\n          But the example input format is shown as two lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n          Input\n          4 2\n          6 3\n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"The single line\", meaning one line per test case. However, the example output is two numbers: 7 and 8.\n\n          But the problem is competitive programming and the input is one line per test. Actually, the problem says:\n\n          \"The single line contains two integers\"\n\n          So we are reading one line.\n\n          But the example input is provided as two lines? Actually, the example input is shown as:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          This might be a list of two strings, but in reality, the problem expects one test case per run.\n\n          However, the problem statement says: \"The single line\", so we read one line.\n\n          But if we want to test multiple test cases, we can modify the code to read until EOF.\n\n          The problem does not specify multiple test cases. The input format is one line.\n\n          Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n          But the example input is given as two lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n          Input\n          4 2\n          6 3\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n          \"The single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\"\n\n          So we read one line.\n\n          However, the example input is shown as two lines. This might be an error in the example representation.\n\n          Actually, the example input is:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input is given as a list of two strings. But in competitive programming, we usually have one test case per run.\n\n          Let me check the problem statement: It says \"Help him find this number.\" for the given input.\n\n          So we are to read one line and output one integer.\n\n          But the example output is two integers: 7 and 8.\n\n          This suggests that the example input might be two separate test cases. But the problem says \"The single line\".\n\n          Clarification: the problem says \"The single line\", meaning one line of input. So if we are writing a program that reads from stdin, we read one line and then output one integer.\n\n          However, if the problem intended multiple test cases, they would have said so.\n\n          But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          This is likely a representation of two test cases. But the problem says \"The single line\", so we must assume one test case.\n\n          After checking the example: the problem says:\n\n          Input\n          4 2\n\n          Output\n          7\n\n          and\n\n          Input\n          6 3\n\n          Output\n          8\n\n          So they are two separate examples. Therefore, the problem might be designed for multiple test cases? Or maybe the example input is provided in two separate lines.\n\n          Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n          \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n          and then it shows:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          But the sample input format is:\n\n          Input Format\n          The single line contains two integers, a and b.\n\n          So we read one line.\n\n          How should we handle multiple test cases?\n\n          The problem constraints say a and b are in the range [1,1000] and [2,1000] respectively.\n\n          But the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n          Looking at the example: they show two different inputs. But the problem says \"The single line\", so we assume one test case.\n\n          However, the example output is two numbers. This is confusing.\n\n          I think the example input representation in the problem statement is flawed.\n\n          Let me look at the note: \n\n          Note\n          Consider the first sample. For the first four hours...\n\n          So they are talking about one sample.\n\n          The second sample is separate.\n\n          But the problem says \"The single line\", meaning one line per test case.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we assume one test case per run.\n\n          Therefore, we read one line and output one integer.\n\n          But the example input is given as two lines. How did they get two outputs? They must have run the program twice.\n\n          So we don't need to worry about multiple test cases.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Write a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output.\"\n\n          And the example input is two lines. But wait, the problem says \"The single line\", so the input is one line.\n\n          Now, the confusion: the example input is shown as a list of two strings. But in the actual competition, the input is one line.\n\n          Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n          Code:\n\n          Read one line, split to get a and b.\n\n          Then simulate until new_candles becomes 0.\n\n          Print the total hours.\n\n          Let me code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"The single line\", so we read one line.\n\n          But wait, the example input is provided as two lines? Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n          Input\n          4 2\n\n          and\n\n          Input\n          6 3\n\n          separately.\n\n          So we are to read one line and output the answer for that line.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data:\n             # no input, but the problem guarantees at least one test case? \n             # But the constraints say a>=1, so we assume there is input.\n          a = int(data[0])\n          b = int(data[1])\n\n          Then run the simulation.\n\n          However, the problem says \"The single line\", so we read one line.\n\n          But the example input is two lines. This is inconsistent.\n\n          Actually, looking at the problem statement again, the example input is shown as:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          This might be a formatting issue. The intended input is one line with two integers.\n\n          So we'll read one line.\n\n          But wait, the example output is two numbers: 7 and 8. \n\n          This implies that the problem expects two test cases. \n\n          Let me re-read the problem statement: it says \"The single line\", but the example input is two lines.\n\n          This is ambiguous.\n\n          Since the problem statement says \"The single line\", we assume one test case.\n\n          However, the example input is provided as two lines. \n\n          But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then shows:\n\n          Input\n          ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n          and\n\n          Output\n          ['7', '8']\n\n          This representation is unusual. Typically, we would see:\n\n          Input: \n          4 2\n\n          Output:\n          7\n\n          and\n\n          Input:\n          6 3\n\n          Output:\n          8\n\n          But the problem states: \"The single line\", so we read one line.\n\n          How to resolve?\n\n          Since the problem says \"The single line\", we assume one test case. But the example input is two lines. \n\n          This discrepancy might be due to the fact that the problem is intended for multiple test cases. \n\n          Actually, the problem statement says: \"The single line\", meaning one test case per input file. But sometimes problems have multiple test cases and they read until EOF.\n\n          However, the constraints say a and b are in the given ranges, and the input format is one line.\n\n          But the example input is two lines. \n\n          Another possibility: the problem expects the input to be two integers on one line, and the example input is two test cases for illustration.\n\n          Therefore, we assume one test case per run.\n\n          But the sample tests are provided as two separate examples.\n\n          We'll write the code for one test case.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"The single line\", so we read one line.\n\n          If the competition system provides two test cases, they would be in separate runs? Or two lines in one input?\n\n          Actually, the problem says \"The single line\", so one line per test case. But if there are multiple test cases, they might provide multiple lines.\n\n          The problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n          Since the problem statement says \"The single line\", we assume one test case.\n\n          But to be safe, we can read until EOF if necessary.\n\n          However, the constraints are small and the problem says one line, so we assume one test case.\n\n          Let me submit the code for one test case.\n\n          But the example input is given as two lines. \n\n          After re‐reading the problem statement, it says:\n\n          \"Input\n          The single line contains two integers, a and b\"\n\n          So we read one line.\n\n          We'll assume one test case.\n\n          Code:\n\n          a, b = map(int, input().split())\n          new = a\n          old = 0\n          hours = 0\n\n          while new > 0:\n              hours += new\n              old += new\n              new = 0\n\n              if old >= b:\n                  new = old // b\n                  old = old % b\n\n          print(hours)\n\n          This passes the examples.\n\n          But wait, what if we have a=1, b=2? Then we output 1.\n\n          What if we have a=1000, b=1000? Then:\n\n          First: burn 1000 -> hours=1000, old=1000 -> new=1000//1000=1, old=0.\n          Then: burn 1 -> hours=1001, old=1 -> cannot make new, so done.\n\n          Output 1001.\n\n          Is that correct?\n\n          Yes: we have 1000 new candles -> burn for 1000 hours, then we have 1000 old -> make 1 new candle (since b=1000). Then we burn that one for 1 hour, total 1001.\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          We'll submit this.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\", so when we have exactly b, we make one new candle and no leftovers.\n\n          Our code handles that.\n\n          Final code:\n\n          Read",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, given that he starts with `a` new candles and can create a new candle from `b` old candles (those that have gone out after burning). The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the old ones into new ones until it's no longer possible to create any more candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero old candles. Initialize a variable `hours` to keep track of the total burning time.\n2. **Burning Phase**: While there are new candles available:\n   - **Burn the Candles**: Add the number of new candles to `hours` (each candle burns for one hour).\n   - **Update Old Candles**: The burned candles become old candles, so increment the old candles count by the number of new candles burned.\n   - **Recycle Old Candles**: If there are enough old candles (`old_candles >= b`), convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of `old_candles` by `b`, and the remaining old candles are the modulus result.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are no more new candles to burn and insufficient old candles to create new ones. The total `hours` accumulated during the burning phase is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    new_candles = a\n    old_candles = 0\n    hours = 0\n\n    while new_candles > 0:\n        hours += new_candles\n        old_candles += new_candles\n        new_candles = 0\n        \n        if old_candles >= b:\n            new_candles = old_candles // b\n            old_candles = old_candles % b\n            \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variables `new_candles`, `old_candles`, and `hours` are initialized with `a`, `0`, and `0` respectively.\n- **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles (`new_candles > 0`).\n  - **Burning**: Each iteration adds the number of new candles to `hours` because each candle burns for one hour.\n  - **Recycling**: After burning, the old candles are updated. If there are at least `b` old candles, they are converted into new candles (using integer division) and the remainder is kept as leftover old candles.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when no new candles are left to burn and not enough old candles remain to create new ones. The total `hours` is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the burning time.",
