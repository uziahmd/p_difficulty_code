The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting from 1) is defined by a rectangle of size:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The border of an (a x b) rectangle has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is at least 1x1, then the border is: \n        top and bottom: each row has b cells, but wait: actually for a rectangle of a rows and b columns, the border is:\n        top: b, bottom: b, left and right: (a-2) for each? Actually, no: the entire border is 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that if the rectangle has only 1 cell (a=1, b=1) then the border is 1, but by the formula above: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> that doesn't work.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For an a x b rectangle, the border (if we consider it as the outer frame) is:\n   top row: b cells\n   bottom row: b cells\n   the two sides (excluding the corners because they are already counted): (a-2) * 2 cells.\n\n So total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, when a=1 or b=1, this formula fails. However, note the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate (which is w x h). Since w>=3 and h>=3, the first rectangle is at least 3x3, so the first ring is computed with a=w, b=h. Then we subtract 4 for the next ring, so the next ring's rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n However, note the condition on k: \n   k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n This means that we will never have a negative dimension. But we must also check if the current ring's rectangle is valid.\n\n Actually, the problem states: the i-th ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). And the ring is the border of that rectangle.\n\n But note: the border of a rectangle that is 1x1? That would be 1 cell. However, our k is bounded so that the inner rectangle for the last ring must have at least 1x1? Actually, the condition says k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n Let's check with the example: \"3 3 1\" -> min(3,3)=3, then (3+1)//4 = 4//4 = 1 -> so k=1 is allowed.\n\n For the first ring: \n   w0 = 3, h0 = 3 -> the border of a 3x3 rectangle: \n        Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> which matches the example.\n\n Now, what if we have a 5x5 and k=2?\n   First ring: 5x5 -> border = 2*5+2*5-4 = 20-4 = 16.\n   Second ring: the inner rectangle is (5-4)=1x1 -> border of 1x1: but our formula 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> not correct.\n\n Therefore, we must adjust: the border formula works only when the rectangle has at least 2 rows and 2 columns? Actually, for a rectangle with a>=2 and b>=2, the border is 2*a+2*b-4. But if a==1 or b==1, then we cannot use the same formula.\n\n Alternatively, note the problem definition: \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\", meaning the ring is one cell wide. The ring is the set of all cells that are on the border of the inner rectangle.\n\n How to compute the number of cells in the border of an a x b grid?\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_cells = a * b   [the entire inner rectangle]\n   inner_cells = (a-2)*(b-2)   [if a>=2 and b>=2, then the inner part without the border]\n   Then the border = total_cells - inner_cells\n\n But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate based on the number of rings specified. The rings are placed in a specific pattern where each subsequent ring is two cells away from the edge of the previous ring. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate. Each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells inward from the previous ring. The i-th ring is defined by a rectangle of size `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`, and the ring itself consists of the border cells of this rectangle.\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of cells in the border of a rectangle can be calculated by subtracting the area of the inner rectangle (excluding the border) from the total area of the rectangle. For a rectangle of dimensions `a x b`, the border cells are given by `(a * b) - ((a-2) * (b-2))` if both `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to 2. If either dimension is less than 2, the entire rectangle is considered the border.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If the dimensions are valid (both >= 2), calculate the border cells using the formula. If not, the entire remaining rectangle is the border. Sum the cells for all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    total_gilded = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        \n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            total_gilded += a * b\n        else:\n            total_gilded += a * b - (a - 2) * (b - 2)\n    \n    print(total_gilded)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_gilded` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the current rectangle (`a` and `b`) by reducing the original dimensions by `4*(i-1)` (since each ring moves 2 cells inward in both directions).\n   - Check if either dimension is less than 2. If so, the entire rectangle is the border, so add `a * b` to `total_gilded`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the border cells by subtracting the area of the inner rectangle from the total area of the current rectangle and add this value to `total_gilded`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the number of cells for each ring by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
