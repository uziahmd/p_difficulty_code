Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10 spaceships and 10 bases. We need to check if there is a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between the R spaceships and B bases such that the straight lines connecting each spaceship to its base do not intersect.\n\n Conditions:\n - Each base must be connected to exactly one spaceship and vice versa.\n - The straight lines (in 2D) must not intersect (except at the endpoints, which are distinct points).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. Since we have R bases and R spaceships (but wait, the input has R spaceships and B bases, but the condition for perfect matching requires that every base has one guardian and each spaceship has one base, so actually we require R = B? Actually, the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies that we are looking for a perfect matching in a bipartite graph between spaceships and bases, but note: the total number of spaceships is R and bases is B. However, the example input has the first line as \"3 3\", meaning R=B=3, and the second example has \"2 1\", meaning R=2, B=1.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we must assign all R spaceships to exactly one of the B bases. And also \"every base has exactly one guardian\", so we must assign exactly one spaceship to each base. Therefore, we require R = B. However, the input might have R != B?\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n   \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\"\n\n This implies that the assignment is a bijection, so R must equal B. But the input says: \"The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10)\".\n\n So if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching? Actually, the problem says \"perfect matching\", which in a bipartite graph with two parts of size R and B requires R=B.\n\n However, note: the example input format: \n   First line: R, B\n   Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\n But the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\". So if R != B, then we cannot have a bijection. Therefore, we must first check that R == B.\n\n However, let me check the example: \n   Example 1: Input \"3 3 ...\", so R=B=3 -> output \"Yes\"\n   Example 2: Input \"2 1 ...\" -> R=2, B=1 -> output \"No\"\n\n So if R != B, we can immediately output \"No\".\n\n But wait: the problem does not explicitly say that the matching must be a bijection, but the conditions are:\n   - Every base has exactly one guardian -> each base is matched to one spaceship.\n   - Each spaceship has exactly one assigned base -> each spaceship is matched to one base.\n\n Therefore, the matching must be a bijection and hence R must equal B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output \"No\".\n 3. Else, read R lines for spaceships and B lines for bases.\n\n Now, we have 2*R+B points? Actually, we have R+B points: R spaceships and B bases (and R=B).\n\n How to check for non-intersecting connections?\n\n We are to assign each spaceship to a base. There are R! (factorial) assignments. Since R, B <= 10, but note that R=B and maximum 10, so 10! is about 3.6 million which is acceptable for a computer? But wait, we have to check for non-intersecting edges for each complete matching.\n\n However, note: the problem says that no three points are collinear and no two coincide. But the edges are drawn between spaceships and bases (so two sets). The condition is that the straight lines (edges) do not intersect.\n\n But note: the edges are only between the two sets. So we have a bipartite graph. The edges are drawn from one set (spaceships) to the other (bases). The condition is that the edges do not cross.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n For two edges (a->b) and (c->d) (where a, c are spaceships and b, d are bases), they do not intersect if and only if the four points form a convex quadrilateral and the diagonals are the two edges? Actually, two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) in the plane do not intersect if and only if the points lie in a non-crossing configuration.\n\n However, note: the edges are from a set of points (spaceships) to another set (bases). We can use the standard method to check if two segments (A-B) and (C-D) intersect. But note: our edges are only between the two sets, so the four endpoints are from two different sets.\n\n Standard segment intersection check: two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect if and only if the two points p2, q2 are on opposite sides of the line p1q1 and the two points p1, q1 are on opposite sides of the line p2q2.\n\n However, we are going to check for a complete matching (i.e., a set of R edges that form a matching) without any two edges crossing.\n\n But note: the entire set of edges must be non-crossing. This is similar to drawing a planar graph. One known fact: the set of edges in a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} can be drawn without crossings by connecting the two sets in order (like a convex position). \n\n However, our points are arbitrary. We are allowed to assign arbitrarily. We are to decide if there exists an assignment (a permutation) such that the edges do not cross.\n\n Another idea: we can fix an order of the spaceships and an order of the bases, and then check if the matching is non-crossing.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Sort the spaceships by x-coordinate (or any coordinate) and similarly the bases by x-coordinate.\n\n 2. Then, consider the matching: connect the i-th spaceship (in sorted order) to the i-th base (in sorted order). This is called the \"monotone matching\" or \"canonical matching\" and is known to be non-crossing if the two sets are in convex position? Actually, even if the sets are not in convex position, the matching by sorted order might not be the only one, but note: we can use the following:\n\n We know that if we sort both sets by x, then the matching that connects the i-th smallest spaceship to the i-th smallest base is non-crossing? Not necessarily. Consider:\n\n Spaceships: (0,0), (2,0)\n Bases: (-2,1), (0,3)\n\n Sort spaceships by x: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n Sort bases by x: [ (-2,1), (0,3) ]\n\n Matching: (0,0) -> (-2,1); (2,0) -> (0,3)\n\n Now, check the segments: \n   Segment1: from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n   Segment2: from (2,0) to (0,3)\n\n Do they intersect? Let's check:\n\n Equation for segment1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): parametric form: (x,y) = (0-2t, 0+t) for t in [0,1].\n Equation for segment2: from (2,0) to (0,3): parametric form: (x,y) = (2-2s, 0+3s) for s in [0,1].\n\n Set equal: \n   0 - 2t = 2 - 2s  => 2s - 2t = 2 => s - t = 1\n   t = 3s\n\n Then: s - 3s = 1 => -2s = 1 => s = -0.5 (not in [0,1])\n\n So they don't intersect.\n\n However, consider a different matching? But wait, we are only considering one matching (the one by sorted order). But the problem is: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. We need to know if there exists any matching that is non-crossing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the following:\n\n 1. We can fix the order of one set (say, sort the spaceships by x). Then, for the bases, we can choose an order. The non-crossing condition for two edges (a,b) and (c,d) (with a, c being spaceships and b, d bases) is independent of the matching. But note: we are going to assign each spaceship to a base.\n\n There is a known fact: In a bipartite graph with two sets of points, we can check for the existence of a non-crossing matching by:\n\n  - Sorting one set (say, the spaceships) by x.\n  - Then, the bases must be matched in increasing order of x (or decreasing) but we have to check consistency.\n\n Actually, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the spaceships by x (if same x, by y).\n  Step 2: Sort the bases by x (if same x, by y).\n\n  Then, we consider the matching that connects the i-th spaceship to the i-th base. But is this matching always non-crossing? No, not necessarily. However, if we can find a matching that is non-crossing, then the above matching might be one candidate.\n\n But wait, there is a theorem: \n\n Given two sets of points (left and right) in the plane, a non-crossing matching exists if and only if the following holds:\n\n  Sort the left set by x, and the right set by x. Then, the matching that connects the i-th left point to the i-th right point is non-crossing.\n\n However, let me test with a counterexample:\n\n  Spaceships (left): (0,0), (0,2)\n  Bases (right): (1,1), (1,3)\n\n  Sort spaceships: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n  Sort bases: [(1,1), (1,3)]\n\n  Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (1,3). These two segments are vertical and horizontal? Actually, they are two vertical lines (from (0,0) to (1,1)) and (0,2) to (1,3). They do not intersect.\n\n  But what if we swap the bases?\n\n  Matching: (0,0) to (1,3) and (0,2) to (1,1). Now, the segments are (0,0)-(1,3) and (0,2)-(1,1). These two segments cross? Let's check:\n\n  Segment1: (0,0) to (1,3): equation y = 3x\n  Segment2: (0,2) to (1,1): equation y = -x + 2\n\n  They intersect at: 3x = -x+2 => 4x=2 => x=0.5, y=1.5. And 0.5 is between 0 and 1 for both, so they do cross.\n\n  However, the above matching (by sorted order) is non-crossing, but the swapped one is crossing. But note: we are allowed to choose any matching. The problem is to check existence.\n\n  But note: the sorted order matching is non-crossing, so we can output \"Yes\".\n\n  However, what if the sorted order matching is crossing? Then we must try other matchings.\n\n Since R, B <= 10, we can iterate over all permutations (which is factorial). But note: we have two sets of 10 points, so 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in Python if we do it carefully.\n\n Approach:\n\n  Step 1: If R != B, output \"No\".\n  Step 2: Read the points.\n  Step 3: Generate all permutations of the bases (which are B = R points). But note: we have two sets: spaceships and bases. We want to assign each spaceship to a base. So we can fix the order of spaceships (for example, sort them) and then consider a permutation of bases.\n\n  Alternatively, we can fix the order of spaceships and then assign the bases arbitrarily. We have to check if there exists a permutation p of bases (index 0 to R-1) such that when we connect the i-th spaceship (in fixed sorted order) to the base at position p(i), the edges do not cross.\n\n  But note: the condition for non-crossing edges in a set of edges from a fixed set of spaceships (sorted) to a set of bases (assigned by a permutation) is that for any two pairs (i, j) (with i < j) the two edges (spaceship_i -> base_p[i]) and (spaceship_j -> base_p[j]) do not cross.\n\n  How to check if two edges (a->b) and (c->d) cross? We can use the orientation method.\n\n  We define a function ccw(A, B, C) that returns the cross product sign of vectors AB and AC. Then, two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross if and only if:\n\n      (ccw(p1, q1, p2) != ccw(p1, q1, q2)) and (ccw(p1, p2, q1) != ccw(p1, q2, q1))\n\n  But note: our edges are from a set S (spaceships) to a set T (bases). The two edges are (s1, t1) and (s2, t2). The four points are s1, s2, t1, t2. However, the segments are (s1,t1) and (s2,t2). We need to check if these two segments intersect.\n\n  However, note: the edges are drawn from the same set (spaceships) to the other set (bases). The endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear.\n\n  There is a simpler way: two segments (a,b) and (c,d) (where a and b are from set S, and c and d from set T) do not necessarily have the property that the endpoints are interleaved. But we can use the standard segment intersection check.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n  We want to check if the two edges (s1, t1) and (s2, t2) cross. We can check by:\n\n      def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n          def orientation(o, a, b):\n              # returns the cross product sign: positive, negative, or 0\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n          o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n          o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n          o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n          if ((o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)):\n              return True   # they intersect\n\n          # If any three points are collinear, then we have to be cautious, but the problem says no three points are collinear, so we can ignore zeros?\n          # Actually, the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\" So we don't have zeros.\n\n          # However, note: the four points are distinct and no three are collinear, but the segments might still not intersect even if the orientations are not opposite.\n\n          # But wait: the above condition is necessary and sufficient for general segments.\n\n          # However, we must also consider the case where the segments meet at an endpoint? But the problem says the edges are from distinct sets, and the endpoints are distinct. Also, the matching is one-to-one, so the endpoints are distinct.\n\n          # But note: the endpoints of the two edges are distinct because the bases are distinct and the spaceships are distinct.\n\n          # However, the condition above (o1*o2<0 and o3*o4<0) is the standard condition.\n\n          return False\n\n  But wait: the standard condition for two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) to intersect is:\n\n      (orientation(p1, q1, p2) * orientation(p1, q1, q2) < 0) and (orientation(p2, q2, p1) * orientation(p2, q2, q1) < 0)\n\n  However, note: the orientation function should be defined for three points. Let me define:\n\n      def orientation(a, b, c):\n          return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-b[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-b[0])\n\n  Actually, the standard orientation for points a, b, c is:\n\n      (a.x, a.y), (b.x, b.y), (c.x, c.y)\n\n      value = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - b.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - b.x)\n\n  But note: the above condition is for the turn from a->b to a->c. However, the common definition is:\n\n      cross_product = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\n  Actually, wait: the standard way to check if point c is to the left/right of the directed line from a to b is:\n\n      cross_product = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\n  However, the above is the same as:\n\n      cross_product = (a.x*(b.y - c.y) + b.x*(c.y - a.y) + c.x*(a.y - b.y))\n\n  But for segment intersection, we can use the following:\n\n      Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if one of the following is true:\n        1. General case: \n            (orientation(p1, q1, p2) * orientation(p1, q1, q2) < 0) and (orientation(p2, q2, p1) * orientation(p2, q2, q1) < 0)\n\n      However, note: the above condition does not hold if the segments share an endpoint? But in our case, the segments are from two distinct sets, so the endpoints are distinct. And the matching is one-to-one, so the edges are disjoint.\n\n  But wait: the endpoints of the two edges are distinct. So we don't have to worry about sharing an endpoint.\n\n  However, the standard condition for two segments (a,b) and (c,d) to intersect is:\n\n      def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n          def orient(u, v, w):\n              return (v[0]-u[0])*(w[1]-v[1]) - (v[1]-u[1])*(w[0]-v[0])\n\n          o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n          o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n          o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n          o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n          if ((o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)):\n              return True\n          return False\n\n  However, there is a caveat: if one segment is completely contained in the other? But our segments are from two distinct sets and no three points are collinear, so this cannot happen.\n\n  But note: the problem says no three points are collinear, so the four points of the two segments are in general position.\n\n  Now, the plan:\n\n  - If R != B, output \"No\".\n  - Otherwise, read the points.\n  - Sort the list of spaceships (call it S) by their x-coordinate (and if tie, by y).\n  - Generate all permutations of the bases (call it T_perm) of the list of bases (which has length R, since R=B).\n\n  - For each permutation p (which is a list of bases in the order of assignment for S[0], S[1], ..., S[R-1]):\n        Check for every pair (i, j) with 0<=i<j<R: the edge (S[i], p[i]) and (S[j], p[j]) do not intersect.\n\n        If for all pairs the edges do not intersect, then output \"Yes\" and break.\n\n  - If none of the permutations works, output \"No\".\n\n  However, note: the condition for two edges (i and j) is that they do not cross. But note: the edges are from S[i] to p[i] and S[j] to p[j]. We must check that these two edges do not cross.\n\n  But wait: what about edges that are not adjacent? The condition is that no two edges cross. So we must check every pair of edges.\n\n  However, note: the edges are defined by the matching. Since we are assigning one base per spaceship, and the edges are straight lines, the entire set of edges must be non-crossing.\n\n  But note: the edges are drawn from the same set (spaceships) to the bases. The condition that no two edges cross is equivalent to: the set of edges forms a planar embedding.\n\n  However, we are iterating over all permutations. The total number of permutations is R! (which is 10! ~ 3.6e6) and for each permutation we check C(R,2) = 45 pairs (since R<=10). For each pair, we do 4 orientation checks (each orientation is a few multiplications). This should be acceptable.\n\n  But wait: 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6, which is acceptable in Python if we code efficiently.\n\n  However, we can optimize by precomputing the orientations? Or we can use a smarter way to check for crossing in a matching.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n      We have two sets of points. The matching is non-crossing if and only if the following holds:\n\n        Sort the spaceships by x. Sort the bases by x. Then, the matching that assigns the i-th spaceship to the i-th base (in the sorted base list) is non-crossing.\n\n      BUT: wait, the example above showed that swapping the base order might lead to crossing, but the sorted order matching was non-crossing. However, is it always true that if the sorted order matching is non-crossing then the matching exists? Actually, the sorted order matching is one particular matching. The existence of a non-crossing matching is equivalent to the matching by sorted order (if we fix the sorting of one set) being non-crossing? \n\n  Actually, there is a well-known fact: \n\n      In a bipartite matching between two sets of points (with no three collinear) in the plane, there exists a non-crossing matching if and only if the following holds:\n\n          Sort the two sets by x (or by y) and then the matching that connects the i-th element of the first set to the i-th element of the second set is non-crossing.\n\n  However, wait: that is not entirely true. Consider:\n\n      Spaceships: [(0,0), (0,2)] (sorted by x, then y)\n      Bases: [(1,1), (1,3)] (sorted by x, then y)\n\n      The matching by sorted order: (0,0)->(1,1) and (0,2)->(1,3) is non-crossing.\n\n      Now, swap the bases: we get (0,0)->(1,3) and (0,2)->(1,1) which is crossing. But the sorted order matching (without swapping) is non-crossing, so we have found one.\n\n      But what if we have:\n\n      Spaceships: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n      Bases: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n      Sort spaceships by x: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n      Sort bases by x: [ (-1,1), (1,1) ]\n\n      Matching: (0,0) -> (-1,1) and (2,0) -> (1,1)\n\n      Now, check if they cross:\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (-1,1): goes from (0,0) to (-1,1)\n          Segment2: (2,0) to (1,1): goes from (2,0) to (1,1)\n\n      These two segments: \n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (-1,1): equation y = -x\n          Segment2: from (2,0) to (1,1): equation y = -x + 2\n\n      They do not cross because they are parallel and distinct.\n\n      But now, what if we use a different matching? \n\n      Actually, we are trying all permutations. But note: the sorted order matching is the one that matches the i-th smallest to the i-th smallest.\n\n      However, there is a theorem: \n\n          Theorem: A non-crossing bipartite matching exists if and only if there is a non-crossing matching under the natural order (i.e., the one that matches the i-th smallest in the first set to the i-th smallest in the second set) is non-crossing.\n\n      But wait, that is not correct. The existence of a non-crossing matching is independent of the sorted order matching. However, there is a known fact: \n\n          The sorted order matching (by x) is a non-crossing matching if and only if for every i, the i-th smallest base (by x) lies to the same side (left or right) of the line defined by the i-th spaceship and the (i+1)-th spaceship? \n\n      Actually, I recall that in the context of two-pointers, we can use the following greedy algorithm:\n\n          Sort both sets by x.\n          Then, use a stack or two pointers to check if the matching is non-crossing.\n\n      But note: the problem is small (n<=10). We can use brute-force.\n\n  However, there is a more efficient way: \n\n      We can use the following property: \n\n          A set of edges from a set A to set B (both sorted by x) is non-crossing if and only if for every i, j (with i<j) the base assigned to the i-th spaceship is not separated by the base assigned to the j-th spaceship from the i-th spaceship's position relative to the j-th? \n\n      Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          Sort the spaceships by x. Then, for the matching to be non-crossing, the bases must be matched in increasing order of x (or decreasing). But wait, the matching by sorted order is the one that matches increasing to increasing. \n\n      However, here is a known result: \n\n          In a bipartite matching of two sets of points in the plane, the matching is non-crossing if and only if the two sets are interleaved in the same cyclic order (when projected onto a circle) but that is too abstract.\n\n  After reconsideration, since n is small (<=10), we can use brute-force (trying all permutations) and check for each permutation if the set of edges is non-crossing.\n\n  Steps for brute-force:\n\n      Read R, B. If R != B: print \"No\", return.\n\n      Read R spaceships and B bases.\n\n      Sort the list of spaceships by x (and if tie, by y).\n\n      Generate all permutations of the bases (length R).\n\n      For each permutation p (which is a list of R bases, so that the i-th spaceship is connected to p[i]):\n\n          Let edges = []\n          For i in range(R):\n              edges.append( (S[i], p[i]) )\n\n          Now, check for every pair (i, j) with i < j: the edges[i] and edges[j] do not cross.\n\n          To check crossing for two edges (a->b) and (c->d):\n\n              We use the orientation method.\n\n          We define:\n\n              def orientation(a, b, c):\n                  # returns the cross product of (b-a) and (c-a)\n                  # But note: we need to check the orientation of c relative to the directed line from a to b.\n                  # Actually, for segment (a,b) and point c, we compute the cross product (b-a)x(c-a)\n                  return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n          However, the standard segment intersection uses:\n\n              def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                  # Check if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect.\n                  def orient(o, a, b):\n                      # Orientation of (a-o) and (b-o)\n                      return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n                  o1 = orient(a, c, b)\n                  o2 = orient(a, d, b)\n                  o3 = orient(c, a, d)\n                  o4 = orient(c, b, d)\n\n                  if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                      return True\n                  else:\n                      return False\n\n          But note: the above function 'orient' is defined for three points and returns the cross product of (a-o) and (b-o). Then, the condition is that the two points c and d are on opposite sides of the line ab, and the two points a and b are on opposite sides of the line cd.\n\n          However, there is a variation: sometimes the orientation function is defined as the cross product (a->o) and (a->b) but that is different.\n\n          Let me define the standard orientation function for three points a, b, c as:\n\n              orient(a, b, c) = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\n          Then, the condition for the two segments (a,b) and (c,d) to intersect is:\n\n              (orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0) and (orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0)\n\n          However, note: the above condition is for the segments (a,b) and (c,d) to intersect. But wait, the standard condition is:\n\n              The four-point condition: \n\n                  (orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0) and (orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0)\n\n          But note: the function orient(a, b, c) tells the side of c relative to the directed line from a to b.\n\n          However, the above condition is the standard one.\n\n  But note: the segments we are checking are from S[i] to p[i] and S[j] to p[j]. We must ensure that we are passing the four points in the correct order.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the segments are from a set S to a set T. The endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      def seg_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n          # a, b, c, d are tuples (x,y)\n          def orient(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          oa = orient(a, b, c)\n          ob = orient(a, b, d)\n          oc = orient(c, d, a)\n          od = orient(c, d, b)\n\n          if (oa * ob < 0) and (oc * od < 0):\n              return True\n          return False\n\n      Then, for a given matching (edges list) we check:\n\n          for i in range(R):\n              for j in range(i+1, R):\n                  if seg_intersect(S[i], p[i], S[j], p[j]):\n                      break the inner loop and try next permutation.\n\n          If we didn't break for any i,j, then we found a matching.\n\n  However, note: the function seg_intersect uses the orientation with respect to the directed line from a to b and from c to d.\n\n  But wait: the standard condition is:\n\n          (orient(a, b, c) * orient(a, b, d) < 0) and (orient(c, d, a) * orient(c, d, b) < 0)\n\n  This condition is symmetric in the two segments.\n\n  But note: the segments are from S[i] to p[i] and from S[j] to p[j]. We can call the function with:\n\n          seg_intersect(S[i], p[i], S[j], p[j])\n\n  However, we must note: the function expects four points: a, b, c, d. The segment is from a to b and from c to d.\n\n  Let me test the function with two segments that do not intersect and two that do.\n\n  Example 1: two segments that do not intersect.\n\n      Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n      Segment2: (2,2) to (3,3)\n\n      These are colinear? But wait, the problem says no three points are collinear. However, we have four points: (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3) are colinear. But the problem states: \"no three points are on the same line\". So we don't have to worry about zeros? Actually, the condition fails because the four points are colinear. But the problem says no three points are collinear, so this example is invalid.\n\n  Example 2: two segments that cross.\n\n      Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n      Segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n      Check with the function:\n\n          a=(0,0), b=(2,2), c=(0,2), d=(2,0)\n\n          orient(a, b, c) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4 > 0\n          orient(a, b, d) = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 0 - 4 = -4 < 0 -> so product is negative -> condition holds for the first part.\n\n          orient(c, d, a) = (2-0)*(0-0) - (0-2)*(0-0) = 0 - 0 = 0 -> wait, but note: the segment from c to d is from (0,2) to (2,0). The point a=(0,0) is on the line? Actually, the four points are colinear? \n\n          Wait, no: the four points (0,0), (2,2), (0,2), (2,0) are not colinear. But the segment (0,2) to (2,0) passes through (1,1) and (0,0) is (0,0). The orientation of a relative to the segment (c,d) is:\n\n          orient(c, d, a) = (d.x - c.x)*(a.y - c.y) - (d.y - c.y)*(a.x - c.x)\n          = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) = 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4\n\n          orient(c, d, b) = (2-0)*(2-2) - (0-2)*(2-0) = 0 - (-2)*2 = 4\n\n          Then, the product is (-4)*4 = -16 < 0.\n\n          So the condition (first part true and second part true) -> returns True.\n\n  Example 3: two segments that do not cross.\n\n      Segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n      Segment2: (1,1) to (1,3)\n\n      These are two vertical lines.\n\n      Check:\n\n          a=(0,0), b=(0,2), c=(1,1), d=(1,3)\n\n          orient(a, b, c) = (0-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 2*1 = -2\n          orient(a, b, d) = (0-0)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 0 - 2 = -2\n          The product is positive -> condition fails.\n\n          So returns False.\n\n  Example 4: two segments that touch at an endpoint? But our sets are disjoint (spaceships and bases are distinct). So no.\n\n  Example 5: two segments that share an interior point? But the problem says no three points are collinear, so that cannot happen.\n\n  Therefore, the function seems correct.\n\n  However, note: the standard condition also includes the possibility",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the spaceships and bases to see if any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (bijection) between two sets of points (spaceships and bases) such that no two connecting lines intersect. The key observation is that if the number of spaceships (R) does not equal the number of bases (B), no such matching exists, and we can immediately return \"No\". Otherwise, we proceed to check all possible permutations of assignments.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: We sort both the spaceships and bases by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates as a secondary criterion) to systematically explore potential matchings.\n   - **Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, we check if the corresponding edges (from sorted spaceships to permuted bases) do not intersect with each other. This involves using an orientation-based method to determine if any two edges cross.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The brute-force approach involves generating all permutations of the bases, which is R! (factorial) in complexity. For each permutation, we check all pairs of edges (O(R^2) operations). Given that R is at most 10, the total operations are manageable (10! * 45 ≈ 162 million operations), which is feasible for modern computing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    points = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        points.append((x, y))\n        \n    spaceships = points[:R]\n    bases = points[R:R+B]\n    \n    def orient(a, b, c):\n        return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n    \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n        \n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    sorted_spaceships = sorted(spaceships, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    base_permutations = list(itertools.permutations(bases))\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in base_permutations:\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                if segments_intersect(sorted_spaceships[i], perm[i], sorted_spaceships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into integers R (number of spaceships) and B (number of bases). If R does not equal B, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2. **Sorting and Permutations**: The spaceships and bases are sorted by their coordinates. All permutations of the bases are generated to explore every possible matching.\n3. **Orientation and Intersection Check**: The `orient` function calculates the cross product to determine the relative orientation of three points. The `segments_intersect` function checks if two line segments intersect using the orientation values.\n4. **Brute-Force Matching Check**: For each permutation of bases, the code checks all pairs of edges (from sorted spaceships to permuted bases) for intersections. If any permutation yields no intersections, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings while leveraging geometric properties to ensure correctness.",
