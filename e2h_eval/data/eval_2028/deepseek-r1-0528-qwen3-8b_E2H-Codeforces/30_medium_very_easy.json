Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players take turns removing the leftmost digit from A and appending it to their own number.\n Each player makes exactly n moves. Initially, both numbers (S1 and S2) are empty.\n\n We have to output a string of 2n characters (each character is either 'H' or 'M') that specifies the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge.\n\n The goal is to maximize the total prize, which is S1 (the number formed by Homer's digits) plus S2 (the number formed by Marge's digits).\n\n However, note: the problem says that the first player gets S1 dollars and the second gets S2 dollars. But in the example input:\n\n Example 1: Input n=2, A='1234' -> Output 'HHMM'\n Example 2: Input n=2, A='9911' -> Output 'HMHM'\n\n Why in the first example we output 'HHMM'? That means:\n   First move: H takes '1' -> S1 becomes \"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n   Second move: H takes '2' -> S1 becomes \"12\", A becomes \"34\"\n   Then M takes '3', then M takes '4'.\n\n So the numbers are: \n   S1 = 12, S2 = 34? Actually, wait: but the total prize is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n Alternatively, if we had done 'HMHM':\n   First: H takes '1' -> S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n   Second: M takes '2' -> S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n   Third: H takes '3' -> S1=\"13\", A=\"4\"\n   Fourth: M takes '4' -> S2=\"24\", total prize = 13+24 = 37.\n\n But wait, the example output for the second input (9911) is 'HMHM'. Let's check:\n\n Example 2: A='9911', n=2.\n   Option 1: 'HHMM': \n        H takes first '9' -> S1=\"9\", A=\"911\"\n        H takes next '9' -> S1=\"99\", A=\"11\"\n        M takes '1' -> S2=\"1\", A=\"1\"\n        M takes '1' -> S2=\"11\", total = 99+11 = 110.\n\n   Option 2: 'HMHM':\n        H takes first '9' -> S1=\"9\", A=\"911\"\n        M takes next '9' -> S2=\"9\", A=\"11\"\n        H takes next '1' -> S1=\"91\", A=\"1\"\n        M takes next '1' -> S2=\"91\", total = 91+91 = 182.\n\n So indeed 'HMHM' gives more.\n\n How do we think?\n\n We have to assign each digit in A (from left to right) to either Homer or Marge, with each getting exactly n digits.\n\n The total prize is the number formed by Homer's digits (interpreted as an integer) plus the number formed by Marge's digits.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from left to right, and the assignment is fixed: the first move is the first digit, then the second, etc.\n\n However, the catch: the assignment of the digits to the two players must be interleaved arbitrarily (but the order of the digits in each player's number is the order of the moves they made). \n\n We cannot change the order of the digits in A. The only thing is that at each step we decide whether the next digit goes to Homer or Marge.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to output the maximum total prize value, only the sequence of moves (which is a string of 2n characters) that achieves the maximum.\n\n However, we must maximize the total prize.\n\n Since n is at most 18 (so 2n is at most 36), we can consider dynamic programming or state-space search.\n\n But note: the state would be (i, j) where i is the number of moves made by Homer and j by Marge, and we have processed the first i+j digits.\n\n However, we also need to know the current partial numbers for both players? That would be too heavy because the numbers can have up to 18 digits, so the numbers can be very large (up to 10^18) and we cannot store the entire number.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We note that the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But the digits are assigned in order, and the value of S1 and S2 depend on which digits are assigned and in what order.\n\n However, observe: the digits are taken from the left of A, so the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant digit.\n\n We can think of the entire process as splitting the 2n-digit number A into two n-digit numbers (possibly with leading zeros). The catch: the two numbers are built by taking the digits in the order they appear, but only the ones assigned to each player.\n\n But note: the assignment must be such that the moves are interleaved arbitrarily. However, the assignment must cover all digits.\n\n The total prize is the sum of two n-digit numbers (each being a contiguous segment of the original A? No, because the digits are taken in order but not necessarily contiguous in A for each player). Actually, the digits for one player are the ones assigned to them in the order of the moves, and similarly for the other.\n\n However, the entire sequence is fixed: the digits are taken from the beginning. The only freedom is: at step k (0-indexed) we assign the (k+1)-th digit to either Homer or Marge.\n\n Then, the value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to Homer (in the order of the moves) and similarly for S2.\n\n We wish to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n But note: the two numbers are built independently. However, the same digit cannot be split between the two.\n\n This is similar to: we are going to form two numbers, and the digits for each number are a subsequence of the original A (without reordering) and the two subsequences together form the entire A, and they are interleaved.\n\n How to compute the maximum?\n\n Since n is small (at most 18), we can use DP with state (i, j) meaning: we have processed i+j digits, and we have assigned i digits to Homer and j digits to Marge (and i+j <= 2n). Then the remaining digits are from index i+j to the end.\n\n However, we cannot store the entire numbers (because they have up to 18 digits, so the numbers are up to 10^18, and we have 2^(2n) states, which is 2^36 ~ 68 billion, which is too many).\n\n Alternatively, we can use state (i, j) and the two numbers are built by the digits we've chosen so far. But storing the two numbers as integers is too heavy (each number has up to 18 digits, and there are C(2n, n) states, which is about 36 choose 18, around 9e9, which is too many).\n\n Another idea: we can use DP that considers the positions and the counts, and then use memoization, but the numbers are too big to store as integers.\n\n But note: we don't actually need the exact numeric values until the end. However, we are maximizing the sum. \n\n We can use DP with state (i, j) and the current values of S1 and S2? But the numbers are too big.\n\n Alternatively, we can think greedily: but the assignment of digits to players is not independent because the same digit cannot be used twice and the order matters.\n\n However, note: the entire set of digits is fixed. The total prize is the sum of two numbers. The two numbers are built by taking the digits in the order they appear, but only the ones assigned to each.\n\n We can consider: the total prize is the sum over each digit d at position k (0-indexed) multiplied by a weight that depends on which player gets it and at which move.\n\n Specifically, if a digit d (which is a character) is assigned to a player at the t-th move (t from 0 to n-1, since each player makes n moves), then its contribution to the total prize is d * (10^(n-1-t)).\n\n Because: for example, if a player gets a digit at the first move, then it is multiplied by 10^(n-1); at the second move, by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n So the total prize is:\n\n   Sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (digit_k) * (10^(n - (player_move_index) - 1))\n\n But note: the move index for a particular digit depends on when the player took it. However, the assignment must be such that the two players take exactly n digits each, and the digits are taken in increasing order of indices.\n\n Therefore, we can assign each digit a base value: if we assign the digit at position k to a player, then the exponent (power of 10) depends on how many moves that player has already made (because the next move will be the next higher power? Actually, no: the move index for a player is fixed by the order of the digits they take. The first digit they take will be the most significant, then the next, etc.\n\n But note: the assignment must be interleaved arbitrarily. However, the order of the digits in a player's number is the order of the moves (i.e., the order of appearance in A). So if a player takes the first, third, and fifth digits, then the first digit is the most significant, then the third, then the fifth.\n\n Therefore, for a given assignment of digits to Homer and Marge, the value for Homer is:\n\n   H_value = 0\n   Let the digits assigned to Homer be d_{i1}, d_{i2}, ..., d_{in} (with i1 < i2 < ... < in).\n   Then, H_value = d_{i1} * (10^(n-1)) + d_{i2} * (10^(n-2)) + ... + d_{in} * (10^0)\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n And the total prize is H_value + M_value.\n\n Now, we can rewrite the total prize as:\n\n   Total = [d_{i1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i2} * 10^(n-2) + ... ] + [d_{j1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{j2} * 10^(n-2) + ... ]\n\n But note: each digit appears exactly once, so we can write:\n\n   Total = d_0 * w_0 + d_1 * w_1 + ... + d_{2n-1} * w_{2n-1}\n\n where w_k is the weight for the k-th digit (0-indexed) which depends on the assignment and the order in which the player picks the digits.\n\n However, the weight for a digit depends on the position (index) in the sequence of moves for the player that picks it.\n\n Specifically, if the digit at position k is picked by a player at the t-th move (t from 0 to n-1), then its weight is 10^(n-1-t).\n\n But note: the same player's moves are in increasing order of the digit's index (because we take the digits from left to right). So the earliest digit taken by a player gets the highest power.\n\n However, the two players have independent sequences. But the interleaving matters: the same digit cannot be split, and the moves are sequential.\n\n But note: the entire assignment is just partitioning the 2n digits into two sets of n digits. However, the order of the digits in the set for a player is fixed (by the increasing index). \n\n Therefore, the total prize is:\n\n   Total = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} d_k * (10^(n - (rank_in_player(k))-1))\n\n But the rank_in_player(k) is the order (starting from 0) in which the player who took d_k picks digits.\n\n However, the rank_in_player(k) is determined by the set of digits assigned to that player: for Homer, the digit at position k is the t-th smallest index (if we consider only Homer's digits) then it gets 10^(n-1-t). Similarly for Marge.\n\n But note: the assignment must be such that the two sets are fixed. Then, we can compute the total prize by:\n\n   For each digit in Homer's set, let the position (index) be p, then the exponent is determined by the order of the indices in Homer's set.\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n However, we are free to choose the partition (as long as each set has n digits). But the problem is that we must output the sequence of moves (i.e., the assignment order) that maximizes the total prize.\n\n But note: the assignment order must be consistent with the fact that we take the digits from left to right and assign them arbitrarily to the two players (but the moves are interleaved arbitrarily). However, the entire assignment is equivalent to choosing a set of n indices for Homer (and the rest for Marge) and then the value for Homer is computed by taking the digits at the chosen indices and ordering them by the index (so the smallest index in Homer's set is the most significant).\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: choose a subset of n indices from {0, 1, ..., 2n-1} for Homer (the rest for Marge) such that:\n\n   Value(Homer) = Σ_{i in Homer's indices} (digit_i) * (10^(n - (rank(i))-1)\n\n   where rank(i) is the number of indices in Homer's set that are less than i (i.e., the order of the digit in the original sequence).\n\n   Similarly for Marge.\n\n And then the total prize is Value(Homer) + Value(Marge).\n\n Now, how to assign the digits to maximize the total?\n\n We can use dynamic programming:\n\n   Let dp[i][j] = the maximum total prize we can get from the prefix of length i+j, having assigned i digits to Homer and j digits to Marge.\n\n But wait, we cannot easily combine the two numbers because the exponents depend on the entire set.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the contribution of each digit in two ways: \n\n   But note: the weight of a digit depends on the entire assignment of the two players (because the rank of a digit in a player's set depends on how many digits from that player we have seen so far and the indices).\n\n However, we can consider the following: \n\n   The total prize is the sum of the two numbers. Each digit d_k is multiplied by a weight that is the sum of the weights from the two players? Actually, no: each digit is used only once.\n\n   But the weight for digit k is: if it is assigned to a player, then its weight is 10^(exponent) where the exponent is determined by the count of digits from that player that occur before it.\n\n   We can precompute the exponent for a digit k if we know the entire assignment? Not without knowing the entire assignment.\n\n Another idea: since n is small (<=18, so 36 digits), we can iterate over all partitions? There are C(36, 18) which is about 9e9, which is too many.\n\n We need a better way.\n\n Observation: the total prize can be expressed as:\n\n   Total = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} d_k * (w_k)\n\n where w_k is:\n\n   If the digit k is assigned to a player, then w_k = 10^(n - (the number of digits assigned to that player among indices < k) - 1)\n\n But the exponent for digit k depends on the assignment of the previous digits to the same player.\n\n We can use DP with state (i, h, m) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n), h is the number of digits assigned to Homer so far, and m is the number of digits assigned to Marge so far. But then we also need to know the count of digits assigned to Homer and Marge that have appeared so far (which is h and m) and the exponent for the next digit if assigned to a player is 10^(n - (current count for that player) - 1).\n\n However, the state would be (i, h, m) and i = h+m. Then we can consider:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = maximum total prize we can achieve for the prefix [0:i] (i digits processed) with h digits for Homer and m for Marge.\n\n Then, when processing the i-th digit (0-indexed, so the next digit is at index i), we have two choices:\n\n   Assign it to Homer: then the contribution is (digit i) * (10^(n - h - 1)), because in Homer's set, the next available position is the (h)-th (0-indexed) and the exponent is n-1-h (since we have already assigned h digits to Homer, so this will be the (h)-th digit, so the exponent is n-1-h).\n\n   Then update state (i+1, h+1, m) with dp[i][h][m] + (digit i) * (10^(n-1-h))\n\n   Similarly, assign to Marge: then the contribution is (digit i) * (10^(n-1-m))\n\n   Then update state (i+1, h, m+1) with dp[i][h][m] + (digit i) * (10^(n-1-m))\n\n But note: the entire assignment must have exactly n for each, so we iterate until h+m=2n.\n\n However, the exponent for a digit is determined by the total number of digits already assigned to that player (which is h for Homer and m for Marge) at the time we assign the current digit.\n\n But wait: the exponent for a digit is the power of 10 corresponding to the position in the player's number. The first digit (the one assigned first) is the most significant (exponent n-1), then n-2, etc.\n\n In our DP, when we assign a digit to Homer, we are effectively putting it at the next available position for Homer, so the exponent is (n-1 - h) because we have already placed h digits (each using one exponent from n-1 down to n-h). So the next one is n-1-h.\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n The state space: i from 0 to 36, h from 0 to 18, m from 0 to 18. The total states: 37 * 19 * 19 = 37*361 = about 13357, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must consider that the exponentiation: we are multiplying by powers of 10. But note: the digits are characters, so we convert to integers.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read n, then the string A (of length 2n)\n\n   Let total_digits = 2*n\n\n   Precompute the powers of 10: we need powers from 0 to n-1.\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = maximum total prize from the prefix [0:i) (i digits processed) with h for Homer and m for Marge.\n\n   Base: dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\n   Then for i from 0 to total_digits-1:\n        for h from 0 to n:\n            for m from 0 to n:\n                if dp[i][h][m] is set (or we initialize with -infinity for unvisited states) then:\n\n                    Consider two options:\n\n                    Option 1: assign the i-th digit (which is A[i]) to Homer (if h < n)\n                        exponent = n - 1 - h   (because we have h digits already, so the next one is the (h+1)-th, and the exponent is n-1-h)\n                        value_contribution = int(A[i]) * (10**(exponent))\n                        new_state = (i+1, h+1, m)\n                        candidate = dp[i][h][m] + value_contribution\n                        Then update dp[new_state] = max(dp[new_state], candidate)\n\n                    Option 2: assign to Marge (if m < n)\n                        exponent = n - 1 - m\n                        value_contribution = int(A[i]) * (10**(exponent))\n                        candidate = dp[i][h][m] + value_contribution\n                        update dp[i+1][h][m+1] = max(candidate, dp[i+1][h][m+1])\n\n   Then we look for the state (2n, n, n) and then backtrack to find the assignment.\n\n However, we must output the sequence of moves (a string of length 2n, with 'H' and 'M').\n\n But note: the above DP does not record the path. We can do:\n\n   Instead of storing a single value, we can store the best total prize and also the decision (whether the last digit was assigned to H or M) or we can store the entire path? That would be too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can store the parent pointers: for each state (i, h, m), we record the previous state and the move (H or M) that led to it.\n\n Steps for backtracking:\n\n   We'll create a 3D array (or dictionary) for dp, and also a 3D array (or dictionary) for parent: parent[i][h][m] = (prev_i, prev_h, prev_m, move) where move is either 'H' or 'M' for the last assignment.\n\n   But note: we have two transitions. We can record:\n\n        dp[i][h][m] = (max_value, last_move) OR we can separate the information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store:\n\n        dp[i][h][m] = (best_value, prev_state_H, prev_state_M) but that is messy.\n\n   Better: we can store:\n\n        dp[i][h][m] = best_value\n        and then have two arrays: \n            parent_H[i][h][m] = the previous state (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev) and that we came from H (so the current digit was assigned to H) and the previous state is (i-1, h-1, m)\n            parent_M[i][h][m] = similarly.\n\n   But then we have two possibilities.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store:\n\n        choice[i][h][m] = the move that was made at the i-th digit (if any) to get to (i, h, m). But note: we don't know the move at the i-th digit because the state (i, h, m) can be reached by two different moves (if the last digit was assigned to H, then h_prev = h-1, m_prev = m; if by M, then h_prev = h, m_prev = m-1). \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let dp[i][h][m] = maximum total prize for the prefix ending at i (i digits processed) with h for Homer and m for Marge.\n\n        Then we can store:\n\n            from_H[i][h][m] = True if the last move was H and the state (i, h, m) was achieved by assigning the i-1-th digit to H (then i-1 must be the last digit) and h>=1, then the previous state is (i-1, h-1, m)\n\n            Similarly for M.\n\n        Then we can backtrack from (2n, n, n) by checking:\n\n            If the last move was H, then we set the last character to 'H', and go to state (2n-1, n-1, n)\n\n            If the last move was M, then we set the last character to 'M', and go to state (2n-1, n, n-1)\n\n        But note: the state (i, h, m) is defined for i = h+m.\n\n        So we can store:\n\n            parent[i][h][m] = (prev_i, prev_h, prev_m, move) but we don't need to store the move if we can recover it from the changes in h and m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the move that was made at the i-th digit (if we consider the i-th digit as the next to process) but the state (i, h, m) is after processing i digits.\n\n        Actually, we can store:\n\n            dp[i][h][m] = (value, from_H, from_M) but that is redundant.\n\n   Let me design the DP table and the parent table separately.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\n      For i from 0 to 2n-1:\n          for h from 0 to n:\n              for m from 0 to n:\n                  if i != h+m: skip (shouldn't happen, but anyway)\n                  if dp[i][h][m] is set:\n\n                      Consider two possibilities for the next digit (if available):\n\n                      Possibility 1: assign the next digit (at index i) to Homer (if h < n)\n                          new_i = i+1, new_h = h+1, new_m = m\n                          exponent = n - 1 - h   # because the next digit for Homer is the h-th (0-indexed) so exponent is n-1-h\n                          contribution = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                          new_value = dp[i][h][m] + contribution\n                          if new_value > dp[new_i][new_h][new_m]:\n                              dp[new_i][new_h][new_m] = new_value\n                              # and record parent: parent[new_i][new_h][new_m] = (i, h, m, 'H')\n\n                      Possibility 2: assign to Marge (if m < n)\n                          new_i = i+1, new_h = h, new_m = m+1\n                          exponent = n - 1 - m\n                          contribution = int(A[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                          new_value = dp[i][h][m] + contribution\n                          if new_value > dp[new_i][new_h][new_m]:\n                              dp[new_i][new_h][new_m] = new_value\n                              parent[new_i][new_h][new_m] = (i, h, m, 'M')\n\n      Then, after filling dp[2n][n][n], we backtrack:\n\n          Let s = '' (the sequence of moves, from last to first, then reverse)\n          At state (2n, n, n): \n             Check the parent: if the last move was 'H', then we append 'H' and go to state (2n-1, n-1, n)\n             Otherwise, append 'M' and go to state (2n-1, n, n-1)\n\n          We continue until we reach (0,0,0).\n\n      But note: the DP state (i, h, m) corresponds to having processed i digits, and the next digit is at index i (the i-th digit, 0-indexed). So the last digit processed is at index i-1.\n\n      However, in our DP we are processing the i-th digit (from 0 to 2n-1) and updating state (i+1, ...). So the backtracking is from the final state (2n, n, n) and we know the last move (either H or M) that led to it.\n\n      But wait: we stored the parent as (i, h, m, move) meaning that to get to (i+1, h, m) we came from (i, h_prev, m_prev) and the move at the i-th digit was the given move.\n\n      Actually, in our update: we are at state (i, h, m) and we are updating state (i+1, h+1, m) (for H) and (i+1, h, m+1) for M.\n\n      Then the parent of (i+1, h+1, m) is (i, h, m) and the move is 'H'.\n\n      So we can store:\n\n          parent[i+1][h+1][m] = (i, h, m, 'H')\n\n      Then to backtrack, we start at (2n, n, n) and then:\n\n          while state != (0,0,0):\n              (i, h, m) = current state, and we know the move that got us here (say move_char) and the previous state is (i-1, h_prev, m_prev) where if move_char is 'H', then h_prev = h-1, m_prev = m, and if 'M', then h_prev = h, m_prev = m-1.\n\n      But note: the state (i, h, m) has i = h+m. So we can reconstruct the previous state from the move.\n\n      Alternatively, we can store the previous state and the move.\n\n      However, we can also store:\n\n          from_H[i][h][m] = the state (i-1, h-1, m) and the move was H (if h>0 and the state (i-1, h-1, m) exists and led to (i, h, m) by H)\n\n          Similarly for M.\n\n      Then backtracking:\n\n          current_state = (2n, n, n)\n          s = []\n          while current_state != (0,0,0):\n              i, h, m = current_state\n              if we came from H (meaning the last move was H) then the previous state is (i-1, h-1, m) and we append 'H'\n              else (from M) then previous state is (i-1, h, m-1) and we append 'M'\n\n          Then reverse s.\n\n      But we need to know which one to choose. We can store two things: the best way to get to (i, h, m) and which move was last.\n\n      We'll store:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = maximum total prize for state (i, h, m)\n\n          and\n\n          move[i][h][m] = the last move ('H' or 'M') that was used to get to (i, h, m)\n\n          Then we can backtrack by:\n\n            s = []\n            i, h, m = 2*n, n, n\n            while (i, h, m) != (0,0,0):\n                if move[i][h][m] == 'H':\n                    s.append('H')\n                    i, h, m = i-1, h-1, m\n                else:\n                    s.append('M')\n                    i, h, m = i-1, h, m-1\n            s.reverse()\n\n      However, note: the state (i, h, m) is defined for i = h+m. So when we subtract 1 from i, we must subtract 1 from either h or m.\n\n      But in our DP update, we update from (i, h, m) to (i+1, h+1, m) and (i+1, h, m+1). So the backtracking goes from (i, h, m) to (i-1, h-1, m) or (i-1, h, m-1).\n\n      But note: the state (i, h, m) must satisfy i = h+m. So when we backtrack from (i, h, m) by removing one digit, we must have i-1 = (h-1)+m (if we removed from H) or i-1 = h+(m-1) (if we removed from M). And indeed, i = h+m, so i-1 = (h+m)-1, and if we remove one from H then (h-1+m) = i-1, similarly for M.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          dp[0][0][0] = 0\n          Then for i from 0 to 2n-1:\n              for h from 0 to n:\n                  for m from 0 to n:\n                      if i != h+m: continue   (though i should be h+m, but we might have multiple ways to get to the same (i,h,m) from different paths, but i is fixed as h+m, so we can iterate i from 0 to 2n, and then h from 0 to min(n, i) and m = i - h, but we have to ensure h<=n and m<=n)\n\n          Actually, we can optimize by iterating i from 0 to 2n, and then h from 0 to min(i, n) and m = i - h, and then check m<=n.\n\n      But note: we are going to use a 3D array for dp, so we can do:\n\n          dp = [[[ -10**18 ]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(2*n+1)]\n\n          Then initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\n          Then for i in range(0, 2*n):\n              for h in range(0, n+1):\n                  for m in range(0, n+1):\n                      if i != h+m: continue   # we can skip because the state (i, h, m) must have i==h+m, but we are iterating h and m independently and then i=h+m, so we can set i = h+m and then use two nested loops for h and m from 0 to n, but then i is fixed.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          for i in range(0, 2*n):\n              for h in range(0, n+1):\n                  m = i - h\n                  if m < 0 or m > n:\n                      continue\n\n          Then we update from state (i, h, m) to (i+1, h+1, m) and (i+1, h, m+1) if within bounds.\n\n      But note: the above condition: we are at state (i, h, m) and then we assign the next digit (index i) to H or M.\n\n      However, the digit we are processing is the i-th digit (0-indexed). But in our state (i, h, m) we have processed i digits. Then the next digit is the i-th digit (if we consider that we have processed 0 to i-1, then the next is i). \n\n      Actually, we are indexing the string A from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Let dp[i][h][m] be the state after processing the first i digits (indices 0 to i-1). Then the next digit is at index i.\n\n          Then the exponent for assigning the digit at index i to Homer is: n - 1 - h   (because we have already h digits for Homer, so the next one is the h-th digit, and the exponent is n-1-h)\n\n          Similarly for Marge.\n\n      Then the update:\n\n          dp[i+1][h+1][m] = max( dp[i+1][h+1][m], dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)) )   if h < n\n          dp[i+1][h][m+1] = max( dp[i+1][h][m+1], dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m)) )   if m < n\n\n      Then we want dp[2n][n][n].\n\n      Then backtracking: we need to store the move that was taken at each state.\n\n      We can use two 3D arrays: dp[i][h][m] for the value, and a 3D array move[i][h][m] which is None if not visited, or the move taken (either 'H' or 'M').\n\n      Steps:\n\n          dp = a 3D array of dimensions [2*n+1][n+1][n+1] filled with -10**18 (or a very small number) for unvisited states.\n          move = same dimensions, filled with None.\n\n          dp[0][0][0] = 0\n          move[0][0][0] = None   # no move\n\n          Then for i from 0 to 2*n-1:\n              for h in range(0, n+1):\n                  for m in range(0, n+1):\n                      if i != h+m: continue   # skip invalid states, but we are iterating by i and then h, m, so we can enforce by the condition below.\n                      # Actually, we can iterate by i from 0 to 2*n, and then h from 0 to min(i, n) and m from 0 to min(i, n) and then m = i - h, but then we have only one state per i.\n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate by i from 0 to 2*n-1, and then h from 0 to min(i, n) and m = i - h, but then we must check m<=n.\n\n          But note: i = h+m, so we can do:\n\n          for i in range(0, 2*n):\n              for h in range(0, min(i, n)+1):\n                  m = i - h\n                  if m > n: continue   # but since i<=2*n and h>=0, then m = i-h <= i <=2*n, but we require m<=n, so if m>n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The goal is to assign each digit to one of the players such that both players end up with exactly n digits, and the sum of their numbers (formed by their picked digits) is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the 2n-digit number A into two n-digit numbers (one for each player) such that the sum of these two numbers is maximized. The key observation is that the value of each digit depends on its position in the respective player's number. The leftmost digit picked by a player contributes the most to their number's value (highest place value).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][h][m]` represents the maximum total prize achievable after processing the first `i` digits, with `h` digits assigned to Homer and `m` digits assigned to Marge. The transitions involve assigning the next digit to either player, updating the state accordingly.\n\n3. **State Transitions**: For each digit at position `i`, we consider two possibilities:\n   - Assign it to Homer, contributing `digit * 10^(n-1-h)` to the total prize, where `h` is the count of digits already assigned to Homer.\n   - Assign it to Marge, contributing `digit * 10^(n-1-m)` to the total prize, where `m` is the count of digits already assigned to Marge.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the state `(2n, n, n)` to determine the sequence of moves (Homer or Marge) that led to the maximum prize. This involves reversing the path taken during the DP computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    \n    dp = [[[ -10**18 ] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    move = [[[ None for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    \n    dp[0][0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(0, total_digits):\n        for h in range(0, n+1):\n            m = i - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            if dp[i][h][m] == -10**18:\n                continue\n            if h < n:\n                exponent = n - 1 - h\n                new_value = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                if new_value > dp[i+1][h+1][m]:\n                    dp[i+1][h+1][m] = new_value\n                    move[i+1][h+1][m] = 'H'\n            if m < n:\n                exponent = n - 1 - m\n                new_value = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10 ** exponent)\n                if new_value > dp[i+1][h][m+1]:\n                    dp[i+1][h][m+1] = new_value\n                    move[i+1][h][m+1] = 'M'\n                    \n    s = []\n    i_state = total_digits\n    h_state = n\n    m_state = n\n    while (i_state, h_state, m_state) != (0, 0, 0):\n        if move[i_state][h_state][m_state] == 'H':\n            s.append('H')\n            i_state -= 1\n            h_state -= 1\n        else:\n            s.append('M')\n            i_state -= 1\n            m_state -= 1\n            \n    s.reverse()\n    print(''.join(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` and the number `A`. It initializes a 3D DP array to store the maximum prize values and a 3D `move` array to record the last move (Homer or Marge) for each state.\n\n2. **DP Table Population**: The nested loops iterate over each digit position, updating the DP table by considering whether the current digit should be assigned to Homer or Marge. The contribution of each digit is calculated based on its position in the respective player's number.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: Starting from the final state `(2n, n, n)`, the code backtracks through the `move` array to construct the sequence of moves (H and M) that maximizes the total prize. The sequence is reversed to present it in the correct order.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible assignments of digits to players using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring the optimal solution is found without explicitly enumerating all possible partitions.
