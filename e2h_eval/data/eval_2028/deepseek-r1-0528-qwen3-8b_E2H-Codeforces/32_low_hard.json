    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Idea:\n 1. Sort the array and consider the possibilities of removing one element.\n\n Observation:\n After sorting, the array becomes b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1].\n\n The instability of the entire array without removal is b[n-1] - b[0].\n\n Now, if we remove one element, the new array's min and max will be:\n\n   If we remove an element that is not the minimum, then the min remains b[0] (unless we remove the last occurrence of the minimum? but note: there might be duplicates).\n   Similarly, if we remove an element that is not the maximum, then the max remains b[n-1].\n\n However, note that sometimes removing an element in the middle might actually change both the min and the max? Actually no: because we are only removing one element.\n\n But wait: what if the array has duplicates? Then the min and max might appear multiple times.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Without loss of generality, we can consider the following:\n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (min). Then the new array starts at index 1 (if n>=2). The new min would be b[1] (unless all elements are same, then it doesn't matter) and the max is still b[n-1]. So instability = b[n-1] - b[1].\n\n Option 2: Remove the last element (max). Then the new array ends at index n-2. The new max is b[n-2] and the min is still b[0]. So instability = b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n Option 3: Remove an element from the middle. Then the min and max remain the same as the original array (if the removed element was neither the global min nor the global max). However, wait: what if the array has multiple minima and maxima?\n\n Actually, the key is: the min and max of the entire array are fixed by the smallest and largest values. Removing an element that is not the min or the max won't change the min or the max.\n\n But note: if there are duplicates, then the min might appear multiple times. However, if we remove a duplicate of the min, then the new min is still the same (because there is another min). Similarly for the max.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min (or the only occurrence of the max)? Then the min (or max) changes.\n\n So, we must consider:\n\n For each element, we can compute the instability of the array with that element removed.\n\n However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try every removal and compute min and max (which would be O(n) per removal, leading to O(n^2)).\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the instability after removal is:\n   If we remove an element x, then the min becomes min(b[0], ... , x, ... , b[n-1]) without x. Similarly for the max.\n\n But note: we sorted the array. Then:\n\n   Let b = sorted(a)\n\n   The min of the entire array is b[0] and the max is b[-1].\n\n   Consider removing an element at index i (0-indexed). Then:\n\n      If i==0, the new min is b[1] and the max is still b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n      If i==n-1, the new max is b[n-2] and the min is b[0] -> instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n      If i is somewhere in the middle, then the min is still b[0] and the max is still b[-1] unless the element we remove is the last occurrence of the min or the first occurrence of the max.\n\n   However, wait: if we remove an element that is the last occurrence of the min (but not the first) then the min remains b[0] (if there's still one min left). Similarly, if we remove an element that is the first occurrence of the max (but not the last) then the max remains b[-1] (if there's still one max left).\n\n   But note: the min is the smallest value. There might be multiple. So the min is determined by the smallest value remaining. Similarly for the max.\n\n   Actually, the min of the array without the element at index i is:\n        min_value = b[0] if there is at least one occurrence of b[0] in the array after removal, otherwise the next smallest (which would be b[i+1] if i is the last occurrence of b[0]?).\n\n   This seems complicated.\n\n Let's re",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the impact of removing any single element on the min and max values of the array.\n2. **Key Insight**: Removing an element from the sorted array can either:\n   - Keep the min and max unchanged if the removed element is neither the smallest nor the largest (or duplicates of them).\n   - Change the min if the smallest element is removed (and it was the only occurrence).\n   - Change the max if the largest element is removed (and it was the only occurrence).\n3. **Evaluate Removal Options**: \n   - Removing the first element (smallest) sets the new min to the next smallest element, while the max remains the same.\n   - Removing the last element (largest) sets the new max to the previous largest element, while the min remains the same.\n   - Removing any other element leaves both the min and max unchanged.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: For each possible removal, compute the instability and select the minimum value among them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    b = sorted(a)\n    best = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            current_instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            current_instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n        else:\n            current_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n        if current_instability < best:\n            best = current_instability\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing any one will result in an array with a single element, hence instability is zero.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n4. **Iterate Over Elements**: For each element in the sorted array, simulate its removal and compute the resulting instability:\n   - If the first element is removed, the new min is the second element, and the max remains the last element.\n   - If the last element is removed, the new max is the second-to-last element, and the min remains the first element.\n   - For any other element, both min and max remain unchanged, so the instability is the original max minus min.\n5. **Track Minimum Instability**: The smallest instability encountered during the iteration is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the critical elements (first, last, and others) in the sorted array, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
