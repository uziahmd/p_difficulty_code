Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can be any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover with one card is x.\n\n 4. We are allowed to use multiple cards. We want the minimum number of cards.\n\n Observation:\n  - If S == 0, then we need 0 additional cards.\n\n  - Otherwise, we have to fix the deficit (which is -S). But note: we can also use positive and negative numbers arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of cards required to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let deficit = -S (if S is positive, then deficit is negative? Actually, if S is positive, then we need negative numbers, and vice versa).\n\n Actually, we require the sum of the additional cards to be -S.\n\n Since we can choose any numbers in the range [-x, x], the problem reduces to: \n   Represent the target T = -S as a linear combination (with coefficients being counts) of integers in [-x, x] such that the sum of the absolute values of the chosen numbers (or more precisely, the count of cards) is minimized.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use the same card multiple times? Yes, because there are infinitely many cards for each integer.\n\n However, we can think greedily:\n\n  Consider: what is the maximum absolute value we can cover in one card? x.\n\n  So, one card can change the sum by at most x (if we choose a positive x) or at least -x (if we choose a negative x). \n\n  But note: we might need to cover a deficit that is not necessarily a multiple of x. However, we are allowed to use both positive and negative cards arbitrarily.\n\n  Actually, we can break down the problem:\n\n  Let T = -S.\n\n  We want to minimize k (number of cards) such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) such that a1+a2+...+ak = T.\n\n  How to do that?\n\n  The key is that we can use both positive and negative cards. However, note that the maximum absolute value per card is x.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  In one card, we can adjust the total by at most x (in absolute value). So, if |T| <= x, then we can use one card.\n\n  But wait: what if T is positive? Then we need a card with value T (and since |T|<=x, we can use one card). Similarly, if T is negative, we use a card with value T.\n\n  However, what if |T| > x?\n\n  Then we might need multiple cards.\n\n  Example: T = 5, x = 2 -> we cannot use one card because no card has value 5 (since |card|<=2). But we can use two cards: 2+2=4 -> not enough, but wait: 2+2+1? Actually, wait, we are allowed to use any integers in [-2,2]. So we can use three cards: 2+2+1=5? But wait, 1 is allowed. Actually, we can use two cards: 2+3? No, because 3 is not allowed. But wait, we can use negative ones too? Actually, we are free to mix positive and negative.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think: we are trying to form T (which can be positive or negative) using the fewest number of cards, each card being in [-x, x].\n\n  This is similar to the coin change problem, but with a twist: we have a very large set of denominations (from -x to x, excluding 0? Actually including 0, but 0 doesn't help). However, note that we are allowed to use any integer in that range arbitrarily.\n\n  Actually, note: the set of achievable sums with k cards is every integer in the range [ -k*x, k*x ] that has the same parity as k*x (if we consider the entire set) but wait, actually we can use negative and positive arbitrarily so the set of achievable sums with k cards is all integers between -k*x and k*x? Not exactly, because we can use zeros too.\n\n  But wait: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x? Not necessarily: for example, with k=1, we can get every integer from -x to x. For k=2, we can get every integer from -2*x to 2*x? Actually, yes, because we can take two numbers from [-x,x] and their sum will be from -2*x to 2*x, and since the step is 1, we can get every integer in between.\n\n  Why? Because if we have two consecutive integers, we can get every integer in between. For example, with x=2, k=2: \n      min: -2 + -2 = -4\n      max: 2+2 = 4\n      and we can get -3: -2 + (-1) = -3, -2+0=-2, -2+1=-1, -2+2=0; then -1+(-1)=-2, etc. So indeed, every integer between -4 and 4 is achievable.\n\n  Similarly, for k cards, we can achieve every integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n  Therefore, the problem reduces to: find the smallest nonnegative integer k such that T is in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n  But note: we are allowed to use k cards, and the condition is: |T| <= k*x.\n\n  Then the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x) ?\n\n  However, let's test with the examples:\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2]\n        S = -1+1+2 = 2, so T = -2.\n        |T| = 2, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(2/2) = ceil(1) = 1 -> matches.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2]\n        S = -4, T = 4.\n        |T|=4, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2 -> matches.\n\n  But wait: what if T=0? Then k_min=ceil(0/x)=0 -> correct.\n\n  However, consider: what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive, so the formula still holds.\n\n  But wait: what if we have T=1, x=10? Then k_min=ceil(1/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if T=0? Then k_min=0, which is correct.\n\n  However, let me test with another example: \n      Suppose T=5, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. \n      But with two cards, the maximum absolute sum is 6 (using two 3's) but we can get 5? \n          3+2=5, but 2 is allowed (since |2|<=3). So yes, two cards.\n\n  What about T=7, x=3? \n      k_min = ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. \n      With 3 cards, the maximum absolute sum is 9, and we can form 7: 3+3+1=7.\n\n  So the formula seems to hold.\n\n  But wait: is it always true that with k cards we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]? \n      We can use the following: \n        We can represent any integer in the range [0, k*x] by using nonnegative combinations? Not exactly, because we are allowed negative numbers too.\n\n  Actually, we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. Then with k cards, the set of achievable sums is the set of integers between -k*x and k*x. Why?\n      We can use the first k-1 cards to adjust the sum arbitrarily within [- (k-1)*x, (k-1)*x] and then the last card can adjust by up to x, so we can cover [-k*x, k*x]. Moreover, because the steps are 1, we can get every integer in between.\n\n  However, note: we are not restricted to nonnegative or nonpositive, so we can use a greedy-like argument: \n      We can use the cards to first get as close as possible to T, but the above reasoning by the range is standard in the theory of linear Diophantine equations when the modulus is 1 (which we have because we can use consecutive integers).\n\n  Therefore, the answer is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  Since k must be an integer, k = ceil(|T| / x) if |T| is not divisible by x, but wait: if |T| is divisible by x, then k = |T|//x.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write: \n      k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n  But note: if |T| is 0, then k=0.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the minimal k must be at least 0 and we are looking for the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  We can compute: k = 0 if T==0, else k = (|T| + x - 1) // x   [ceiling division without floats]\n\n  But wait: what if T is negative? We use |T|, so that's okay.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the initial set of cards includes every integer from -x to x, so we can use negative numbers too.\n\n  But wait: there is a catch. The above reasoning assumed that we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] with k cards. Is that really true?\n\n  Let me check with k=1: yes, we can form every integer from -x to x.\n\n  k=2: we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x. Why?\n        Let S = a + b, where a,b in [-x, x]. Then S can be any integer from -2*x to 2*x. And because the step is 1 (since we can change by 1), we can get every integer in between.\n\n  Similarly, for k=3: we can form every integer from -3*x to 3*x.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  However, wait: what if we need to form T=0? Then k=0, which is correct.\n\n  But note: the problem says that initially he had infinitely many cards. So we can use as many as we want.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n      Read n and x.\n      Read the list of n integers.\n\n      Compute S = sum(list)\n      T = -S\n\n      If T == 0:\n          print(0)\n      Else:\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n          # We need the smallest k such that k*x >= abs_T\n          # k_min = ceil(abs_T / x)\n\n          # Using integer arithmetic: \n          #   If abs_T % x == 0, then k_min = abs_T // x\n          #   Else, k_min = abs_T // x + 1\n\n          # But note: if abs_T is 0, then k_min=0, but we already handled T==0.\n\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This is ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n          print(k_min)\n\n  However, wait: let's test with the examples.\n\n  Example 1: T = -2, abs_T=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n  Example 2: T = 4, abs_T=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n  But wait, what if T=5, x=3: \n        abs_T=5, (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in integer floor division) -> but 2*3=6>=5, so that's correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if T=6, x=3: (6+3-1)//3 = (8)//3 = 2 -> but 2*3=6>=6, so that's correct. But actually, 6 is divisible by 3, so we should get 2, and 2 is correct.\n\n  But wait: 6/3=2, so we need 2 cards. But note: we can form 6 with two cards: 3+3.\n\n  Now, consider T=7, x=3: (7+3-1)//3 = (9)//3=3 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: is there a case where we cannot form T even if k*x >= |T|? \n\n  Actually, note: the above reasoning says that we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x. Therefore, if k*x >= |T|, then |T| <= k*x, so T is in [-k*x, k*x] and hence achievable.\n\n  However, wait: what if T is negative? The same applies because we are using absolute value.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is k_min = ceil(|T| / x).\n\n  But wait: there's a caveat. The problem does not require the cards to be distinct. And we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily. So the above holds.\n\n  However, let me consider a different example: \n      n=1, x=10, cards=[10] -> S=10, T=-10, |T|=10 -> k_min = ceil(10/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  Another: n=1, x=10, cards=[9] -> S=9, T=-9, |T|=9 -> ceil(9/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if T=1? Then k_min=ceil(1/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if T=0? Then k_min=0, correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if T=11, x=10? \n        ceil(11/10)=2 -> correct, because we need two cards: for example, 10+1, but 1 is allowed (since |1|<=10).\n\n  But wait: what if T=1000, x=1? Then k_min=ceil(1000/1)=1000 -> correct, because we need 1000 cards of 1 to make 1000, but wait: we need to make T=-1000? Actually, T=1000? Wait, no: T=-S, if S=1000 then T=-1000. Then we need to form -1000. With x=1, each card can be -1. So we need 1000 cards of -1. So k_min=1000.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the maximum absolute value is x. So with x=1, the available numbers are -1,0,1.\n\n  But wait: we don't have to use only negatives. We can use positives and negatives arbitrarily. But to form -1000, we must use at least 1000 cards (each contributing at most -1). Similarly, if T=1000, then we must use at least 1000 cards (each contributing at most 1).\n\n  Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n  BUT WAIT: There is a nuance. The above reasoning that we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x] is valid because we can use any integer from -x to x. However, note that we are allowed to use zeros. But zeros don't help in changing the sum. However, the set of achievable sums is still the entire interval because we can use non-zero numbers arbitrarily.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not restrict the number of cards we use (except we want the minimum). So zeros are allowed but they don't change the sum, so we would never choose to use a zero unless we have to? Actually, we don't need to use zeros because we can use positive and negative numbers arbitrarily to reach the target.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      total = sum(cards)\n      T = -total\n\n      if T == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n          # Calculate the minimal k: the smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_T\n          # k_min = ceil(abs_T / x)\n          # Using integer arithmetic for ceiling division for positive numbers:\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n          print(k_min)\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> total = -1+1+2 = 2, T=-2, abs_T=2.\n        k_min = (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total = -4, T=4, abs_T=4.\n        k_min = (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n  But wait, what if the deficit T is negative and large? Let's try T=-5, x=2:\n        abs_T=5, k_min = (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2=3 -> correct because 3 cards: maximum negative is -6, and we can form -5 by, say, -2, -2, -1.\n\n  However, wait: what if T=3, x=2? \n        abs_T=3, k_min = (3+2-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> correct. We can form 3 with two cards: 2+1 (but 1 is allowed, so yes). Or 3=2+1.\n\n  But wait: what if T=1, x=10? Then k_min=ceil(1/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if T=0? We handled that.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is very small? For example, T=1, x=1000 -> ceil(1/1000)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n  However, note: there is a possibility that the deficit is fractional? No, because T is the negative of the sum of integers, so T is an integer.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(cards)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n  However, wait: there's a catch. The above reasoning is based on the fact that with k cards we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x. But note: the problem does not require the cards to be distinct. We are allowed to use the same card multiple times.\n\n  However, the above reasoning holds because we can use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any cards, so 0.\n\n  However, consider a different scenario: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1? Then k_min=ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n  One more edge: n=0? The problem says n>=1, so we don't have to handle n=0.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says \"The second line contains n space-separated integers\", so n>=1.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is negative and the absolute value is very large? Our formula uses integer arithmetic and should work.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? We handled that.\n\n  But wait: there's an alternative way. We can also consider that we might be able to use fewer cards if we use negative numbers to cancel out? Actually, no: the deficit is fixed. We need to achieve the exact total.\n\n  However, note: the problem allows mixing positive and negative. But the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value of the deficit and the maximum absolute value per card.\n\n  Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n  But wait: let me read the example again: \n      Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> deficit is 4, and we said 2 cards.\n\n  Why can't we use one card? Because the maximum absolute value of a card is 3, so one card can give at most 3. 3 < 4, so we need at least two cards.\n\n  Similarly, in the first example, deficit is 2, and one card of -2 is allowed (since 2<=x=2).\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=2? Then we need two cards: for example, -2 and -1 (to get -3). The deficit is 3, so we need to add -3. But wait, our deficit is positive? Actually, in our calculation we use the absolute value. But wait, the deficit is defined as T = -S. So if S is negative, then T is positive, meaning we need to add positive numbers. \n\n  However, the problem: we need to make the total sum 0. If the current sum is S, then we need to add a set of cards that sum to -S.\n\n  The set of cards we can use is symmetric. So the minimal number of cards is independent of the sign.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n  However, wait: the problem statement example 2: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        Output: \"2\"\n\n  Our solution returns 2.\n\n  But wait: what if we have deficit 0? We return 0.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1000? We return 1.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1? We return 1.\n\n  What if the deficit is 1 and x=2? We return ceil(1/2)=1.\n\n  All these seem correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 2 and x=1? Then we need two cards: because one card can only contribute up to 1 (in absolute value). So two cards: 1+1=2. So k_min=ceil(2/1)=2.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(a)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  However, wait: I just realized that the problem statement says:\n\n      \"In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\"\n\n  But wait: in the second sample, the found cards are [-2, -2] so S=-4, so T=4. They say he needs two cards with number 2. But why two cards? Because one card can only be at most 3 (absolute value). But 2 is allowed, and 2 is less than 3. However, 4 is the deficit, so we need two cards of 2 (each) because 2+2=4.\n\n  But wait: we could also use one card of 4? No, because 4 is greater than x=3. So we cannot use one card. \n\n  However, wait: the problem says the cards are from -3 to 3. So 4 is not allowed. But note: the deficit is 4, so we need to add 4. We can use two 2's because 2<=3.\n\n  But wait: what if we use one card of 3 and one card of 1? 3+1=4, and both are allowed. So why does the example say two cards with number 2? It could be any two cards that add to 4. But the minimal number is still two.\n\n  The example output is 2.\n\n  So the code is correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 4 and x=3, and we use two cards: 3 and 1. That works. So the minimal number is still 2.\n\n  The formula: ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is robust.\n\n  Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> sum=2, T=-2, abs_T=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 (in Python, 3//2 is 1) -> prints 1.\n\n  Example 2: \n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> sum=-4, T=4, abs_T=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> prints 2.\n\n  But wait: the example input is given as a string: '2 3\\n-2 -2'\n\n  However, the problem says the input format is two lines.\n\n  We read the first line with two integers, then the next line with n integers.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(a)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0? We handled that.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 0, but the list is empty? But n>=1, so the list is not empty.\n\n  One more test: \n      n=1, x=10, cards=[0] -> S=0, T=0 -> output 0.\n\n  Another: n=1, x=10, cards=[5] -> S=5, T=-5, abs_T=5, k=(5+10-1)//10=14//10=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 10? Then k_min=ceil(10/10)=1 -> correct.\n\n  What if deficit is 11? Then k_min=ceil(11/10)=2.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is -1? Then T=-1, abs_T=1, k_min=ceil(1/x). For x>=1, that's 1.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but we didn't handle the case when T==0? We did: we print 0.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but the list is not empty? For example, [1, -1] -> sum=0, then T=0 -> 0 cards.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards. So even if the deficit is 0, we don't need to find any card.\n\n  Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n  But wait: the problem statement says:\n\n      \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n  And the example input is given as a string: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n  But wait, the example input is two separate examples. Actually, the problem reads from stdin.\n\n  We assume one test case per run.\n\n  However, the problem says:\n\n      Input: \n          First line: n and x\n          Second line: n integers\n\n  So we read one test case.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(a)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  Let me submit this.\n\n  But wait: wait, wait! There is a flaw.\n\n  Consider: what if the deficit is 0, but we have a non-zero sum? No, if the sum is 0 then deficit is 0.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but we are forced to use a card? No, the goal is to have the sum zero, and if the current sum is already zero, then we don't need any card.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 0, but the problem requires at least one card? No, the problem doesn't say that. The goal is to have the sum zero, and if we already have zero, then we don't need to add anything.\n\n  Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n  But wait: the example outputs are 1 and 2, and our code produces 1 and 2.\n\n  However, wait: I just thought of an example: \n      n=2, x=1, cards=[1,0] -> sum=1, deficit=-1. Then k_min=ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n  Another: n=2, x=1, cards=[1,1] -> sum=2, deficit=-2 -> k_min=ceil(2/1)=2 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=2? Then k_min=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. But wait, can we form 3 with two cards? Each card can be at most 2 (positive) or at least -2 (negative). To form 3, we need two cards: 2+1=3, but wait: 1 is allowed because |1|<=2? Yes. So two cards.\n\n  However, wait: what if we use two cards: 2 and 1, that's two cards. But the deficit is 3, so we need to add 3. The cards we add must sum to 3. The set {1,2} is allowed. So two cards.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=2, but we use three cards: 1+1+1=3. That's three cards, but we found that two cards are sufficient.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal k is 2.\n\n  The formula: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=1? Then k_min=ceil(3/1)=3. Correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=3? Then ceil(3/3)=1 -> correct, because one card of 3.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=4? Then ceil(3/4)=1 -> correct.\n\n  So the formula holds.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(a)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait: wait, wait! There is an important catch.\n\n  The above reasoning that we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] is correct. However, note that the deficit must be achieved by adding the cards. But the cards we add must be integers between -x and x. \n\n  However, the above formula gives the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|. But note: we are allowed to use negative numbers as well. But wait, the deficit T might be negative, but we use absolute value, so we are effectively solving |T| <= k*x.\n\n  But wait: the minimal k is the smallest integer k for which k*x >= |T|.\n\n  However, note: the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers in [-k*x, k*x]. Therefore, |T| must be <= k*x.\n\n  So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T| / x).\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  Let me submit.\n\n  But wait: wait, wait again.\n\n  Consider: what if the deficit is 0? We output 0.\n\n  What if the deficit is 1? We output ceil(1/x). For x>=1, ceil(1/x)=1.\n\n  What if the deficit is 2? ceil(2/x). For x=1 -> 2, for x=2 -> 1, for x>=3 -> 1.\n\n  But wait: for x=2, deficit=2: one card of 2 is allowed, so 1 is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 2 and x=3? Then ceil(2/3)=1 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the deficit is 2 and x=1? Then ceil(2/1)=2 -> correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 2 and x=2? Then ceil(2/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n  So the code is correct.\n\n  But wait: wait, wait, wait! There is a catch.\n\n  The catch: the above reasoning that we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x is only true if we can use any integer from -x to x. But note: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. However, the problem does not say we can use zeros arbitrarily. But zeros don't help, and we are allowed to use them, but we are minimizing the number of cards. So we don't need to use zeros.\n\n  However, the set of achievable sums is still the entire interval because we can use non-zero numbers arbitrarily. For example, to form 1 with k=1 and x=1, we use 1. To form 1 with k=1 and x=2, we use 1. To form 1 with k=1 and x=3, we use 1.\n\n  But wait: what if we want to form 1 with k=2 and x=1? Then we can use 1+0, but zeros are allowed. However, we are minimizing the number of cards, so we wouldn't use two cards if one is enough.\n\n  The minimal k is the smallest k for which k*x >= |T|, and we can form T with k cards.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  However, wait: there is one more example.\n\n      n=1, x=10, cards=[10] -> deficit=-10, |T|=10, k_min=ceil(10/10)=1.\n\n      But wait, how do we form -10? We use one card of -10. And |10|<=x? x=10, so yes, -10 is allowed.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  I think we are ready.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in their absolute value",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must exactly counterbalance the sum of the already found cards. If the sum of the found cards is `S`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-S`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards such that their sum can be `-S` using integers within the range `[-x, x]`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the absolute value of the deficit `T = -S`. The maximum absolute value each card can contribute is `x`. Therefore, the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of `|T| / x`, because each card can at most reduce the deficit by `x` (if positive) or increase it by `x` (if negative). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Calculate the total sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - Compute the deficit `T = -S`.\n   - If `T` is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of `|T| / x` using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the list of found cards to compute their sum, which is O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of found cards. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(cards)\ndeficit = -total_sum\n\nif deficit == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n    k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The first line reads two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line reads the list of `n` integers representing the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The deficit `deficit` is then calculated as the negative of this sum.\n- **Zero Deficit Check**: If the deficit is zero, the sum of the found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n- **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimal number of cards required is found by performing ceiling division of the absolute deficit by `x`. This is efficiently done using integer arithmetic: `(abs_deficit + x - 1) // x`.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic and ensures optimal performance with minimal computational overhead.",
