The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of chests (n) and keys (m)\n Then a list of n integers (a_i) for the chests\n Then a list of m integers (b_j) for the keys.\n\n Condition: A key j can open chest i if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Note: \n   - The condition is equivalent to: \n        (a_i is even and b_j is odd) OR (a_i is odd and b_j is even)\n\n We cannot use one key more than once, and one chest only once.\n\n Therefore, we can think of this as a bipartite matching problem where we have two sets:\n   Chests: divided into even_chests and odd_chests (based on parity of a_i)\n   Keys: divided into even_keys and odd_keys (based on parity of b_j)\n\n However, note that the condition for a chest of even number is that we need an odd key.\n Similarly, a chest of odd number requires an even key.\n\n So, we can model:\n   Left side: even_chests and odd_chests (we don't care about the actual numbers, just the counts and which type they are)\n   Right side: even_keys and odd_keys\n\n But note: the matching is between:\n   even_chests can only be matched with odd_keys.\n   odd_chests can only be matched with even_keys.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n Let:\n   E_c = number of even chests\n   O_c = number of odd chests\n\n   E_k = number of even keys\n   O_k = number of odd keys\n\n Then, the maximum matching we can get is limited by:\n\n   For even_chests: they require odd_keys. So the maximum number of even_chests we can open is min(E_c, O_k).\n   Similarly, for odd_chests: they require even_keys. So the maximum number of odd_chests we can open is min(O_c, E_k).\n\n But wait, is that really independent? Actually, the two sets of keys (even and odd) are distinct and we are not sharing keys between the two types.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice. But the above two min conditions are independent because:\n   - The even_chests use odd_keys and odd_chests use even_keys. These two sets of keys are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n   total = min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n But let's validate with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n   So, E_c = 3, O_c = 2.\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n   So, E_k = 3, O_k = 1.\n\n   Then, even_chests (3) can use at most min(3, 1) = 1 odd key.\n          odd_chests (2) can use at most min(2, 3) = 2 even keys.\n\n   Total = 1 + 2 = 3. This matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k=1, E_k=0.\n\n   Then, even_chests: min(5,1)=1; odd_chests: min(0,0)=0. Total=1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0.\n\n   Then, even_chests: min(1,0)=0; odd_chests: min(0,4)=0. Total=0.\n\n So the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n and m.\n   2. Read the next line for chests, convert each to integer and then check if it's even or odd.\n   3. Similarly for keys.\n\n However, note: we don't need the actual values beyond their parity.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest_count = 0\n   for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest_count += 1\n\n   odd_chest_count = n - even_chest_count\n\n   even_key_count = 0\n   odd_key_count = 0\n   for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key_count += 1\n\n   result = min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count)\n\n   print(result)\n\n But wait: is there any other constraint? The problem says one key can be used once and one chest once, but we are counting the available keys per type and chests per type.\n\n Since the keys and chests are independent in terms of which type they are, and the matching is only constrained by the counts of the opposite type, the above formula holds.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to use the same key for multiple chests, and we are not using the same key twice, so we are correctly limiting by the minimum of the required keys and the chests.\n\n Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   even_chest_count = 3, odd_chest_count = 2\n   even_key_count = 3, odd_key_count = 1\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example 2:\n   even_chest_count = 5, odd_chest_count = 0\n   even_key_count = 0, odd_key_count = 1\n   result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   even_chest_count = 1, odd_chest_count = 0\n   even_key_count = 4, odd_key_count = 0\n   result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n However, note that the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so we are doing two passes (one for chests and one for keys) which is O(n+m) and efficient.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and the number of even and odd keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys (since each even chest needs an odd key).\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys (since each odd chest needs an even key).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the result as the sum of the two minimum values derived from the counts.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest_count = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest_count += 1\n            \n    odd_chest_count = n - even_chest_count\n    \n    even_key_count = 0\n    odd_key_count = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key_count += 1\n            \n    result = min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers written on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Chests**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (`even_chest_count`) and how many have odd numbers (`odd_chest_count`).\n3. **Counting Keys**: Similarly, the code counts the number of even and odd keys (`even_key_count` and `odd_key_count` respectively).\n4. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by adding the minimum of even chests and odd keys (since each even chest requires an odd key) and the minimum of odd chests and even keys (since each odd chest requires an even key).\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal matching between chests and keys, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
