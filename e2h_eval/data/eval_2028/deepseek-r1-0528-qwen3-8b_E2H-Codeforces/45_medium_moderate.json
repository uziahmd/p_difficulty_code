There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all their games. The key is that the tournament grid must follow the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the rule allows for some flexibility. However, note that the winner must win k games. Therefore, the tournament must have at least k rounds (if we consider the standard bracket), but the structure might be more balanced.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players required for a tournament where the winner plays exactly k games, under the given constraint.\n\n How does the tournament progress?\n In the first game, the winner (player 1) plays one game. Then, to play a second game, he must face someone who has also played at most one game. But note: the other player must have played 0 or 1 game. However, if we want the winner to play k games, then we need to arrange the rest of the tournament so that after each of his k games, the next opponent (if any) is available (i.e., has played either k-1 or k-2 games? Actually, the rule says: the number of games one has played differs by no more than one from the other.\n\n But note: the entire tournament must be arranged such that the winner can keep playing until he has won k games.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the tournament as having two types of brackets: one for players who are \"ahead\" and one for those who are \"behind\", but the problem is symmetric.\n\n Another approach: let's say the winner plays k games. Then, in order for him to play k games, we need to have at least k rounds. However, the structure is not necessarily a perfect binary tree because n might not be a power of two.\n\n We can think of building a tournament tree for the winner:\n\n Round 1: 1 game (the winner's first game) requires 2 players (but one is the winner, so the opponent is one other player).\n Round 2: the winner must face a player who has played 1 game (so that the difference is at most one). This requires that the opponent has won one game (from a mini-tournament of 2 players). So to have an opponent with 1 game, we need 3 players for the opponent's side (the opponent and the two others that played the first game to produce the opponent).\n\n Similarly, for the third game, the opponent must have played either 1 or 2 games. To get an opponent with 2 games, we need to have a subtree that produces a player with 2 wins. That subtree would require 7 players (since to get 2 wins for a player, we need a mini-tournament of 7 players: the winner of a 3-player tournament and then two more players to form a 3-player tournament? Actually, let's define:\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that one player can win k games.\n\n Base case:\n   k = 0: 1 player (no game)\n   k = 1: 2 players (the winner and one opponent)\n\n For k>=2:\n   In the k-th game (which is the last for the winner), the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n   However, to maximize the chance, we use the minimal structure.\n\n Actually, we can consider that the tournament for k games is built by:\n   - The winner must have k-1 wins from previous rounds and then the final game.\n   - The opponent for the k-th game must come from a branch that has been played with k-1 games (or k-2?).\n\n But note the rule: the two players can only play if their numbers of games differ by at most one. So when the winner (who has k-1 wins) is going to play the k-th game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n However, to minimize the total number of players, we would prefer to use the opponent that has k-1 wins (because then the entire tournament is more balanced). But wait, we are trying to compute the maximum k for which a tournament with n players exists.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the maximum k such that the minimal number of players required for k wins is <= n.\n\n Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n Then:\n   F(0) = 1\n   F(1) = 2\n\n For k>=2:\n   The winner must have k-1 wins from the previous rounds. Then, the last game is against an opponent that has either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n However, to maximize the minimal total players, we can consider that the entire tournament (excluding the winner) is built from subtrees.\n\n Actually, the standard way to build a knockout tournament is that the winner must defeat k opponents, and each opponent must have come from a subtree. But the rule complicates it.\n\n Another idea: we can model the tournament as having two halves: one half for players that have played fewer games and one half for those that have played more.\n\n However, note that the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can play. We can use a recursive relation:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimal number of players to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n Then, the tournament for k games must have:\n   - The winner's k-1 previous games: these k-1 wins require a certain number of players (at least F(k-1)) but wait, actually the entire structure is built by merging two subtrees?\n\n Actually, the tournament can be viewed as:\n\n   The winner must face an opponent that has played either k-1 or k-2 games. To minimize the total number of players, we would choose the option that requires the fewest players.\n\n However, we are computing the minimal number of players to achieve k wins. So:\n\n   To have a tournament with k wins, we need:\n     - The winner's k-1 wins: so the winner must have played k-1 games, meaning we need a subtree of size F(k-1) to produce the winner with k-1 wins? Actually, no: the winner is one player, but to get the k-1 wins, we need to have k-1 opponents. Each opponent comes from a subtree.\n\n Alternatively, consider that the entire tournament (for the winner) is built by:\n\n   Round 1: The winner plays one game. There is one opponent (from 1 other player).\n   Round 2: The winner plays again. The opponent must have played 1 game (so that the difference is 0). This opponent must have won one game (so we need a subtree of 2 players for that opponent, but one of them is the opponent and the other is the one the opponent defeated). However, the winner and the opponent of round 2 cannot be the same as the ones in round 1? \n\n Actually, we can break down the minimal structure:\n\n   F(0) = 1 (only the winner)\n   F(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\n   For F(2): \n        The winner must have 1 win (from a previous game). Then, the second game: the opponent must have either 1 win or 0 wins.\n        If the opponent has 1 win, then that opponent must have come from a tournament of F(1)=2 players (one opponent and one more). Then, the entire structure for the second game would be: \n            The winner's first game: [Winner] vs [Player A]\n            Then, the second game: [Winner] vs [Winner of a 2-player tournament (Player A and Player B)].\n            So total players: 1 (Winner) + 1 (Player A) + 2 (for the 2-player tournament) = 4.\n\n        Alternatively, if the opponent has 0 wins, then the second game is against the initial opponent (Player A) again? But wait, the rule says the number of games must differ by at most one. After the first game, the winner has 1, and if we put the same opponent again, the opponent has 0 -> difference is 1, so allowed. Then total players is 3: Winner, Player A, and no one else. But then the second game: the winner beats Player A again. However, the problem states that the tournament is knockout: once you lose you leave. So the same opponent cannot be used twice because after the first game, the opponent lost and left. Therefore, the opponent must be someone else.\n\n        So the second game must be against a different opponent. And that opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent has 0 games, then we just need one more player. Then total players: 3. However, then the structure is:\n            First game: Winner beats Player A.\n            Second game: Winner beats Player B (who hasn't played before).\n            But then the entire tournament has 3 players. However, note that the winner has played two games, so the minimal structure for 2 wins is 3 players? \n\n        But wait, is 3 players allowed? The tournament must be arranged so that the two games are played. The first game: (Winner, A). Then the second game: (Winner, B). This is allowed because the rule: when the winner (with 1 game) plays B (with 0 games) -> difference is 1. So yes.\n\n        However, then why did we think about the opponent having 1 win? Actually, we don't have to use the same opponent again. The minimal structure for 2 wins is 3 players.\n\n        But then, what is F(2)? 3.\n\n        Now, for F(3): \n            The winner must have 3 wins. The third game: the opponent must have either 2 or 1 wins.\n\n            Option 1: Opponent has 2 wins. Then the opponent must come from a subtree of F(2)=3 players. Then total players: 1 (Winner) + 3 (subtree for the opponent) = 4. But wait, the winner must have already played 2 games, so we need to account for the two wins the winner has. Actually, the entire tournament must be built from the root (the final game) backwards.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think of the entire tournament as having the winner and then the opponents from two different branches. Actually, the minimal structure for k wins is:\n\n            F(k) = 2^(k) - 1? But wait, for k=0: 2^0-1=0 -> not 1. k=1: 1 -> not 2. k=2: 3 -> which is 2^2-1=3, but k=3: 7.\n\n            However, note that in a standard single-elimination tournament (without the rule) the minimal number of players for a tournament with k wins for the winner is 2^k - 1 (a complete binary tree). But the rule here allows a more flexible structure.\n\n            In fact, the example above for k=2: we have 3 players. 3 is less than 4 (which is 2^2). So the minimal structure is actually:\n\n            Let F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=?\n\n            For k=3:\n                The winner must have 2 wins. Then the third game: the opponent must have 2 or 1 wins.\n\n                If the opponent has 2 wins, then the opponent must have come from a tournament of F(2)=3 players. Then the total players: the winner (already having 2 wins) plus the 3 players for the opponent's 2 wins -> 1+3 = 4. But wait, the two wins the winner has must be from two opponents, and these two opponents must have been eliminated by the winner. So we have:\n                    First two wins: two opponents (each from a 1-win structure? Actually, no: each of these two opponents must have been produced by a subtree. But note, the two wins the winner has were against two players that had 0 wins (first win) and then the second win: the opponent must have had 1 win (so that the difference is 1). \n\n                Alternatively, we can consider that the entire tournament is built by:\n\n                    Level 0: 1 player (the winner) and 0 wins.\n                    Level 1: the winner plays one game (against a player with 0 wins) -> now the winner has 1 win, and we have 1 additional player (total 2 players so far).\n                    Level 2: the winner plays again (against a player with 0 or 1 win). To minimize the total players, we use a player with 0 wins (then we need one more player) -> total 3 players so far, and the winner has 2 wins.\n\n                    Now for the third win: the winner must play an opponent that has either 1 or 2 wins. We can have an opponent with 1 win: then we need a tournament that produces one player with 1 win. That tournament requires 2 players (the opponent and the one they beat). But wait, the opponent must be distinct from the two we've already used. So we need two more players. Then total players: 3 (previous) + 2 (for the new opponent's 1 win) = 5.\n\n                    Or an opponent with 2 wins: then we need a tournament that produces one player with 2 wins. That requires 3 players (as we saw). But then we have to make sure that these 3 players are distinct from the previous ones. So we need 3 more players. Then total players: 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n                However, note: the two wins the winner has already eliminated two players. The third opponent must be someone who hasn't been eliminated by the winner yet, but we can arrange the entire tournament arbitrarily.\n\n                Actually, the minimal structure for k wins is the minimal number of players such that the tournament can be arranged so that the winner plays k games.\n\n                There is a known recurrence for the maximal k for a given n (in tennis championship problems) which is similar to the following:\n\n                Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n                Then, the tournament can be broken into two parts: the winner and the rest.\n\n                After the first k-1 wins, the winner has played k-1 games. Then, to get the k-th win, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n                But note: the entire tournament must account for all the players. The minimal structure is:\n\n                F(0) = 1\n                F(1) = 2\n                For k>=2:\n                    F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n                Why? Because to have a tournament with k wins, the winner must have a subtree of k-1 wins (F(k-1)) and then the last game is against an opponent that has either k-1 wins (which would require F(k-1) players) or k-2 wins (which requires F(k-2) players). But wait, the opponent is not part of the winner's subtree. Actually, the entire set of players is the winner and the two subtrees (one for the wins the winner has and one for the last opponent). However, the last opponent's wins are independent.\n\n                Alternatively, consider that the entire tournament can be partitioned into three parts:\n                  - The winner (1 player)\n                  - The opponents that the winner directly defeated (k-1 opponents, each from a subtree of 0 wins? Not exactly, because the rule allows for more complex arrangements.\n\n                Actually, let me reexamine:\n\n                We can build the tournament as follows:\n\n                  The winner must have k-1 wins, so we need k-1 direct opponents. Each direct opponent must have been eliminated by the winner, and each of these opponents must have won some games (possibly zero or more, but the rule must hold at the time of the match).\n\n                However, the minimal structure is achieved by having the last opponent (the one that gives the k-th win) come from a subtree that is as small as possible, and then the previous k-1 wins are arranged minimally.\n\n                But note: the entire tournament must be consistent. The rule says that two players can only play if their counts differ by at most one.\n\n                There is a known sequence for this problem: the answer for n players is the maximum k such that F(k) <= n, where F(k) is defined by:\n\n                  F(0) = 1\n                  F(1) = 1   [but wait, we see F(1)=2, so maybe we shift]\n\n                Actually, let me look at the sample outputs:\n\n                  Input: 2 -> Output: 1\n                  Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n                  Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n\n                Wait, for n=4: the answer is 2. That means with 4 players, the winner can play at most 2 games.\n\n                How? \n                  Example: two semifinals (A vs B and C vs D) and then the final (winner of AB vs winner of CD). Then the winner plays 2 games.\n\n                But for n=3, the winner plays 2 games: \n                  First, the winner plays one opponent (so one game). Then, the winner must play the remaining player. But the remaining player hasn't played any game, so the difference is 1 (allowed). So the winner plays 2 games.\n\n                Now, what is the minimal structure for k wins?\n\n                We can define:\n                  Let a_k be the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n                Then, the tournament for k wins must include:\n                  - The winner (1 player)\n                  - The opponents that the winner defeats in each of the k games, and the players that feed into those opponents.\n\n                However, note that the rule allows the opponent for the k-th game to have either k-1 or k-2 wins. Therefore, the minimal structure is:\n\n                  a_0 = 1   (the winner alone, no game)\n                  a_1 = 2   (the winner and one opponent)\n\n                  For k>=2, the k-th win requires that the opponent for the k-th game has either k-1 or k-2 wins. The minimal way is to use an opponent that has k-2 wins (if k>=2). Why? Because then the entire structure for that opponent is a_{k-2}. Then, the entire tournament for k wins is:\n\n                  a_k = 1 + a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}\n\n                Why 1 + a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}? \n                  - The 1 is the winner.\n                  - a_{k-1}: the winner's first k-1 wins must have been achieved by defeating k-1 opponents, and each of these opponents must have come from a tournament that gives them a certain number of wins. But note: the entire structure for the winner's k-1 wins is a_{k-1} (which includes the winner and the k-1 wins). However, wait, the winner is already counted. Actually, we are building the entire tournament from scratch.\n\n                Alternatively, we can think of the tournament as:\n\n                  The final game (k-th game) is between the winner (who has k-1 wins) and an opponent (who has either k-1 or k-2 wins). The minimal structure is when the opponent has k-2 wins, so we need a_{k-2} players for that opponent. Then, the winner must have a structure that gives him k-1 wins (which requires a_{k-1} players, including the winner). But note: the two subtrees (the winner's part and the opponent's part) are disjoint. So the total minimal players is a_{k-1} (for the winner and his k-1 wins) and a_{k-2} (for the opponent's k-2 wins) and then we must account for the fact that the winner is already included in a_{k-1}. Actually, we should not double count.\n\n                Let me try to define without double counting:\n\n                  The entire tournament has two parts: the part that leads to the winner's k-1 wins (which is a_{k-1}) and the part that leads to the opponent's k-2 wins (which is a_{k-2}), and these two parts are separate. But then the winner is in the first part and the opponent is in the second part, so the total is a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} - 1? (since the winner is counted in both). \n\n                However, the winner is the one who is common. So:\n\n                  a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}\n\n                But wait, for k=2: \n                  a_2 = a_1 + a_0 = 2 + 1 = 3 -> matches.\n\n                Then for k=3: \n                  a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n                Then for k=4: \n                  a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\n                Now, check with the examples:\n\n                n=2: maximum k such that a_k <= 2 -> k=1 (since a_1=2, a_2=3>2) -> output 1. Correct.\n\n                n=3: k=2 (a_2=3<=3) -> output 2. Correct.\n\n                n=4: k=2 (a_3=5>4) -> so maximum k=2. Correct.\n\n                n=10: \n                  a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=3, a_3=5, a_4=8, a_5=13 -> so maximum k such that a_k<=10 is 4 (since a_4=8<=10, a_5=13>10). Then output 4. Matches the sample.\n\n                However, wait: the sample input 10 gives output 4.\n\n                Therefore, the recurrence is:\n                  a_0 = 1\n                  a_1 = 2\n                  a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}   for k>=2.\n\n                But note: the problem asks for the maximum k (number of games) such that the minimal number of players required (a_k) is <= n.\n\n                However, wait: is the minimal number of players for k wins really a_k? \n\n                Let me explain: \n                  a_0 = 1: 0 wins, so the winner doesn't play any game -> requires 1 player.\n                  a_1 = 2: 1 win -> requires 2 players (the winner and one opponent).\n                  a_2 = 3: 2 wins -> requires 3 players (as explained earlier).\n                  a_3 = 5: 3 wins -> requires 5 players.\n\n                But how is the 5 players arranged for 3 wins?\n\n                We want the winner to play 3 games. The minimal structure is:\n\n                  Game 1: Winner (W) vs A -> W wins. Now W has 1 win, A is out.\n                  Then, to get the second win, W must play an opponent that has either 1 or 0 wins. To minimize the total players, we use a player that hasn't played (0 wins). Let that be B. \n                  Game 2: W vs B -> W wins. Now W has 2 wins, B is out.\n                  Then, to get the third win, W must play an opponent that has either 2 or 1 wins. To minimize, we use an opponent with 1 win. How do we get an opponent with 1 win? We need two players (say C and D) to have a game: C vs D, and let C win. Then the opponent for W is C (with 1 win). \n                  Then Game 3: W vs C -> W wins.\n\n                Total players: W, A, B, C, D -> 5.\n\n                This matches.\n\n                However, note that the recurrence a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} is the same as the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted.\n\n                Standard Fibonacci: \n                  fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8, ...\n\n                Our sequence:\n                  k: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...\n                  a_k: 1,2,3,5,8,13,...\n\n                So a_k = fib(k+2) [if we define fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1]? \n                  k=0: fib(2)=1 -> matches.\n                  k=1: fib(3)=2 -> matches.\n                  k=2: fib(4)=3 -> matches.\n                  k=3: fib(5)=5 -> matches.\n                  k=4: fib(6)=8 -> matches.\n\n                Therefore, a_k = fib(k+2)\n\n                Then the problem reduces to: find the maximum k such that fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n                However, note: the minimal number of players required for k wins is fib(k+2). Then the maximum k for which fib(k+2) <= n is the answer.\n\n                But wait: what if we have more than fib(k+2) players? Then we can still have k wins, but the question is: what is the maximum k? So we are to find the maximum k for which fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n                Since n can be as large as 10^18, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers up to about 10^18. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially (about 1.6^k). So the maximum k is around 90 (since fib(90) is about 2.88e18, which is greater than 10^18; so we need to go up to about 89 or 90).\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  1. Read n.\n                  2. Generate Fibonacci numbers (starting from 1,2,...) until we exceed n, but we need the index k such that fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n                Alternatively, we can generate the Fibonacci sequence until we exceed n and then the answer is the index (minus 2) of the last Fibonacci number that is <= n.\n\n                However, note: our a_k = fib(k+2). We want the maximum k such that fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n                Example: n=10.\n\n                  fib(2)=1 -> k=0 -> valid.\n                  fib(3)=2 -> k=1 -> valid.\n                  fib(4)=3 -> k=2 -> valid.\n                  fib(5)=5 -> k=3 -> valid.\n                  fib(6)=8 -> k=4 -> valid.\n                  fib(7)=13 -> k=5 -> invalid.\n\n                Then the maximum k is 4.\n\n                But note: k is the number of wins (games). So we output 4.\n\n                However, wait: the example input 10 gives output 4.\n\n                But note: our sequence a_k is defined for k wins. The Fibonacci index is k+2.\n\n                Algorithm:\n\n                  Let fib[0] = 0, fib[1] = 1, then fib[2]=1, fib[3]=2, etc.\n\n                  We want the maximum k (nonnegative integer) such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n                But note: k starts at 0. The number of games (wins) is k.\n\n                However, the problem states that the winner must win all their games, so k is the number of games.\n\n                Implementation:\n\n                  We'll generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    fib0 = 0, fib1 = 1\n                    Then fib2 = fib0 + fib1 = 1\n                    fib3 = fib1 + fib2 = 2\n                    fib4 = fib2 + fib3 = 3\n                    fib5 = fib3 + fib4 = 5\n                    ...\n\n                    We are interested in fib[i] for i from 2 upwards (since k+2 >=2 for k>=0).\n\n                    We stop when fib[i] > n.\n\n                    Then, the last i for which fib[i] <= n is i0. Then the maximum k is i0 - 2.\n\n                Example: n=10\n                    i=2: fib2=1 <=10 -> k=0\n                    i=3: fib3=2 <=10 -> k=1\n                    i=4: fib4=3 <=10 -> k=2\n                    i=5: fib5=5 <=10 -> k=3\n                    i=6: fib6=8 <=10 -> k=4\n                    i=7: fib7=13 >10 -> stop.\n\n                    Then the maximum k is 4 (since i0=6, then k = 6-2 =4).\n\n                But wait, the index i is the Fibonacci index (starting from 0). We are generating:\n\n                    i=0: fib0=0\n                    i=1: fib1=1\n                    i=2: fib2=1\n                    i=3: fib3=2\n                    i=4: fib4=3\n                    i=5: fib5=5\n                    i=6: fib6=8\n                    i=7: fib7=13\n\n                Then the condition is: for i>=2, the minimal players for k=i-2 wins is fib[i]. So the maximum k is the largest integer k such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate by k:\n\n                  k=0: fib[2] = 1 <= n -> candidate 0\n                  k=1: fib[3] = 2 <= n -> candidate 1\n                  k=2: fib[4] = 3 <= n -> candidate 2\n                  ...\n\n                But since n can be up to 10^18, we don't want to iterate k from 0 to maybe 100 (which is acceptable because Fibonacci grows fast, so k is at most ~90).\n\n                However, we can use a loop that generates Fibonacci numbers until exceeding n.\n\n                Code:\n\n                  fib = [0, 1]\n                  while True:\n                      next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n                      if next_fib > n:\n                          break\n                      fib.append(next_fib)\n\n                  Then, the last index we have is len(fib)-1. But note: we started with [0,1] so the index of the last element is the length.\n\n                  We need the largest index i (>=2) such that fib[i] <= n.\n\n                  Then k = i - 2.\n\n                But wait, the Fibonacci sequence we generated:\n\n                  fib[0]=0, fib[1]=1, fib[2]=1, fib[3]=2, ... \n\n                Then the condition for k wins is fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n                So we are looking for the maximum k such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n                The index in the list for fib[k+2] is (k+2). \n\n                Then the last index we appended was the last fib[i] <= n. But note: we break when we generate a fib number that is greater than n, so the last fib number we appended is the last one <=n.\n\n                Actually, in the loop, we break when next_fib>n, so the last fib we appended is the one that is <=n, and the next one (next_fib) is >n.\n\n                Then the index of the last fib number we have is len(fib)-1.\n\n                Then the maximum k is: k_max = (len(fib)-1) - 2, provided that fib[k_max+2] <= n.\n\n                But note: the last fib we have is at index = len(fib)-1, and that corresponds to Fibonacci index = len(fib)-1.\n\n                Then k_max = (len(fib)-1) - 2.\n\n                However, let's test with n=10:\n\n                  fib = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]  -> then next_fib=13 which breaks.\n\n                  Then len(fib)=7, so k_max = 7-1-2 = 4. Correct.\n\n                But wait, the list fib has 7 elements: indices 0 to 6. The last element is 8 (index 6). Then k_max = 6 - 2 = 4.\n\n                However, note: we started with two initial elements [0,1] and then appended until we exceeded n. The sequence is the standard Fibonacci.\n\n                But what if n is very small, say n=1?\n\n                  Then: \n                    fib0=0, fib1=1 -> next_fib=1 (fib2=0+1=1) -> then compare with n=1: 1<=1 -> append.\n                    Then next_fib = fib1+fib2 = 1+1=2 -> 2>1 -> break.\n\n                    Then fib = [0,1,1] -> len(fib)=3 -> k_max = 3-1-2 = 0? \n                    But k_max = 3-1-2 = 0 -> correct because with 1 player, the winner doesn't play any game.\n\n                However, the problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry about n=1.\n\n                But the input n>=2.\n\n                However, note: the minimal structure for 0 games is 1 player, but we are given n>=2. So we don't have to handle n=1.\n\n                But wait, the example: n=2 -> k=1.\n\n                With n=2:\n\n                  fib0=0, fib1=1 -> next_fib=1 (<=2) -> append, now fib=[0,1,1]\n                  next_fib = 1+1=2 (<=2) -> append, now fib=[0,1,1,2]\n                  next_fib = 1+2=3 (>2) -> break.\n\n                  Then fib = [0,1,1,2] -> len(fib)=4 -> k_max = 4-1-2 = 1. Correct.\n\n                But wait, the minimal structure for 1 game is 2 players, so we must have at least 2 players. Then the maximum k for n=2 is 1.\n\n                So the code:\n\n                  Read n (integer)\n\n                  fib = [0, 1]\n                  while True:\n                      # Compute next Fibonacci\n                      next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n                      if next_val > n:\n                          break\n                      fib.append(next_val)\n\n                  k = len(fib) - 1 - 2   # because the condition is for fib[k+2] <= n, and the last index is len(fib)-1.\n\n                However, note: the last Fibonacci number we computed (that is <= n) is at index len(fib)-1. But the condition for k wins is that fib[k+2] <= n. We are using the entire list.\n\n                But wait, the list fib contains the Fibonacci numbers from index0 to index (len(fib)-1). The condition for k wins is that the Fibonacci number at index (k+2) is <= n. The maximum k is the maximum integer such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n                We can also do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  while True:\n                      if fib[k+2] <= n:\n                          k += 1\n                      else:\n                          break\n\n                But we don't know k in advance.\n\n                Alternatively, we can traverse the Fibonacci list until we find the last index i (>=2) for which fib[i] <= n. Then k = i-2.\n\n                However, we can also do:\n\n                  i = 0\n                  j = 2\n                  while fib[j] <= n:\n                      j += 1\n\n                  Then the last j for which fib[j] <= n is j-1, so k = (j-1) - 2.\n\n                But we don't store the entire list? Actually, we have stored the entire list.\n\n                Since we are generating the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, we can do:\n\n                  fib = [0,1]\n                  while fib[-1] <= n:   # but we break on next_val>n, and the last one we appended is <=n, so we can use the last index.\n\n                Actually, we break when we are going to append a number that is >n. Then the last index is the last one <=n.\n\n                Then k = (last_index) - 2.\n\n                However, note: the last index is len(fib)-1.\n\n                Therefore:\n\n                  k = (len(fib) - 1) - 2\n\n                But wait: the condition for k wins is fib[k+2] <= n. The last index we have is (len(fib)-1) and that corresponds to k+2 = len(fib)-1, so k = (len(fib)-1) - 2.\n\n                Example: n=10, len(fib)=7 -> k=4.\n\n                However, what if n is very large? We are storing a list of about 90 elements, which is acceptable.\n\n                But note: n can be up to 10^18, and we are only storing about 90 numbers, so it's efficient.\n\n               ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key observation here is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games follows the Fibonacci sequence. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that the winner must play \\( k \\) games, and each subsequent game must adhere to the rule that the number of games played by the two players involved differs by at most one. This constraint leads us to recognize that the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play \\( k \\) games is given by the \\( (k+2) \\)-th Fibonacci number.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest \\( k \\) such that the \\( (k+2) \\)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players \\( n \\). This is because the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, allowing us to efficiently compute the result even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate Fibonacci numbers sequentially until the next number exceeds \\( n \\). The index of the last generated Fibonacci number helps us determine the maximum \\( k \\) as \\( \\text{last\\_index} - 2 \\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time since the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, meaning only around 90 iterations are needed for \\( n = 10^{18} \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    \n    k = len(fib) - 1 - 2\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the input \\( n \\) is 2, the output is directly 1 because the winner can play only one game with two players.\n2. **Fibonacci Generation**: The code initializes the Fibonacci sequence with `[0, 1]` and continues generating subsequent numbers by summing the last two elements until the next number exceeds \\( n \\).\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The maximum number of games \\( k \\) is derived from the length of the generated Fibonacci list. Specifically, \\( k \\) is calculated as `len(fib) - 1 - 2`, which corresponds to the index of the last Fibonacci number minus 2, aligning with the problem's requirement.\n4. **Output Result**: The result \\( k \\) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to solve the problem within feasible computational limits, even for very large values of \\( n \\).",
