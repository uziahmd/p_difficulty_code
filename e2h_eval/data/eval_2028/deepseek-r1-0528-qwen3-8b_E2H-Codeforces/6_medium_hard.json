Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Conditions:\n   Two vouchers i and j (i != j) such that:\n     1. They don't intersect: either ri < lj or rj < li.\n     2. The sum of durations is exactly x: (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x.\n\n We are to find the minimal total cost.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note: duration_i = d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1). Then we need two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n 2. We can group vouchers by their duration. However, note that the condition for disjointness is more complex.\n\n 3. Let's denote:\n        For voucher i: (l_i, r_i, cost_i, duration_i)\n\n 4. We cannot iterate over all pairs (n up to 200000) so we must use a smarter way.\n\n 5. Idea:\n    We are going to consider pairs (d, x-d) for durations. But note: the same duration might appear multiple times.\n\n 6. We can precompute an array `vouchers_by_duration` where for each duration d (from 1 to max_duration, which is up to 200000) we store the list of (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n 7. But then we have to check non-intersection. However, even if two vouchers have durations d and x-d, they still must not overlap.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can think: we need two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] such that (r1-l1+1)+(r2-l2+1)=x, and either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n 9. How to check non-intersection efficiently? We can also consider storing for each duration the minimum and maximum of the intervals? But wait: two intervals of the same duration might be many.\n\n 10. Actually, we need to combine two different groups (unless x is even and we can use two same-duration vouchers). So:\n\n    Case 1: x is even -> we might use two vouchers with duration x/2.\n    Case 2: x is odd -> we need two different durations: d and x-d.\n\n 11. However, we cannot simply take the cheapest two from each group because the non-intersection condition depends on the actual intervals.\n\n 12. Alternate approach:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute an array `min_cost_by_duration` for each duration d that we have, but that alone is not enough because we need to know the intervals.\n\n    Step 2: Instead, we can for each voucher (with duration d) store it in two separate structures:\n\n        - One structure that allows us to query for a voucher with duration d' = x - d that does not intersect with the current voucher.\n\n    But how?\n\n    Observation: Two intervals [a,b] and [c,d] do not intersect if b < c OR d < a.\n\n    So for a fixed voucher i (with interval [l_i, r_i]), we are looking for a voucher j (with duration d') such that:\n        - If we require that r_i < l_j (so the first voucher ends before the second starts) then we require the voucher j to start at least at r_i+1 and has duration d' (so its end will be l_j + d' - 1, but we don't care as long as we have one).\n\n    Similarly, if we require that r_j < l_i, then we require the voucher j to end at most at l_i-1.\n\n    But note: the condition is \"at least one\" so we can also have the second voucher ending before the first starts, or the first ending before the second starts.\n\n    However, we are considering two vouchers and the order is arbitrary? Actually, the condition is symmetric. But when we fix the two, we must check both orders.\n\n    Actually, the condition is: two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] do not intersect if and only if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n    So we have two possibilities.\n\n    We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n        Possibility 1: First voucher ends before second starts (r1 < l2)\n        Possibility 2: Second voucher ends before first starts (r2 < l1)\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily. So we can consider:\n\n        Option A: Use two vouchers (i, j) such that r_i < l_j (so i is entirely before j) and the durations add to x.\n        Option B: Use two vouchers (i, j) such that r_j < l_i (so j is entirely before i) and the durations add to x.\n\n    But note: in Option A, we are fixing i to be the first and j the second. In Option B, we are fixing j to be the first and i the second.\n\n    However, we don't know which one is which. So we can think of combining both by storing for each duration the set of intervals.\n\n    But then how to avoid O(n^2)?\n\n 13. Another idea: \n\n    Let's precompute:\n\n        Let's create an array `by_duration` that maps duration d to a list of (l, r, cost). But we don't want to iterate over all pairs.\n\n    Instead, we can try:\n\n        We are going to consider all pairs (d, x-d) and then within each pair, we want to find two intervals (one of duration d, one of duration x-d) that do not intersect and have minimal total cost.\n\n    But note: the same duration might be used twice if x is even (then d = x/2). Then we are looking for two intervals (possibly the same one twice? no, distinct indices) of duration d that do not intersect.\n\n    However, we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n 14. We can do:\n\n        For each duration d (from 1 to max_d), let d2 = x - d.\n\n        Then, we want to consider:\n\n            Case 1: d2 is valid (i.e., there exists at least one voucher with duration d and one with duration d2)\n\n            Then, we need to consider two scenarios:\n\n                Scenario 1: The first voucher (duration d) ends before the second (duration d2) starts: i.e., r1 < l2.\n\n                Scenario 2: The second voucher (duration d2) ends before the first (duration d) starts: i.e., r2 < l1.\n\n            But note: the two scenarios are symmetric. However, the cost is independent of order.\n\n        So we can break the problem into two subproblems:\n\n            Subproblem 1: For a fixed d, we have a set of intervals of duration d. We also have a set of intervals of duration d2.\n\n            We wish to find the minimal cost for two intervals (one from duration d, one from duration d2) such that the interval of duration d ends strictly before the interval of duration d2 starts.\n\n            Similarly, for the other scenario: the interval of duration d2 ends strictly before the interval of duration d starts.\n\n        But note: the two scenarios are independent, and we can combine them.\n\n 15. How to do Subproblem 1 for fixed d and d2?\n\n        We have two sets: \n            A = { (l1, r1, cost1) for duration d }\n            B = { (l2, r2, cost2) for duration d2 }\n\n        Condition: r1 < l2.\n\n        We want to minimize cost1 + cost2.\n\n        We can try to preprocess set B: sort by l2 (the start of the second interval). Then for each interval in A (with end r1), we need to find in B an interval that starts at least at r1+1 and has minimal cost.\n\n        Similarly, for the other scenario: Condition: r2 < l1.\n\n        Then we can preprocess set A: sort by l1 (which is the start of the first interval) and then for each interval in B (with end r2) we look for an interval in A that starts at least at r2+1 and has minimal cost.\n\n        But note: the two scenarios are separate. However, we must consider that the two vouchers are distinct.\n\n        Also, if d == d2 (i.e., x is even) then we are using two different intervals from the same set. Then the condition for non-intersection becomes: either the first ends before the second starts (r1 < l2) or the second ends before the first starts (r2 < l1). But note: in this case, we are considering two distinct intervals from the same set.\n\n        So we must handle the case d==d2 separately.\n\n 16. Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read input.\n\n        Step 2: Group vouchers by duration. We'll create a dictionary:\n\n            groups = {}\n            for each voucher (l, r, cost):\n                d = r - l + 1\n                append (l, r, cost) to groups[d]\n\n        Step 3: For each duration d from 1 to max_d (max_d <= 200000) and let d2 = x - d.\n\n            Conditions to skip: \n                - d > x: then d2 would be negative, so skip.\n                - d2 < 0: skip.\n                - d2 not in groups: skip.\n\n            Then, we consider two cases: d != d2 and d == d2.\n\n        Step 4: For the case d != d2:\n\n                We have two groups: group1 = groups[d] (for duration d) and group2 = groups[d2] (for duration d2)\n\n                We need to consider two scenarios:\n\n                    Scenario 1: Use an interval from group1 (first) and then an interval from group2 (second) such that the first ends before the second starts.\n\n                    Scenario 2: Use an interval from group2 (first) and then an interval from group1 (second) such that the second ends before the first starts.\n\n                However, note: the condition is symmetric. But the ordering is fixed by the requirement (either the first voucher ends before the second starts, or vice versa). Actually, the condition is that the two intervals do not intersect, which can happen in two ways.\n\n                But note: the two scenarios are independent and we must consider both. However, we can process each scenario independently.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    For Scenario 1: \n                        Sort group1 by r (the end of the first interval). Then for each interval (l1, r1, cost1) in group1, we want to find in group2 an interval (l2, r2, cost2) such that l2 >= r1+1 (i.e., the second interval starts at least after the first ends) and the total cost is minimized.\n\n                    How to do that fast? \n\n                        Preprocess group2: sort by l2 (the start) and then by cost? Actually, we want for a given r1, to consider all intervals in group2 that start >= r1+1, and we want the minimal cost in that part.\n\n                        We can do: \n                            Sort group2 by l2 (and then we can also keep track of minimal cost for a given prefix? Actually, we can create an array for group2: sorted by l2, and then we can create a structure that for a given l_min (r1+1) returns the minimal cost for any interval in group2 with l2 >= l_min.\n\n                        Similarly for Scenario 2.\n\n                But note: we have two different group2s for the two scenarios? Actually, in Scenario 1, the second voucher is from group2 (duration d2) and in Scenario 2, the second voucher is from group1 (duration d) for the other condition? Wait, no:\n\n                    Scenario 1: \n                        First voucher from group1 (duration d) and second from group2 (duration d2): condition is r1 < l2.\n\n                    Scenario 2: \n                        First voucher from group2 (duration d2) and second from group1 (duration d): condition is r2 < l1.\n\n                Actually, we can reframe: \n\n                    We have two groups: A (duration d) and B (duration d2). We wish to find two intervals, one from A and one from B, such that either:\n                        Option 1: (a from A) and (b from B) with a.r < b.l\n                        Option 2: (b from B) and (a from A) with b.r < a.l\n\n                But note: the condition for non-intersection is symmetric, but the ordering of the two intervals is arbitrary. However, the condition is defined without order. So actually, we can combine:\n\n                    Condition 1: a.r < b.l   (this forces a to be before b)\n                    Condition 2: b.r < a.l   (this forces b to be before a)\n\n                These are the two possibilities.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    For Option 1 (a from A, b from B, a.r < b.l):\n\n                        Sort A by r (the end of the interval)\n                        Sort B by l (the start of the interval)\n\n                        Then, for each a in A, we want to find the minimal cost in B for which l >= a.r+1.\n\n                    For Option 2 (b from B, a from A, b.r < a.l):\n\n                        Sort B by r (the end of the interval)\n                        Sort A by l (the start of the interval)\n\n                        Then, for each b in B, we want to find the minimal cost in A for which l >= b.r+1.\n\n                Then, the answer for (d, d2) is the minimum between the two options.\n\n                But note: we are iterating over d and d2, and we must not count the same pair twice. However, since d and d2 are fixed, and we consider two distinct groups, this is okay.\n\n        Step 5: For the case d == d2 (i.e., x is even and d = x/2):\n\n                Then we have one group: group1 = groups[d] (which has at least two elements? Actually, we need two distinct vouchers).\n\n                Now, we need two distinct intervals from group1 (same duration) that do not intersect.\n\n                Condition: either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\n                But note: if we have two intervals from the same group, the condition is:\n\n                    Interval1: [l1, r1] and Interval2: [l2, r2] (both have duration d = r1-l1+1 = r2-l2+1)\n\n                    They do not intersect if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Sort the entire group1 by l (start) and by r (end). Then, we want to find two intervals (i, j) such that either:\n\n                        Option A: r_i < l_j   (then the first interval ends before the second starts) \n                        Option B: r_j < l_i   (then the second interval ends before the first starts)\n\n                But note: the condition is symmetric and we are allowed to choose any two distinct.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Preprocessing: \n                        Sort group1 by l (start) and also by r (end). Then, we can consider:\n\n                    For Option A: \n                        We want to find two intervals (i, j) such that r_i < l_j and minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n                    How? \n\n                        We can sort the intervals by l (which is the start) and then for each interval i, we want to find an interval j (with j != i) such that l_j >= r_i+1, and then we want the minimal cost among those j.\n\n                    But note: we are in the same group, so we have all the intervals.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                        Let's create an array of the intervals (l, r, cost) for duration d.\n\n                        We can sort by r (the end) and then for each interval i, we want to find an interval j (with j having l >= r_i+1) and minimal cost.\n\n                    Similarly, Option B is the same condition (since the condition is symmetric) but we can just use the same method: but wait, the condition is the same: non-intersection. Actually, the two conditions are the same: the two intervals must not overlap. And the two possibilities are complementary.\n\n                    Actually, note: the condition \"they do not intersect\" is equivalent to: either the first ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts. However, we can also think: we want two intervals that are completely separated.\n\n                    But note: the condition \"r_i < l_j\" and \"r_j < l_i\" are the two disjoint cases. However, if we consider two intervals, we can assign one as the first and the other as the second arbitrarily. So we can consider:\n\n                        For each interval i, we want to find an interval j (distinct) such that either r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n                    But note: the two conditions are independent. However, we can break it down:\n\n                        Condition 1: j is completely after i (r_i < l_j)\n                        Condition 2: j is completely before i (r_j < l_i)\n\n                    And these two conditions are mutually exclusive (unless the intervals are adjacent, but then they don't overlap). Actually, if two intervals are adjacent (r_i = l_j - 1) then they don't overlap and both conditions are not satisfied? Actually, the condition is \"at least one\" and the two conditions are:\n\n                        Condition1: r_i < l_j -> then the gap is at least 1 day (if r_i+1 <= l_j, then they are disjoint)\n\n                        Condition2: r_j < l_i -> same.\n\n                    But note: we can also have the two intervals in any order. However, when we fix the two intervals, we can assign the one that ends first as the first? Actually, we don't need to assign order. We can consider:\n\n                        We want two intervals (i and j) such that either the first ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts.\n\n                    This is the same as: the two intervals do not share any day.\n\n                    However, the two conditions are:\n\n                        Condition1: [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j]: if r_i < l_j, then they are disjoint.\n                        Condition2: if r_j < l_i, then they are disjoint.\n\n                    So we can combine by: we want two intervals that are disjoint.\n\n                    How to compute the minimal cost for two disjoint intervals of the same duration d?\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Sort the intervals by l (start) and then by r (end). Then, for each interval i, we want to find an interval j (j != i) that is either entirely after or entirely before.\n\n                    But note: we can split the problem:\n\n                        Part 1: Consider two intervals that are entirely after each other: then we can sort by l and then for each interval, we want to find the next interval that starts after r_i. Then, we can do:\n\n                            Sort by l (start) and then for each interval, we can use binary search to find the next interval that starts at least at r_i+1.\n\n                        But we want to minimize the cost. So we can precompute:\n\n                            Let arr = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])   # by start\n                            Then, we can also create an array of the minimal cost for intervals from index i onwards? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But note: n can be up to 200000.\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                        We'll do two things:\n\n                            Option A: Each interval i: we look for an interval j (with j having l >= r_i+1) and take the minimal cost among those.\n\n                            Option B: Each interval i: we look for an interval j (with j having r < l_i) and take the minimal cost among those.\n\n                    But note: Option A and Option B are two different ways to get disjoint intervals.\n\n                    However, we must be cautious: the same interval j might be used for multiple i.\n\n                    Steps for Option A (entirely after):\n\n                        Sort the list of intervals by l (start). Then, we can iterate from right to left, and for each interval i, we want to know the minimal cost of an interval that starts at least at r_i+1.\n\n                        We can precompute an array min_cost_from_right, where for each index i (in the sorted-by-l array) we store the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\n                        Then, for an interval i (with r_i), we can binary search the first index j0 in the sorted-by-l array such that l[j0] >= r_i+1. Then the minimal cost in the subarray [j0, end] is stored.\n\n                    Similarly, for Option B (entirely before):\n\n                        Sort the list of intervals by r (end). Then, for each interval i (with l_i), we want to find an interval j (with r_j < l_i) and minimal cost.\n\n                        Then, we can precompute an array min_cost_from_left, where for each index i (in the sorted-by-r array) we store the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\n                        Then, for an interval i (with l_i), we binary search the last index j0 in the sorted-by-r array such that r[j0] < l_i, and then take the minimal cost from 0 to j0.\n\n                    Then, the candidate for the same duration d is the minimum of:\n\n                        candidate1 = min_{for each i} (cost_i + min_cost_after[i])   [where min_cost_after[i] is the minimal cost of an interval that starts after the end of i]\n                        candidate2 = min_{for each i} (cost_i + min_cost_before[i])   [where min_cost_before[i] is the minimal cost of an interval that ends before the start of i]\n\n                    However, note: the two options are independent, and we are allowed to use two distinct intervals. But we must ensure that the two intervals are distinct.\n\n                    But in Option A, we are considering intervals that are entirely after, and in Option B, entirely before.\n\n                    However, there is a catch: an interval might be used in both? But no, because we are pairing each interval i with a different interval j.\n\n                    But note: we are not forced to use the same j for all i. We are just looking for the minimal total cost.\n\n                    However, we must avoid using the same interval twice. Since we are storing the entire set and we are considering distinct intervals, we are safe.\n\n                    But note: our preprocessing for Option A and Option B does not remove the possibility that the minimal cost interval j is the same as i? \n\n                    Actually, we are grouping by the entire set. We must ensure that the interval j is distinct from i.\n\n                    How to handle that?\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        For Option A: When we are at interval i (with value (l_i, r_i, cost_i)), we are looking for j such that l_j >= r_i+1. Since the interval i has l_i and r_i, and the condition l_j>=r_i+1 is stronger than the condition that j is not i? Not necessarily: because two intervals could have the same start and end? No, the intervals are defined by (l, r, cost). They can have the same (l, r) but different cost. \n\n                    But note: the problem says distinct indices, not distinct intervals. So even if two vouchers have the same (l, r, cost) but are different, they are distinct.\n\n                    However, the condition l_j >= r_i+1 ensures that j is a different interval (because if j were i, then l_i >= r_i+1, which implies that the interval i starts at least at r_i+1, meaning the interval i has length at least (r_i+1 - l_i + 1) = (r_i - l_i + 2) which is greater than the duration d (which is r_i-l_i+1). So if j is i, then we require d+1 <= d, which is false. Therefore, j cannot be i.\n\n                    Similarly, for Option B: condition r_j < l_i, then for j=i: we require r_i < l_i, which is impossible because l_i <= r_i. So j cannot be i.\n\n                    Therefore, we are safe.\n\n 17. Implementation:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            ans = a very large number (like 10**18)\n\n            Step 1: Group by duration.\n\n            Step 2: Consider all d from 1 to max_d (we can go from 1 to 200000) such that d <= x and d2 = x-d is in the groups (or if d==d2, then we require at least two vouchers in groups[d]).\n\n            Step 3: For d != d2:\n\n                    Let A = groups[d], B = groups[d2]\n\n                    Precompute for Option 1 (A first then B):\n\n                        Sort A by r (the end) and also create a list of (r, cost) for A.\n\n                        Then, we want to build a structure for B: we want to quickly query the minimal cost for an interval in B that has l >= some value.\n\n                        Steps for Option 1:\n\n                            Sort B by l (the start) and then also extract the minimal cost from the point of l onwards.\n\n                            Specifically, we can do:\n\n                                sorted_B_by_l = sorted(B, key=lambda x: x[0])   # each element is (l, r, cost)\n                                Then, we can create an array for B: \n                                    starts = [x[0] for x in sorted_B_by_l]\n                                    costs_B = [x[2] for x in sorted_B_by_l]\n\n                                Then, we can do a suffix minimum array for costs_B: \n                                    suffix_min[i] = minimum of costs_B from index i to the end.\n\n                            Then, for each interval a in A (each a = (l_a, r_a, cost_a)):\n\n                                We need to find the smallest index j in starts such that starts[j] >= r_a+1.\n\n                                Then, if found, candidate = cost_a + suffix_min[j]\n\n                                Update ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\n                    Similarly, for Option 2 (B first then A):\n\n                        Sort B by r (the end) and create a structure for A: we want to query the minimal cost in A for an interval that has l >= (r_b+1) for each b in B.\n\n                        Steps:\n\n                            Sort A by l (the start) and then build a prefix minimum array for A (for the entire A, but we want to query by l >= some value).\n\n                            Actually, we can do:\n\n                                sorted_A_by_l = sorted(A, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                                starts_A = [x[0] for x in sorted_A_by_l]\n                                costs_A = [x[2] for x in sorted_A_by_l]\n                                Then, we can do a suffix minimum for costs_A? But we want to query: for a given threshold t = r_b+1, we need the minimal cost in A for an interval with start >= t.\n\n                            Alternatively, we can use the same method as above: \n\n                                We'll sort A by l, and then build a suffix_min array for A (by l). But note: we already have sorted_A_by_l by l, so we can do:\n\n                                    Let events = sorted_A_by_l\n                                    Let min_cost_from_index = [0]*len(events)\n                                    min_cost_from_index[-1] = events[-1][2]\n                                    for i in range(len(events)-2, -1, -1):\n                                        min_cost_from_index[i] = min(events[i][2], min_cost_from_index[i+1])\n\n                                    Then, for a given t, we find the first index j in starts_A (which is sorted) such that starts_A[j] >= t, then candidate = events[j][2] + events[i]'s cost? Actually, no: we are iterating over B, and for each B element (l_b, r_b, cost_b) we want to find the minimal cost in A for an interval with l >= r_b+1.\n\n                            Actually, we can do:\n\n                                We have sorted_A_by_l (by l) and we have built an array for the minimal cost from a given starting point (from left to right, we want to know the minimal cost from a given l onwards). But note: the minimal cost from a given l onwards is the minimal cost in A for intervals with l >= some value. \n\n                            Alternatively, we can invert: \n\n                                We want to find the minimal cost in A for intervals with l >= t.\n\n                                We can precompute:\n\n                                    Create an array T for A: (l, cost) and then sort by l, and then the minimal cost for any interval with l >= some value is the minimal cost in the suffix.\n\n                                Steps:\n\n                                    sorted_A_by_l = sorted(A, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                                    starts_A = [x[0] for x in sorted_A_by_l]\n                                    costs_A = [x[2] for x in sorted_A_by_l]\n\n                                    Then, we can do:\n\n                                        suffix_min = [0]*len(starts_A)\n                                        suffix_min[-1] = costs_A[-1]\n                                        for i in range(len(starts_A)-2, -1, -1):\n                                            suffix_min[i] = min(costs_A[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\n                                    Then, for a given t, we find the smallest index j such that starts_A[j] >= t, then the minimal cost is suffix_min[j].\n\n                            Then, for each b in B:\n\n                                t = b[1] + 1   # because b.r is the end, then the next day is b.r+1\n                                j = bisect.bisect_left(starts_A, t)\n                                if j < len(starts_A):\n                                    candidate = b[2] + suffix_min[j]   # but note: suffix_min[j] is the minimal cost in A for intervals with l>=starts_A[j] (which is >= t) and including the current one?\n                                    Actually, we have built suffix_min from j to the end, so yes.\n\n                    Then, update ans = min(ans, candidate) for Option 2.\n\n            Step 4: For d == d2:\n\n                    Then, we have group = groups[d] (which must have at least two elements)\n\n                    Then, we do two parts: Option A (after) and Option B (before)\n\n                    Option A: For each interval i in group, we want to find an interval j (distinct) such that j starts at least at r_i+1.\n\n                    Steps:\n\n                        Sort the group by l (start) and build a suffix_min array for the costs (by l).\n\n                        Then, for each interval i (with (l_i, r_i, cost_i)):\n\n                            t = r_i + 1\n                            j = bisect.bisect_left(starts_sorted, t)   # starts_sorted is the list of starts (sorted by l) of the entire group.\n\n                            if j < len(starts_sorted):\n                                candidate = cost_i + suffix_min[j]   # suffix_min[j] is the minimal cost from index j to the end (in the sorted-by-l array)\n\n                    Option B: For each interval i in group, we want to find an interval j (distinct) such that j ends before l_i.\n\n                        Steps:\n\n                            Sort the group by r (end) and build a prefix_min array for the costs (by r).\n\n                            Then, for each interval i (with (l_i, r_i, cost_i)):\n\n                                t = l_i   # we want an interval j with r_j < l_i\n\n                                j = bisect.bisect_left(ends_sorted, t, 0, hi=len(ends_sorted), lo=0, key=lambda x: x[1])? \n\n                            Actually, we have sorted the group by r (the end). Then we want to find the last index j such that r_j < l_i.\n\n                            Then, if j0 = the last index with r_j < l_i, then the minimal cost in the prefix [0, j0] is stored.\n\n                    Then, update ans = min(ans, candidate) for both Option A and Option B.\n\n            Step 5: If we found no candidate, output -1.\n\n 18. However, note: the above for d != d2 uses two separate queries (two separate groups) and for d == d2 uses the same group.\n\n 19. But note: the two scenarios (Option 1 and Option 2) for d != d2 are independent and we must consider both.\n\n 20. Let's summarize the code structure:\n\n        import bisect\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        vouchers = []\n        max_day = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            vouchers.append(data)\n\n        # Build groups: key is duration = r-l+1\n        groups = {}\n        for v in vouchers:\n            l, r, cost = v\n            d = r - l + 1\n            if d not in groups:\n                groups[d] = []\n            groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n        # We'll consider durations from 1 to 200000 (but x can be up to 200000, so d from 1 to 200000 is safe)\n        ans = 10**18 * 2   # a big number\n\n        # We'll iterate over all d that are present and also d2 = x-d must be present (or if d==d2, then we require at least two)\n\n        # But note: d must be <= x, and d2 = x-d must be positive and <= max_duration (which is 200000). But our groups only have keys that are present.\n\n        # We can iterate over d in groups.keys() and if d <= x and (x-d) in groups or (d==x-d and len(groups[d])>=2):\n\n        # However, we must avoid processing d and then again d2 if d != d2, but note: we are iterating d and then d2=x-d. We can iterate d from 1 to x//2 (inclusive) and then consider both d and x-d.\n\n        # But wait, what if x is odd? Then we consider d and x-d, and then x-d is different from d.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to x, but then we might process the same pair twice (once as d and once as x-d). \n\n        # To avoid double counting, we can do:\n\n        #   Consider d from 1 to x//2 (if x is even, then d from 1 to x//2, and if x is odd, then d from 1 to (x-1)//2) and then also consider the case d = x-d (only when x is even) separately.\n\n        # But note: we are grouping by d, and we have two groups: d and x-d. We want to consider both (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) are the same pair? Actually, no: because d and x-d are fixed.\n\n        # Actually, we are iterating d, and then we check if d2 = x-d is in groups. Then we process the pair (d, x-d).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their duration and then checking for valid pairs of durations that sum to `x` while ensuring the intervals do not overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., the number of days they cover). This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d` in the groups. If such a `d2` exists, we then look for pairs of vouchers from `d` and `d2` that do not overlap.\n3. **Non-Overlap Conditions**: Two vouchers do not overlap if one ends before the other starts. We handle two scenarios:\n   - **Scenario 1**: All vouchers from duration `d` end before any voucher from duration `d2` starts.\n   - **Scenario 2**: All vouchers from duration `d2` end before any voucher from duration `d` starts.\n4. **Efficient Lookup**: For each scenario, we sort the vouchers by their start or end times and use binary search to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that meets the non-overlap condition.\n5. **Same Duration Handling**: If `x` is even, we also consider pairs of vouchers with the same duration `d = x/2`, ensuring they do not overlap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for v in vouchers:\n        l, r, cost = v\n        d = r -

start day + 1) into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of vouchers.\n3. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if `d2 = x - d` exists. If `d` equals `d2`, we ensure there are at least two vouchers of that duration.\n4. **Non-Overlap Handling**: For valid pairs of durations, we sort the vouchers by their start or end times and use binary search to find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal total cost of valid pairs is tracked and printed. If no valid pair is found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
