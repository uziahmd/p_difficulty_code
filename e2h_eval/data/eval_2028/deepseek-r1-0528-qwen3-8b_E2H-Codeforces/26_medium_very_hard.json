Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: \n   x + y > z, and similarly the other two conditions (but note: since x<=y<=z, the strictest condition is x+y>z).\n\n However, note the constraints: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]  (since A<=B<=C<=D)\n\n But note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n Therefore, we have:\n   x from [A, B]\n   y from [B, C]\n   z from [C, D]\n\n And the triangle condition: x+y>z.\n\n We cannot iterate over all x, y, z because the ranges can be up to 500000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's fix x and y. Then we require z < x+y and also z >= C and z <= D.\n\n So for fixed x,y, the number of z is: max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1) but note: we require z>=C and z<=min(x+y-1, D). However, if x+y-1 < C then there is no z.\n\n But note: we must also consider that y is at least B and at most C, and x is at least A and at most B.\n\n How to count without iterating over each x and y?\n\n We can think:\n\n Total triangles without condition: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n But with condition x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can count the pairs (x,y) and then for each (x,y) count the z's that are in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n But the range of x+y is from A+B to B+C, which is about 1e6? Actually, A,B,C,D up to 500000, so x+y from 2 to 1000000.\n\n We can try to iterate over the sum s = x+y, and then for each s from min_sum to max_sum, count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y = s and then the number of z is max(0, min(s-1, D) - C + 1) but wait: actually the condition is z < s, so z from [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\n However, note: the problem requires the sides to be in the intervals. Also, x is bounded by [A,B] and y by [B,C]. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the range of s: s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\n 2. For each s from s_min to s_max, we need to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that:\n        A <= x <= B\n        B <= y <= C\n        x+y = s\n\n    Then, for each s, the valid z's are from C to min(D, s-1) (if s-1 >= C, otherwise 0). The count of z for this s is: \n        z_count = max(0, min(s-1, D) - C + 1)\n\n    Then the total for this s is: (number of pairs for s) * z_count.\n\n 3. Sum over s.\n\n But note: the problem also requires that the sides must satisfy A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and C<=z<=D. However, we are iterating by s and then counting the pairs (x,y) that form s, and then the z's that are less than s and in [C, D].\n\n However, there is a catch: the condition on y is that y>=B and <=C, and x>=A and <=B. \n\n How to count the pairs (x,y) for a fixed s?\n\n   x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]? Actually, we have:\n        x in [A, B] and y = s-x in [B, C].\n\n   So:\n        x >= max(A, s-C)   [because y=s-x<=C => x>=s-C, and also x>=A]\n        x <= min(B, s-B)   [because y=s-x>=B => x<=s-B, and also x<=B]\n\n   But note: if s-C < A then lower bound is A; if s-B > B then upper bound is B.\n\n   Conditions for existence of x: \n        L = max(A, s-C)\n        R = min(B, s-B)\n\n   Then the number of x is: max(0, R - L + 1) if L<=R, else 0.\n\n However, note: we must also ensure that y=s-x is between [B, C]. The above conditions on x are derived from that.\n\n Example: first example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\n   s_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+3 = 5.\n\n   s=3: \n        L = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1, R = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> one pair (1,2)\n        Then z must be in [3, min(4, 3-1)] = [3,2] -> no z? So 0.\n\n   s=4:\n        L = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1, R = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2.\n        Pairs: x=1 -> y=3; x=2 -> y=2. But wait, y=2 is not allowed because y must be at least B=2, but note: our y condition is [B, C] i.e., [2,3]. \n        However, the pair (2,2): y=2 is allowed. So two pairs.\n        Then z must be in [3, min(4, 3)] = [3,3] -> one z (3).\n        So for s=4: 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n   s=5:\n        L = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, R = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2 -> one pair (2,3)\n        Then z in [3, min(4,4)] = [3,4] -> two z's (3,4)\n        So for s=5: 1*2 = 2.\n\n   Total = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. This matches the example.\n\n 4. Implementation:\n\n   We can precompute the pairs for each s from s_min to s_max, but note: s_min and s_max can be as large as 1000000, and we are only iterating from s_min to s_max (which is about 10^6) and for each s we do constant time. That is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the constraints say A,B,C,D up to 500000, so s_min = A+B (at least 2) and s_max = B+C (at most 1000000). The range of s is about 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s from s_min to s_max:\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)   # because y = s-x >= B  => x <= s-B, and x<=B\n\n        But note: we also require y<=C, which gives x>=s-C. And x>=A.\n\n        However, there is another constraint: y>=B and y<=C. We have already considered x<=s-B and x>=s-C.\n\n        Now, we must check that L <= R. Otherwise, skip.\n\n        Then the number of pairs for s is: n_pairs = max(0, R - L + 1)\n\n        Then, the z's: we require z in [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\n        Let low_z = C\n        Let high_z = min(D, s-1)\n\n        If low_z <= high_z:\n            n_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n        Else:\n            n_z = 0\n\n        Then, total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   Print total.\n\n But wait: what if s-1 < C? Then n_z=0, so we don't add anything for that s.\n\n Let me test with the second example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\n   A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n   s_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+2 = 4.\n\n   s=3:\n        L = max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n        R = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> one pair (1,2)\n        Then z: [2, min(5,2)] = [2,2] -> one z (2)\n        So 1*1 = 1.\n\n   s=4:\n        L = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n        R = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> one pair (2,2)\n        Then z: [2, min(5,3)] = [2,3] -> two z's (2,3)\n        So 1*2 = 2.\n\n   Total = 1+2 = 3. Matches.\n\n However, wait: the example says output is 3.\n\n But note: the example input is \"1 2 2 5\", and the example output is 3.\n\n Another example: third example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\n   A=B=C=D=500000.\n\n   s_min = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n   s_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000.\n\n   s=1000000:\n        L = max(500000, 1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n        R = min(500000, 1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000 -> one pair (500000,500000)\n        Then z: [500000, min(500000,999999)] = [500000,500000] -> one z (500000)\n        So 1*1=1.\n\n   Output 1.\n\n However, the example output is 1.\n\n But wait: what if the triangle condition is not satisfied? In this case, 500000+500000>500000 -> 1000000>500000, so yes.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)   # Note: because y = s-x must be at least B, so x <= s-B, and x<=B.\n\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n\n        # Count the z's: must be at least C, at most D, and strictly less than s (so <= s-1)\n        low_z = C\n        high_z = min(D, s-1)\n\n        if high_z < C:\n            n_z = 0\n        else:\n            n_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the condition for y is [B, C] and for x is [A, B]. Also, note that when we set R = min(B, s-B), we are using s-B. But let's verify the derivation:\n\n   From y = s - x >= B  => x <= s - B.\n   And x <= B (from the given range).\n\n   Similarly, from y = s - x <= C => x >= s - C.\n\n   And x >= A.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n But wait: the example \"1 2 3 4\" worked, and the others too.\n\n However, note: the range of s is from s_min to s_max, which is about (B+C - (A+B)) = C - A, which can be up to 500000 (if A=1, C=500000). But note: s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C, and the difference is (B+C) - (A+B) = C-A, which is at most 500000. But wait, if A=1 and C=500000, then s_min = 1+B, s_max = B+500000, so the range is from 1+B to B+500000, which has length 500000. \n\n However, if B is large, say 500000, then s_min = 500001, s_max = 1000000, so the range is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: if A, B, C, D are as large as 500000, then s_min = A+B (minimum 1+1=2, maximum 500000+500000=1000000) and s_max = B+C (minimum 1+1=2, maximum 500000+500000=1000000). So the loop runs from at least 2 to at most 1000000, which is 10^6 iterations. This is acceptable in Python if we do nothing heavy inside.\n\n But note: worst-case the range is 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we can optimize by not iterating over every s? Maybe we can use mathematical formulas to compute the counts for pairs and for z.\n\n But the above code is O(s_max - s_min) which is about 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n Let me run the example with A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 again with the code:\n\n   s_min = 3, s_max=5.\n\n   s=3: \n        L = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n        R = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> n_pairs=1\n        n_z: high_z = min(4,2)=2, then if 2>=C(3)? no -> n_z=0 -> 0.\n\n   s=4:\n        L = max(1,4-3)=1, R=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> n_pairs=2\n        n_z: high_z = min(4,3)=3, then 3>=3 -> n_z=3-3+1=1 -> 2*1=2.\n\n   s=5:\n        L = max(1,5-3)=2, R=min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2 -> n_pairs=1\n        n_z: high_z = min(4,4)=4, then n_z=4-3+1=2 -> 1*2=2.\n\n   Total=0+2+2=4.\n\n It works.\n\n But wait: in the example \"1 2 2 5\", note that the triangle (1,2,2) is included. In our calculation for s=3, we had one pair (1,2) and then z=2 was included. However, note the condition: the side z must be at least C (which is 2) and at most D (5). So it's correct.\n\n One more corner: when s-1 < C, then n_z=0. Also, if s-1 >= C, then we take min(D, s-1) and subtract C+1.\n\n But note: we must ensure that the triangle condition is exactly x+y>z. Our method for z is to take all z from C to min(D, s-1). This is correct because z must be less than s (since x+y=s and we require x+y>z) and also in [C,D].\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the triangle condition to be checked separately because we are building the triple (x,y,z) with x+y>z by ensuring z < s.\n\n But wait: the triangle condition is x+y>z, and we are counting z from C to min(D, s-1). This is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the sides must be integers and the triangle condition is the only condition. We are not considering the other two conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) because:\n\n   Since x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z implies the other two (because x+z>=x+y>z>=y => x+z>y, and y+z>=x+y>z>=x => y+z>x). \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n But wait: is that always true? \n\n   Let x<=y<=z and x+y>z. Then:\n        x+z >= y+z >= y+y >= x+y (since z>=y) and x+y>z, but note: we need x+z>y. Since z>=y, x+z>=x+y>z, but we need to compare with y: \n          x+z > y  <=> x+z > y.\n          Since x>=1, and z>=y, then x+z >= 1+y, which is >= y+1 > y. So yes, x+z>y is automatically satisfied.\n\n        Similarly, y+z>=x+z>y (since x>=1) so y+z>x.\n\n   Therefore, the condition x+y>z is sufficient.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        # Determine the valid x range for this s.\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)\n\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n\n        # Count the number of z in [C, D] that are < s.\n        if s-1 < C:\n            n_z = 0\n        else:\n            # z must be <= min(D, s-1)\n            high_z = min(D, s-1)\n            n_z = high_z - C + 1\n            # But if high_z < C, then n_z becomes negative? We already checked s-1>=C, so high_z>=C? Not necessarily: if D < C? But the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C, and s-1>=C, then high_z = min(D, s-1) is at least C (because D>=C and s-1>=C). So we can write without the if.\n\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem states A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C, and we have ensured that s-1>=C (otherwise we set n_z=0). But wait, we did:\n\n        if s-1 < C: n_z=0\n        else: n_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        low_z = C\n        high_z = min(D, s-1)\n\n        if high_z < low_z:\n            n_z = 0\n        else:\n            n_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n\n   But note: if s-1 < C, then high_z = min(D, s-1) < C (because s-1 < C and D>=C) so then high_z < C, then n_z=0.\n\n   So we can write without the explicit if for s-1<C:\n\n        low_z = C\n        high_z = min(D, s-1)\n        if high_z < C:\n            n_z = 0\n        else:\n            n_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n   Or even:\n\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\n   Because if min(D, s-1) < C, then min(D,s-1)-C+1 is negative, and we take max(0,...) so it becomes 0.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\n   But note: min(D, s-1) might be less than C, then we get negative and then max(0,...) sets it to 0.\n\n   Let me test: \n        s=3, C=3: min(4,2)=2, then 2-3+1=0 -> n_z=0. Correct.\n        s=4, C=3: min(4,3)=3, then 3-3+1=1 -> n_z=1. Correct.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\n   Then the code becomes:\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   print(total)\n\n But wait: is there a possibility that min(D, s-1) is less than C? Yes, when s-1 < C. Then we get negative and then set to 0.\n\n However, note that s_min = A+B, and A<=B, so s_min>=2A. And C>=B>=A, so if A=1, B=1, C=2, then s_min=2, and for s=2: min(D,1)-C+1. But wait, if s=2, then s-1=1, and C=2, then 1-2+1=0 -> n_z=0, correct.\n\n But note: the condition for x and y for s=2: \n        L = max(A,2-C)=max(1,2-2)=max(1,0)=1\n        R = min(B,2-B)=min(1,2-1)=min(1,1)=1 -> n_pairs=1\n        Then n_z=0, so we add 0.\n\n However, we must check: the triangle condition for (x,y)=(1,1) and z must be at least C=2, so no z exists because z must be <2 (i.e., 1) but z>=2. So correct.\n\n But note: the problem states that the sides must be integers and the triangle condition must hold. Our method is correct.\n\n However, note: the range of s might be very large (up to 10^6) and we are doing a linear scan. But 10^6 is acceptable in Python.\n\n But wait: the constraints say A,B,C,D up to 500000, so s_min = A+B (at least 2, at most 1000000) and s_max = B+C (at most 1000000). The worst-case range is 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, let's test with the worst-case: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\n   s_min = 1+500000 = 500001\n   s_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n\n   Then the loop runs from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the inner operations are O(1) so total time is O(500000) which is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the problem says that A,B,C,D can be as large as 500000, so we must be cautious for performance.\n\n But 10^6 iterations is acceptable in Python.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: what if the range s_min to s_max is empty? For example, if A+B > B+C, then s_min>s_max. But note: A<=B<=C, so A+B <= B+B <= B+C (since C>=B). So s_min = A+B <= B+B <= B+C = s_max. So the range is non-empty.\n\n However, if A+B > B+C, then no triangles? But that would happen if A>B? But the problem states A<=B. So we are safe.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem states A<=B<=C<=D, so we don't need to worry about the order.\n\n Code:\n\n   A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   print(total)\n\n But wait: what if the condition for y is not just from the x equation? \n\n   We have two conditions for y: y>=B and y<=C. We derived x from y=s-x: \n        y>=B => x<=s-B\n        y<=C => x>=s-C\n\n   But note: we also have x in [A, B]. So we are combining both.\n\n   However, there is one more thing: the value of y must be an integer in [B, C]. We are iterating by s, and then counting the x's. This is correct.\n\n But wait: what if s-C is fractional? No, because s, C are integers.\n\n However, let's test with a non-integer? No, the inputs are integers.\n\n But note: the problem says integers.\n\n But wait: the above derivation for L and R is correct because we are using integer arithmetic.\n\n However, let me test with an example where the pairs are not contiguous.\n\n Example: A=1, B=3, C=4, D=10.\n\n   Consider s=5:\n        L = max(1,5-4)=max(1,1)=1\n        R = min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2\n        So x from 1 to 2 -> two pairs: (1,4) and (2,3)\n\n        Then n_z = max(0, min(10,4)-4+1) = max(0,4-4+1)=1.\n\n        So two triangles: (1,4,4) and (2,3,4). \n\n        Check: (1,4,4): 1+4>4 -> 5>4 -> yes. (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> yes.\n\n   But wait: the y must be at least B=3. \n        For (1,4): y=4>=3 -> valid.\n        For (2,3): y=3>=3 -> valid.\n\n   So correct.\n\n However, wait: the condition for y is [B, C] i.e., [3,4]. So y=3 and y=4 are allowed.\n\n But note: in the example, we are counting (1,4) and (2,3). \n\n   What about (3,2)? But note: the problem states x<=y<=z. However, our input condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So the sides are assigned to x,y,z in increasing order? \n\n   Wait, no: the problem says: \n        A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n   So x is from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D]. \n\n   And note: the triangle condition is independent of ordering, but the problem does not require the sides to be sorted. \n\n   However, wait: the problem does not say that the sides must be in increasing order. It says \"non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z such that A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D\".\n\n   This means that the side x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and z is in [C,D]. \n\n   But note: the triangle condition does not require the sides to be sorted. However, in our condition we are assuming that we are fixing x and y and then z, and then checking x+y>z. But what if the triangle condition fails because we didn't sort the sides? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not require the sides to be sorted. But note: the condition for non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify an order for the sides. But wait: the input condition specifies:\n\n        A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D\n\n   This means that the side x is the smallest? Not necessarily: the problem does not say that x<=y<=z. It only says:\n\n        A<=x<=B, and B<=y<=C, and C<=z<=D.\n\n   And since A<=B<=C, we have A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z, so indeed x<=y<=z.\n\n   Why? Because x<=B<=y, and y<=C<=z. So x<=y<=z.\n\n   Therefore, the sides are in increasing order. So the condition for non-degeneracy is only x+y>z.\n\n   So our method is correct.\n\n Final code:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n        n_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n\n   print(total)\n\n But wait: what if s-B is negative? Then R = min(B, s-B) would be negative. Then if L is positive, then L>R and we skip. So that's okay.\n\n   Example: A=1, B=1, C=2, s=1: \n        s_min = 2, so s=1 is not in the range. So no problem.\n\n   But what if s_min is 2 and we start from 2, then for s=2: \n        L = max(1,2-2)=max(1,0)=1\n        R = min(1,2-1)=min(1,1)=1 -> valid.\n\n   So no negative.\n\n   However, if s-B is negative, then we set R to a negative number, and then if L (which is at least A, which is at least 1) is greater than a negative, then we skip. That is correct because if s-B is negative, then x<=s-B is impossible (since x>=A>=1 and s-B negative, so no solution).\n\n   Example: A=1, B=1, C=2, s=1: s_min=2, so s=1 is not considered.\n\n   Another example: A=1, B=1, C=2, s=2: \n        x must be at least max(1,2-2)=1, and at most min(1,2-1)=min(1,1)=1 -> one pair (1,1). Then z: [2, min(D,1)] -> but s=2, so min(D,1) is 1, and 1<2, so n_z=0.\n\n   So the triangle (1,1,?) doesn't exist because no z (since z must be at least 2 and less than 2). Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the sides must be x,y,z with x in [A,B]=[1,1], y in [B,C]=[1,2], z in [C,D]=[2, D]. But wait, the condition is B<=y<=C, and B=1, so y in [1,2]. But note: the problem states \"B<=y<=C\", so y must be at least 1 (which is B) and at most 2 (which is C). \n\n   But wait, the condition for x: x<=B (which is 1) and x>=A (which is 1) so x=1.\n   For y: we have two possibilities: y=1 or y=2.\n\n   But in our s=2, we only considered y=1 (because x=1, then y=1). What about y=2? Then s= x+y=1+2=3.\n\n   So we must consider s=3 as well.\n\n   But wait: s_min= A+B=2, s_max=B+C=1+2=3.\n\n   Then we have two s: 2 and 3.\n\n   For s=3:\n        L = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n        R = min(1,3-1)=min(1,2)=1 -> one pair (1,2)\n        Then n_z = max(0, min(D,2)-2+1) -> if D>=2, then min(D,2)=2, then 2-2+1=1 -> one z (2)\n\n        So total for s=3: 1*1=1.\n\n   Then total=0 (from s=2) + 1 (from s=3) = 1.\n\n   Which is correct: the triangle (1,2,2) is the only one.\n\n   But wait: the condition for the sides: x=1, y=2, z=2. \n        Condition: 1<=1<=1, 1<=2<=2, 2<=2<=D (if D>=2). And 1+2>2 -> 3>2, yes.\n\n   So the code must consider s=3.\n\n   However, note: the condition for y: in the problem, y is in [B,C] = [1,2]. So y=2 is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: in the example above, we did not consider the possibility that y can be 2 and x can be 1, which gives s=3. \n\n   The issue in the example with s=2 was that we considered the pair (1,1) but then no z exists. And the pair (1,2) is considered in s=3.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the sides must be integers. And we are iterating over s from A+B to B+C, which is the entire range of x+y.\n\n But wait: what if the same triangle can be represented by different s? No, because s=x+y.\n\n   Each triangle is uniquely determined by s=x+y.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require distinct triangles, but the representation is by (x,y,z). However, we are counting by s and then by the pairs (x,y) that form s, and then by z. Each triple (x,y,z) is counted once.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the sides to be distinct, so (2,2,2) is allowed.\n\n   Example: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2.\n\n   s_min = 4, s_max=4.\n\n   s=4:\n        L = max(2,4-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can leverage mathematical insights to efficiently compute the answer without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition needed to ensure non-degeneracy is \\(x + y > z\\). The other conditions (\\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\)) are automatically satisfied if \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Range of Sums**: The sum \\(s = x + y\\) must lie between \\(A + B\\) (minimum possible sum) and \\(B + C\\) (maximum possible sum given the constraints on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)).\n\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) in the range \\([A + B, B + C]\\), determine the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\), \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), and \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\). This is done by calculating the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy both \\(x \\geq \\max(A, s - C)\\) and \\(x \\leq \\min(B, s - B)\\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Z Values**: For each valid sum \\(s\\), the number of valid \\(z\\) values is the count of integers \\(z\\) in \\([C, \\min(D, s - 1)]\\), ensuring \\(z < s\\) to satisfy the triangle condition.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm iterates over each possible sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), computes the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and corresponding \\(z\\) values in constant time per iteration, leading to an overall time complexity of \\(O(B + C - A - B)\\), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    total = 0\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        L = max(A, s - C)\n        R = min(B, s - B)\n        if L > R:\n            continue\n        n_pairs = R - L + 1\n        high_z = min(D, s - 1)\n        if high_z < C:\n            n_z = 0\n        else:\n            n_z = high_z - C + 1\n        total += n_pairs * n_z\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: The minimum sum \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) is \\(A + B\\) and the maximum sum \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\) is \\(B + C\\). These bounds define the range of sums \\(s\\) that need to be considered.\n\n3. **Iterating Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) to \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\), the code calculates the valid range of \\(x\\) values \\([L, R]\\) such that \\(x\\) is within \\([A, B]\\) and \\(y = s - x\\) is within \\([B, C]\\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Pairs and Z Values**: For each valid \\(x\\) in \\([L, R]\\), the corresponding \\(y\\) is determined. The number of valid \\(z\\) values is the count of integers from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s - 1)\\). The product of the number of valid pairs and valid \\(z\\) values is added to the total count.\n\n5. **Output**: The total count of non-degenerate triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to manageable mathematical computations, leveraging constraints to avoid unnecessary iterations and checks.",
