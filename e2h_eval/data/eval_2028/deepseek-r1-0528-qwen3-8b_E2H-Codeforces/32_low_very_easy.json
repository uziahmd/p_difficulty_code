    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Idea:\n 1. Sort the array and then consider that the entire array's min is the first element and max is the last in sorted order.\n 2. When we remove an element, the new min would be the smallest element if we don't remove the current min, but if we remove the min then the next smallest becomes the new min.\n 3. Similarly, the new max would be the largest element if we don't remove the current max, but if we remove the max then the next largest becomes the new max.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to remove only one element.\n\n Alternate approach:\n Let the original array be sorted: b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1]\n\n Then the instability without removal is b[n-1] - b[0].\n\n But we are allowed to remove one element. We can consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: Remove an element that is not the current minimum. Then the new min remains b[0] and the new max is either b[n-1] (if we didn't remove the maximum) or if we removed the maximum then the new max is b[n-2].\n However, we can also remove an element that is not the maximum, then the max remains b[n-1] and the min might change only if we remove the minimum? Actually, we have to consider removal of every element and then compute the instability for the resulting array.\n\n But note: the problem size is up to 10^5, so we cannot try removing each element and then compute min and max by scanning (that would be O(n^2)).\n\n Insight:\n\n Consider the sorted array. After removing an element at index i, the new array will have:\n   If i is the first occurrence, then the new min is:\n        If we remove the first element (min), then the new min is b[1] (if there are duplicates, then the next distinct min? Actually, no: we are removing one occurrence. But note: the array may have duplicates.\n\n However, note that we are only concerned with the min and max. We don't care about the entire array.\n\n So the instability after removing the element at index i is:\n   Let left = b[i-1] if i > 0, otherwise there is no left part so we can't use that. But we can precompute:\n\n Actually, we can think of two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an element that is not the global min. Then the min remains the same (b[0]) and the max is the original max unless we removed the global max? But wait, if we remove a non-min element, we might still remove the max. So we have to consider:\n\n Actually, we can break the removal into two parts:\n\n Option A: Remove an element that is not the smallest. Then the min is still b[0]. The max might change only if we remove the largest element. Otherwise, the max remains b[n-1].\n\n Similarly, Option B: Remove an element that is not the largest. Then the max is still b[n-1]. The min might change only if we remove the smallest element.\n\n But we can also remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest, then both min and max remain the same.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal is:\n\n   If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max:\n        instability = b[n-1] - b[0]\n\n   If we remove the min (but not the max) and the array has more than one occurrence of min?\n        Actually, if we remove one occurrence of min, then the new min is the next smallest which is the first element that is >= min (which is b[0] if there are multiple min? Actually, if we remove one min and there are duplicates, then the min remains the same).\n\n Correction: We need to account for duplicates.\n\n Better approach:\n\n Since we are sorting, we can consider:\n\n   Let the sorted array be b.\n\n   Consider removing an element at position i (0-indexed). Then the new min is:\n        If i == 0, then the new min is b[1] (if n>1) OR if there are duplicates of b[0] then even if we remove the first, the next element is still b[0] (if any). So actually:\n\n        The new min is: \n            If we remove an element that is not the first occurrence of the min (i.e., if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one min, the min remains b[0]), then we only get a new min if we remove every occurrence of the min? No, because we remove only one.\n\n        Actually, the new min is the minimum of the remaining elements. Similarly for the max.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: The first step is to sort the given array. This allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating the instability.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: \n   - If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in a single-element array with zero instability.\n   - If all elements are the same, removing any element will still leave all elements the same, resulting in zero instability.\n3. **Calculate Instability for Each Possible Removal**:\n   - For each possible removal (except when the array has fewer than three elements), the instability can be derived from the sorted array by considering the new min and max after removal.\n   - Specifically, if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, the instability remains the same as the original array.\n   - If we remove the smallest element, the new min becomes the next smallest element in the array.\n   - Similarly, if we remove the largest element, the new max becomes the next largest element in the array.\n4. **Find Minimum Instability**: By evaluating all possible removals (considering duplicates and edge cases), we determine the minimum instability achievable by removing exactly one element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            current_min = arr[1]\n            current_max = arr[-1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            current_min = arr[0]\n            current_max = arr[n-2]\n        else:\n            current_min = arr[0]\n            current_max = arr[-1]\n            \n        instability = current_max - current_min\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n            \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily identify the smallest and largest elements, which are critical for determining instability.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: \n   - If the array size is 1, the instability is trivially 0 (though the problem constraints ensure `n >= 2`).\n   - If the array size is 2, removing either element leaves a single-element array with instability 0.\n   - If all elements are the same, removing any element leaves identical elements, so instability remains 0.\n3. **Iterate Through Possible Removals**: For each element in the array, simulate its removal and compute the new instability:\n   - **Removing the First Element**: The new minimum is the next element in the sorted array, while the maximum remains unchanged.\n   - **Removing the Last Element**: The new maximum is the previous element in the sorted array, while the minimum remains unchanged.\n   - **Removing Any Other Element**: Both the minimum and maximum remain unchanged, so the instability stays the same as the original array.\n4. **Track Minimum Instability**: During each iteration, compare the computed instability with the current minimum and update if a smaller value is found. The final result is the smallest instability achievable by removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking a few key scenarios after sorting, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
