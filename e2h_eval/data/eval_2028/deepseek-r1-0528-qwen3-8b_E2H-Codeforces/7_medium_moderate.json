The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (at least one step after the initial) such that:\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: Start with 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k vertices connected to the center. Now total vertices = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 has degree 1, so each is connected to k new vertices. But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) are connected to k new vertices. However, note that the center is already connected and not a leaf anymore. Also, in the next step, the new vertices added will become leaves again.\n\n Actually, the process:\n   Let t be the number of expansion steps (including the first one). Then:\n     Step 0: center (1 vertex)\n     Step 1: add k vertices -> total = 1 + k\n     Step 2: add k*k vertices (because each of the k leaves from step1 adds k) -> total = 1 + k + k^2\n     ...\n     After t steps: total_vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning t>=1 (at least one expansion step beyond the center).\n\n However, wait: the example for k=4: \n   The smallest snowflake (with k=4) has 1 + 4 = 5 vertices? But the example figure might show more.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"The smallest possible snowflake for k = 4\" is shown. And the example input includes 6,13,15, etc.\n\n Let me clarify the construction:\n\n   Initially: one vertex (the center) -> 1 vertex.\n\n   Then, the center is connected to k new vertices. So now we have 1 + k.\n\n   Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (which are the k leaves) is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\n\n   So from each leaf, we add k new vertices. But note: these new vertices are distinct and not overlapping. Therefore, we add k * k = k^2 vertices.\n\n   Then, in the next step, we would take each of the k^2 leaves (from the last step) and connect each to k new ones, adding k^3, etc.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\n   where t is the number of expansion steps (each step being one layer) and t>=1 (at least one expansion step).\n\n   But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we do the expansion step at least once (so t>=1).\n\n   However, note that the example input: \n        Input: 6 -> Output: NO\n        Input: 13 -> Output: YES\n\n   Let's check for n=13:\n\n        We need to find integers k>1 and t>=1 (at least one expansion) such that:\n\n            (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) = 13\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n          t=1: then (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1 = 13 -> k=12 -> valid.\n\n          t=2: then (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2+k+1 = 13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1 ± sqrt(49) )/2 -> k= (-1±7)/2 -> k=3 or k=-4 -> k=3: 3^2+3+1=13 -> valid.\n\n        So n=13 has two representations.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: n must be representable as (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) for some integer k>1 and integer t>=1.\n\n However, note that the expansion steps must be at least one, so t>=1.\n\n But note: the center is always present. The entire structure is symmetric.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We note that the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   (with t>=1)\n\n   This is a geometric series.\n\n   We can also consider: if we let m = t+1 (which is at least 2), then:\n\n        n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   We are to check for any k>1 and m>=2.\n\n   Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate over all k and m.\n\n   Observation:\n\n   There are two obvious cases:\n\n      Case 1: t=1 (only one expansion step) -> n = 1 + k = k+1 -> so k = n-1. Then we require k>1 -> n>2. But note: the expansion step must be done at least once, so t>=1, but we can also have more than one.\n\n      However, note that the problem requires the expansion step to be done at least once, so we must have at least two layers (center and one ring). \n\n      Actually, note: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added... This step should be done at least once.\" meaning the expansion (step) is done at least once. So we have at least two layers: the center and the first ring.\n\n      But wait, the initial step (step1) is the first expansion. Then the next step (step2) is the second expansion. However, the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the leaves) are connected to k new ones. This is the first expansion. Then the next expansion is the second step.\n\n      However, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do the expansion step at least once. So we must have at least one expansion (so t>=1). Therefore, the minimal n is for t=1: n = 1 + k, and k>1 so n>=3.\n\n      But wait, what about k=2? Then n=3.\n\n      However, the example input:\n\n          Input: 1 -> NO\n          Input: 2 -> NO\n          Input: 3 -> NO\n\n      Why is 3 NO?\n\n      Because the expansion step must be done at least once. With k=2, n=3 is:\n\n          Step0: center (1)\n          Step1: add 2 vertices -> total 3.\n\n      But wait, the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n      Here, we did one expansion step (the first one). Then the leaves (the two vertices) are connected to k=2 new vertices? \n\n      The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do it at least once. But note: the example input says 3 is NO.\n\n      Let me re-read: \"This step should be done at least once\". So the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. In the case of n=3, we only did one expansion (the first one) and then we stop? \n\n      However, the problem does not say we must do the expansion until the entire graph is built arbitrarily. It says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n      This implies that the entire construction must include at least one expansion (the first one) and then the subsequent expansion (on the leaves) must be done at least once? Or is the first expansion the one that must be done at least once, and then the description of the next step is just part of the model?\n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\" -> this is the first expansion.\n\n      Then: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n      This means that after the first expansion, we must do the expansion (on the leaves) at least one time. So the minimal snowflake has two expansions:\n\n          Step0: center (1)\n          Step1: add k (so total 1+k)\n          Step2: add k*k (so total 1+k+k^2)\n\n      But wait, the example for k=4: the smallest snowflake (with k=4) has 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 21 vertices? However, the example output says:\n\n          Input: 6 -> NO\n          Input: 13 -> YES\n\n      How can 13 be represented? \n\n        If we do two expansions (t=2): then n = 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k^2+k+1 = 13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=3 (since k must be integer and positive). \n\n        Then the total steps are two: the first expansion (k=3) and then the expansion on the leaves (k=3) again.\n\n      But wait, the problem says the expansion step (the one that adds k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. This expansion step is the same as the first expansion? \n\n      Let me parse the problem statement:\n\n          Rule 1: Initially, the graph has only one vertex.\n          Rule 2: Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\n          Rule 3: Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n      So the entire process:\n\n          Step0: center\n          Step1: center expands to k new vertices (so now the center has degree k, and each new vertex has degree 1) -> this is the first expansion.\n          Then, the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. So we must do the expansion on the leaves (which are the k new vertices) at least once.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have two expansions: the first expansion (by the center) and then at least one expansion by the leaves.\n\n      So the minimal n is for k=2: 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1+2+4=7.\n\n      But wait, the example input:\n\n          Input: 3 -> NO, but according to our minimal n=7, then 3 is too small.\n\n      However, the example input:\n\n          Input: 6 -> NO\n\n      According to the example output, 6 is NO.\n\n      Let me check the example outputs:\n\n          Input: 1 -> NO\n          Input: 2 -> NO\n          Input: 3 -> NO\n          Input: 6 -> NO\n          Input: 13 -> YES\n\n      So 13 is the first YES.\n\n      What about 7? 7 is the minimal for k=2? Then 7 should be YES.\n\n      But wait, the example input does not include 7, but the sample output does not say anything about 7. We must rely on the problem statement.\n\n      Clarification: the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. So we must have at least two layers: the center, the first ring, and the second ring.\n\n      Therefore, the formula is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   with t>=1 (meaning at least two layers: center and one ring, but wait no: the first expansion is the center to the first ring, and then the second expansion is the first ring to the second ring. So the minimal is two expansions? Actually, the first expansion is step1, and then the second expansion is step2. So the minimal t is 2? \n\n      But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. That expansion step is the one that adds k new vertices to each leaf. The first expansion (center to k) is separate and mandatory (with k>1) and then the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once.\n\n      So the minimal construction:\n\n          Layer0: center (1 vertex)\n          Layer1: k vertices (added by the center) -> total = 1+k\n          Then, we must do the expansion step (Rule3) at least once: so we add k*k vertices (because each of the k leaves gets k new ones) -> total = 1+k+k^2.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2, and k>1.\n\n      For k=2: 1+2+4=7.\n\n      Then, the problem says: \"Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with n vertices can exist.\"\n\n      So we must check if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer t>=1 (for the expansion step) such that:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t+1)   ??? \n\n      Wait, let me re-index:\n\n          Step0: center (1 vertex) -> term: k^0 = 1\n          Step1: first expansion (center expands) -> term: k^1\n          Step2: second expansion (leaves from step1 expand) -> term: k^2\n          ...\n          Step t: term: k^t\n\n      But the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) is done at least once. The Rule3 expansion is the second expansion (step2). So the total number of expansions (steps) is at least two? \n\n      Actually, the problem defines:\n\n          Rule2: Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). -> This is the first expansion.\n\n          Rule3: Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. -> This is the second expansion.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal number of expansions is two. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n      Then, we can have more than two expansions? \n\n          Step0: center\n          Step1: first expansion -> k\n          Step2: second expansion -> k^2\n          Step3: third expansion -> k^3\n          ...\n\n      So the general formula is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   for t>=2 (number of expansions, including the first and then at least one more).\n\n      Alternatively, we can think of the expansion steps (the operations) as:\n\n          Operation1 (mandatory): center expands -> adds k\n          Operation2 (mandatory at least once): then we do the expansion on the leaves (which are the k vertices) -> adds k^2\n          Operation3 (optional): then we do the expansion on the leaves (which are the k^2 vertices) -> adds k^3, etc.\n\n      So the total number of expansions (operations) is at least 2 (first and second) and the total layers (including the center) is at least 3.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. The first expansion (Rule2) is not counted as Rule3. Rule3 is the expansion of the leaves.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2, and k>1.\n\n      Then, for example:\n\n          n=7: k=2 -> 1+2+4=7 -> YES.\n\n      But the example input does not have 7, so we must be cautious.\n\n      The provided example input:\n\n          ['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n      Expected output:\n\n          ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\n      Let's check:\n\n          n=1: NO -> correct (minimal n is 7)\n          n=2: NO -> correct\n          n=3: NO -> correct\n          n=6: NO -> correct (is 6 representable? 1+k+k^2=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> no integer k>1. Also, more expansions: 1+k+k^2+k^3=6 -> too big for k>1, because for k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 which is >6, and k=1 is not allowed. So no)\n          n=13: YES -> as above, k=3 (then 1+3+9=13) OR k=12 (then 1+12=13, but wait: with k=12, the first expansion (Rule2) gives 1+12=13, and then we must do the Rule3 expansion at least once? \n\n          But wait: if we use k=12, then the first expansion (Rule2) gives 13 vertices. Now, are there any leaves? The center has 12 edges, so the center is not a leaf. The 12 leaves (each has one edge from the center) so they are leaves. Then we must do the Rule3 expansion: each leaf must be expanded to 12 new vertices. Then we would have 13 + 12*12 = 13+144=157, which is way larger.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. But if we do Rule3, then we must have the center expansion (Rule2) and then Rule3. So the total number of vertices must be at least 1+k+k^2.\n\n          In the representation for n=13, we have two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: two expansions (t=2): n = 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k=3 (as above) -> valid.\n\n            Possibility 2: one expansion (Rule2) and then Rule3 is not done? But the problem says Rule3 must be done at least once. So the second possibility is not valid.\n\n          However, wait: the example input does not specify the number of expansions. The problem says: \"there exists such k>1\", and the construction must satisfy the rules (including Rule3 at least once). \n\n          But note: the construction must be done according to the rules, meaning:\n\n            - Start with one vertex.\n            - Then, the center expands (Rule2) to k new vertices (so n becomes 1+k).\n            - Then, the expansion step (Rule3) is done at least once: so we must then take each of the k leaves and add k new vertices for each, so we add k*k, making n = 1+k+k^2.\n\n          But wait: the problem does not say we must stop after two expansions. It says the entire graph is constructed by these rules. However, the problem does not specify that we must use the same k throughout? Actually, the problem says \"an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules\", and the rule uses k (a fixed integer) for each expansion.\n\n          Therefore, k is fixed. Then, the entire snowflake is built with the same k.\n\n          Now, if we have n=13, and we try k=12:\n\n            Step0: 1\n            Step1: 1+12 = 13.\n\n            Then, we must do Rule3: take each of the 12 leaves and add 12 new vertices to each. Then we get 13 + 12*12 = 157.\n\n            But 157 != 13.\n\n          So how can 13 be valid? \n\n          The example output says YES for 13.\n\n          The key: the expansion steps are not required to be continued indefinitely, but the problem does not say we must stop at the first expansion. However, the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. But note: the expansion step (Rule3) is defined as: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (which in the state after the first expansion are the 12 leaves) is connected by edges to k more new vertices. \n\n          However, if we do Rule3, then we must add 12*12=144 vertices, so the total becomes 157. \n\n          But wait, what if we consider that the construction can stop at the first expansion? \n\n          The problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning the Rule3 expansion must be done at least once. So we cannot stop at the first expansion.\n\n          Then how is 13 valid? \n\n          Another interpretation: perhaps the entire snowflake is built by performing the expansion steps (both Rule2 and Rule3) in an arbitrary order? But the problem describes a fixed order: first Rule2, then Rule3, then Rule3 again, etc.\n\n          Alternatively, note that the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is connected to k new ones. This could be done in multiple rounds, but note that after the first Rule2, the center is no longer a leaf. Then the leaves are the ones from the first Rule2. Then we do Rule3 on them. Then the new leaves (from Rule3) are the ones we just added, and then we can do Rule3 again if we want.\n\n          But the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning Rule3 must be done at least once. So we must do Rule3 at least once (so we have at least two layers: the center and the two rings).\n\n          However, then n=13 must be represented by two layers: center and two rings? \n\n          But 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k=3 (because 1+3+9=13) and k=3>1. So k=3 is valid.\n\n          Alternatively, could we have more layers? \n\n          For example, if we have three layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3. Then 1+k+k^2+k^3=13 -> k^3+k^2+k-12=0. For k=2: 8+4+2-12=2 -> not zero. For k=1: not allowed. So no.\n\n          Therefore, n=13 is valid because we can choose k=3 and stop after two expansions (Rule2 and one Rule3).\n\n      Now, what about n=15?\n\n          Possibility: two layers: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=(-1±sqrt(57))/2 -> not integer.\n          Possibility: three layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0 -> k=2: 8+4+2=14 -> 14+1=15? Actually, the formula is (k^4-1)/(k-1)=15 -> k^4-1=15*(k-1) -> k^4-15k+14=0. For k=2: 16-30+14=0 -> yes. So k=2 and t=3 (three expansions: center, then two Rule3 expansions? Actually, the first expansion (Rule2) and then two Rule3 expansions (because Rule3 must be done at least once, but we did it twice). \n\n          Alternatively, note: the formula for t expansions (including the first and then t-1 Rule3 expansions) is:\n\n                n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n          But wait, the expansion steps: \n            Step0: center (exponent 0)\n            Step1: Rule2: exponent 1 -> total layers=2\n            Step2: Rule3: exponent 2 -> total layers=3\n            Step3: Rule3: exponent 3 -> total layers=4\n\n          Actually, the total number of layers (including the center) is t+1? \n\n          Let me define:\n\n            Let m = number of expansion steps (Rule2 and Rule3 combined) and note that Rule2 is one expansion step and then Rule3 is another expansion step. But the problem says Rule3 must be done at least once, so the total expansion steps (if we count Rule2 as one and Rule3 as one) is at least two.\n\n          However, note the problem does not specify the number of Rule3 expansions, only at least one. So we can have:\n\n            n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1)   for some m>=2 (because we must have at least two expansion steps: the Rule2 and one Rule3, so m=2: then n=1+k+k^2, or m=3: n=1+k+k^2+k^3, etc.)\n\n          But note: the expansion steps are:\n\n            Step1: Rule2 -> adds k^1\n            Step2: Rule3 -> adds k^2\n            Step3: Rule3 -> adds k^3\n\n          So the total number of terms is m (from exponent 0 to m-1) and the number of expansion steps (operations) is m (with the first operation being Rule2 and the rest being Rule3). However, the problem says Rule3 must be done at least once, so m must be at least 2 (because the first operation is Rule2, then at least one Rule3). \n\n          Therefore, m>=2.\n\n          Then, n = (k^m - 1) / (k-1) for some integer k>1 and integer m>=2.\n\n      Now, let's check n=15:\n\n          m=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1 = 15 -> k=14 -> valid (k>1). Then we have two layers: center, first ring (14) and then the Rule3 expansion (but wait, with m=2, the formula includes exponents 0 to 1: so center (k^0) and first ring (k^1). Then the Rule3 expansion (second operation) is included? Actually, the formula (k^m-1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series of m terms: from k^0 to k^(m-1). \n\n          But note: the problem's construction:\n\n            Operation1 (Rule2) adds k^1 (so we have terms: 1, k -> two terms, so m=2 gives two terms: 1 and k, which is the first expansion only).\n\n          Then, the Rule3 expansion (at least once) is not included? \n\n          This leads to confusion.\n\n      Let me re-express the construction:\n\n          Operation1 (Rule2): adds k vertices -> total vertices = 1 + k = (k^2-1)/(k-1) [if we consider m=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1] -> but wait, the geometric series for m=2 is 1+k, which is the result after the first expansion.\n\n          Operation2 (Rule3): adds k^2 vertices -> total vertices = 1 + k + k^2 = (k^3-1)/(k-1) [geometric series for m=3: 1+k+k^2].\n\n          Operation3 (Rule3): adds k^3 vertices -> total vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = (k^4-1)/(k-1).\n\n          Therefore, the number of expansion operations (steps) is:\n\n            Operation1: m=1 (gives 1 term: the center and then one ring? Actually, the center is the base and the first expansion is the first ring)\n\n          But the problem says the expansion step (Rule3) must be done at least once. The first expansion (Rule2) is not Rule3. Therefore, the minimal total expansion operations is 2: one Rule2 and one Rule3.\n\n          Then, the minimal representation is for m=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n          Then, n=15:\n\n            m=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=15 -> k^3-1 = 15*(k-1) -> k^3 - 15k +14 = 0 -> k=2: 8-30+14=-8 -> no; k=14: 14^3 is 2744, too big.\n\n            m=4: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=15 -> k^4-1=15*(k-1) -> k^4-15k+14=0 -> k=2: 16-30+14=0 -> yes.\n\n          So k=2 and m=4: then n = (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15. \n\n          But note: m=4 means we did 4 expansion operations? \n\n          Operation1 (Rule2): adds k^1 = 2\n          Operation2 (Rule3): adds k^2 = 4\n          Operation3 (Rule3): adds k^3 = 8\n          Operation4 (Rule3): adds k^4 = 16? -> wait, no: the geometric series is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.\n\n          Actually, the formula (k^m-1)/(k-1) is the sum of the geometric series with ratio k and m terms (from exponent 0 to m-1). So:\n\n            m=1: 1 -> only center (but we must do at least one Rule2 and one Rule3, so m>=3 actually, because the first two operations: Rule2 (m=1 term) and then Rule3 (m=2 term) and then we require at least one Rule3, so the minimal m is 3?).\n\n          But wait, the problem says:\n\n            Step0: center (1 vertex) -> m=0? \n\n            Then, Rule2: adds k^1 -> total 1+k -> m=1 (if we count the center as the 0-th term and then the first expansion as the first term, then we have two terms: center and first ring).\n\n          Actually, the standard geometric series representation for the snowflake after s expansion steps (each step being an operation) is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{s-1}\n\n          and s is the number of operations (expansions). But the problem requires at least two operations: the Rule2 and one Rule3, so s>=2.\n\n          Then, the minimal s is 2: then n = 1 + k + k^1? No: the operations are:\n\n            Operation1 (Rule2): adds k^1 (so we have 1+k)\n            Operation2 (Rule3): adds k^2 (so we have 1+k+k^2)\n\n          But wait, the geometric series for s=2 operations (two expansion steps) is:\n\n            n = 1 + k^1 + k^2   (because the center is the base, then the first expansion (Rule2) adds k^1, and the second expansion (Rule3) adds k^2)\n\n          However, the standard geometric series for s terms (starting from the center) is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{s-1}\n\n          For s=1: n=1 (only center) -> invalid because Rule2 must be done (and Rule3 at least once) so s>=2.\n\n          But note: the Rule2 is the first expansion, and then Rule3 is the second expansion. So the two expansions (two operations) give:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n          Then, the number of terms in the geometric series is 3 (exponents 0 to 2). \n\n          Therefore, we can say: the snowflake has s+1 layers (including the center) and the number of expansion operations is s (each operation adds one layer). Then the total vertices is:\n\n            n = (k^s - 1) / (k-1)   [if we consider the series from exponent0 to exponent(s-1)]?\n\n          Actually, the series from exponent0 to exponent(s-1) is s terms. \n\n          Then, for s=1: (k^1-1)/(k-1)=1 -> only center (invalid).\n          s=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1 -> this is the result after the first expansion (Rule2). Then we must do Rule3 at least once, so we need at least s=3.\n\n          Alternatively, if we let s be the total number of layers (including the center) then:\n\n            n = (k^s - 1) / (k-1)   [with s>=2]\n\n          But wait, the center is one layer (s=1). Then the first expansion (Rule2) adds a second layer (so s=2: n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = 1+k). Then the Rule3 expansion (at least once) adds a third layer (s=3: n = (k^3-1)/(k-1)=1+k+k^2). \n\n          So the minimal s is 3 (three layers). Then the condition is: there exists an integer k>1 and an integer s>=3 such that:\n\n            n = (k^s - 1) / (k-1)\n\n          Then, n=13: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=13 -> k^3-1=13(k-1) -> k^3-13k+12=0 -> k=3: 27-39+12=0 -> valid.\n\n          n=15: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=15 -> k^3-1=15(k-1) -> k^3-15k+14=0 -> k=2: 8-30+14=-8 -> not zero; k=14: 14^3 is 2744, then 2744-15*14+14=2744-210+14=2548 -> not zero. \n                 (k^4-1)/(k-1)=15 -> k^4-1=15(k-1) -> k^4-15k+14=0 -> k=2: 16-30+14=0 -> valid.\n\n          So n=15 is valid.\n\n          Now, n=255: \n            We need to check if 255 can be written as (k^s-1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and s>=3.\n\n            Note: 255 is 2^8-1, so (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255 -> s=8, k=2 -> valid.\n\n          n=10101: \n            We need to check.\n\n          n=1000000000000000000: ?\n\n      However, note: the example input says 1000000000000000000 is NO.\n\n      But wait, the example output:\n\n          ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\n      The last number is 1000000000000000000 -> NO.\n\n      So we must design an algorithm that, for n up to 10^18, checks if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer s>=3 such that:\n\n          n = (k^s - 1) / (k-1)\n\n      How to do that?\n\n      Note: s>=3.\n\n      We can fix s (the number of layers) and solve for k. However, s can be as large as ? \n\n        n = (k^s-1)/(k-1) >= (2^s-1)/(2-1) = 2^s-1.\n\n        Since n <= 10^18, then 2^s-1 <= 10^18 -> 2^s <= 10^18+1 -> s <= log2(10^18) ~ 60.\n\n      So s is at most around 60.\n\n      Then, we can iterate s from 3 to 60 (inclusive) and for each s, try to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n          (k^s - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n      Rearranged:\n\n          k^s - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n          => k^s - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n      Alternatively",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single center vertex. Each subsequent layer is formed by expanding each leaf vertex from the previous layer with \\( k \\) new vertices. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be expressible as \\( (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and integer \\( s \\geq 3 \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with a single vertex (the center). The first expansion adds \\( k \\) vertices, the second expansion adds \\( k^2 \\) vertices, and so on. The total vertices after \\( s \\) expansions (including the initial center) is given by the geometric series sum \\( (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) \\). The problem requires that the expansion step (adding vertices to leaves) is performed at least once, meaning \\( s \\geq 3 \\) (since the first expansion is the center to \\( k \\) vertices, and the next expansion adds \\( k^2 \\) vertices).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( s \\geq 3 \\) such that \\( n = (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) \\). Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can limit our search for \\( s \\) to values up to approximately 60 because \\( 2^s \\) would exceed \\( 10^{18} \\) for \\( s > 60 \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of \\( s \\) from 3 to 60. For each \\( s \\), solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( n = (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) \\). This involves checking if \\( n \\times (k - 1) + 1 \\) is equal to \\( k^s \\). Since \\( k \\) must be an integer greater than 1, we can compute \\( k \\) as the \\( s \\)-th root of \\( n \\times (k - 1) + 1 \\) and verify if it is an integer.\n\n4. **Optimization**: To avoid floating-point inaccuracies, especially for large \\( n \\), we use binary search to find the integer \\( k \\) for each \\( s \\). This ensures that we accurately determine if \\( k^s \\) matches the required value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_case(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    max_exp = 60\n    for s in range(3, max_exp + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total = (mid ** s) - 1\n            denom = mid - 1\n            if denom == 0:\n                if total == 0:\n                    return \"YES\"\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n                    continue\n            if total % denom != 0:\n                high = mid - 1\n                continue\n            k_val = total // denom\n            if k_val == n:\n                return \"YES\"\n            elif k_val < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return \"NO\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        n = int(data[1 + i])\n        results.append(\"YES\" if solve_case(n) == \"YES\" else \"NO\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is 2 or less, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph (since the minimal graph requires at least 7 vertices for \\( k = 2 \\)).\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each test case, iterate over possible numbers of layers \\( s \\) from 3 to 60. For each \\( s \\), perform a binary search to find an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) = n \\).\n3. **Binary Search**: For each \\( s \\), the binary search checks if \\( k^s \\) equals \\( n \\times (k - 1) + 1 \\).
