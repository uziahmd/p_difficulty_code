He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n, k and a list of n integers.\n Conditions: \n   - We have to split the list of n problems into exactly k contiguous segments (each day solves a contiguous sequence from the start).\n   - The profit of a day is the maximum difficulty in that contiguous segment.\n   - We wish to maximize the total profit.\n\n Observation:\n   Since the days must be contiguous and cover the entire list, we are effectively making k-1 cuts between the n problems.\n\n However, note: the problem requires that each day's profit is the maximum of the contiguous segment. Therefore, the overall structure is that we break the array into k contiguous parts.\n\n We can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit we can get after solving the first i problems in j days.\n\n But note: n, k up to 2000, so a O(n^2 * k) solution might be too slow (n=2000 -> 2000^3 operations which is 8e9, too slow in Python).\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We note that the profit for a day is determined by the maximum value in the segment. Also, the entire array is fixed.\n\n Another idea: we know that the maximum total profit must consider the highest values. In fact, we must assign each problem to a day, and the day's profit is at least the maximum value in that day's segment.\n\n However, note: the same maximum value might appear in multiple days? Actually, if a day contains a high value, then that day's profit is at least that high value.\n\n Important: We cannot rearrange the order.\n\n Insight: The entire array must be partitioned. The condition for the j-th day is that it covers a contiguous segment [l, r] and the profit is max_{l<=i<=r} a_i.\n\n We can also think: the last day must end with the last element, and the first day must start with the first element.\n\n How about processing from left to right and considering that the profit of a day is the maximum in the segment. We can use the idea of \"monotonic stack\" to precompute next greater elements or something similar?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems in j days, and we record the last cut position.\n\n But we need to know the maximum in the last segment. We can use the idea of breaking the array and using a sparse table for range maximum queries? But k and n are 2000, so we can do O(n^2*k) if we optimize the inner loop? Actually 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need a better way.\n\n Alternate known approach for such problems (like \"partition array into k contiguous parts to maximize the minimum sum\" but here we maximize the sum of maximums) is to use greedy and two pointers? Or maybe use the fact that the maximum profit we can achieve is bounded by the largest numbers.\n\n Observation: The total profit is the sum over the segments of the maximum in the segment. The maximum in the entire array will be included at least once (on the day that contains the last occurrence of that maximum). Actually, the maximum value in the entire array must appear in one segment and that segment's profit is at least that maximum. But note: if the maximum appears only once, then that day's profit is that maximum. If it appears multiple times, then the day that contains the last occurrence of the maximum must have that maximum as its profit.\n\n However, we can try to use the following:\n\n Let M(i) be the maximum value from index 0 to i (inclusive). Then, if we break the array at some positions, the profit of the last segment (from l to i) is M(i). But the previous segments must have been broken appropriately.\n\n We can use a DP that goes from left to right and uses the fact that the last segment must end at n-1 (the last problem). For the j-th day, the segment ends at some index i (0-indexed). Then:\n\n dp[i][j] = max_{p from 0 to i} { dp[p-1][j-1] } + max_value_in_segment(p, i)\n\n But wait, the segment from p to i has maximum value, say m. How to compute m quickly? We can precompute a 2D RMQ table, but that would be O(n^2) in memory and time, which is acceptable for n=2000? Actually, 2000x2000=4e6, which is acceptable, but then the DP would be O(n^2*k) and 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need to optimize.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving problems over exactly `k` days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The problems must be solved in order, and each day must include at least one problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total profit is the sum of the maximum values in each contiguous segment of problems when the list is split into `k` parts. The challenge is to find the optimal way to split the list into `k` contiguous segments such that the sum of their maximum values is maximized.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of problems solved and `j` represents the number of days. The value `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems in `j` days.\n\n3. **Preprocessing**: We precompute a table `max_val[i][j]` which holds the maximum value between positions `i` and `j` (inclusive) in the problem list. This helps in efficiently determining the maximum value for any segment during the DP computation.\n\n4. **DP Transition**: For each day `j`, we consider all possible ending positions `i` for the segment. For each position `i`, we look back at all possible starting positions `p` for the current segment (from `0` to `i`) and compute the maximum profit by adding the maximum value of the current segment (`max_val[p][i]`) to the profit of the first `p-1` problems in `j-1` days (`dp[p-1][j-1]`).\n\n5. **Result Extraction**: After filling the DP table, the answer is found in `dp[n-1][k]`. To reconstruct the solution, we backtrack from `dp[n-1][k]` to determine the segments used in the optimal split.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        print(sum(a))\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    max_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        cur_max = a[i]\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            if a[j] > cur_max:\n                cur_max = a[j]\n            max_val[i][j] = cur_max\n\n    dp = [[-1]*(k+1) for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][1] = max_val[0][i+1] if i >= 0 else 0\n\n    for days in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(days-1, n):\n            best_prev = -1\n            for p in range(days-1, i+1):\n                if dp[p-1][days-1] != -1:\n                    candidate = dp[p-1][days-1] + max_val[p][i]\n                    if candidate > best_prev:\n                        best_prev = candidate\n            dp[i][days] = best_prev\n\n    total_profit = dp[n-1][k]\n    print(total_profit)\n\n    res = []\n    day_end = n-1\n    for day in range(k, 0, -1):\n        start = 0\n        while dp[day_end][day] != dp[start][day-1] + max_val[start+1][day_end]:\n            start += 1\n        res.append(day_end - start + 1)\n        day_end = start - 1\n\n    res.reverse()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values and checks if only one day is needed, in which case the total profit is simply the sum of all problem difficulties.\n2. **Preprocessing**: The `max_val` table is constructed to store the maximum value between any two indices `i` and `j`, allowing quick lookup during DP computation.\n3. **DP Table Setup**: The DP table is initialized for the base case of one day, where the profit is the maximum value in the segment from the start to the current index.\n4. **DP Table Population**: For each subsequent day, the DP table is updated by considering all possible segments ending at each index, leveraging the precomputed `max_val` table to determine segment maximums.\n5. **Result Extraction**: The maximum profit is found in `dp[n-1][k]`. The solution is reconstructed by backtracking through the DP table to identify the optimal segments, which are then printed in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum profit by leveraging dynamic programming and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
