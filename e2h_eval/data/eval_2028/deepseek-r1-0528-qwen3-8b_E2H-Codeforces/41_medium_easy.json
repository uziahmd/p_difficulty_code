There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) or even try to use state compression by considering the restrictions.\n However, note that the restrictions are given as intervals and we have multiple restrictions. We can use the idea of \"minimum allowed height\" in each segment? Actually, for each spot, the height must be <= min(x_i for all restrictions that cover this spot). But note: the restrictions might conflict? Actually, they are independent and we have to satisfy all.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each spot j, the minimum maximum allowed height from the restrictions that cover j. However, note: the restrictions say \"the tallest house from [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i\". This implies that for a spot j, if there are multiple restrictions, then the height at j must be at most the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include j? Actually, no: consider two restrictions that both include j: one says \"tallest in [a,b] <= x1\", another says \"tallest in [c,d] <= x2\", then j is included in both, so the house at j must be <= x1 and <= x2. Therefore, the height at j must be at most min_{all restrictions covering j} x_i.\n\n But wait: what if two restrictions don't necessarily constrain the same house? Actually, the restriction only constrains the entire interval. However, for a single house at j, if it is covered by a restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i) then the entire interval must have a maximum <= x_i, so the house at j must be <= x_i. Therefore, the house at j must be <= min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i.\n\n However, note: there's also the global constraint that the house cannot exceed h. So the effective maximum height for a spot j is: \n   max_height[j] = min(h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i)\n\n But wait: what if there are no restrictions covering j? Then we take min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i over an empty set? Then we should set it to h? Actually, we can define:\n   base_max[j] = h   (if no restriction, then the only constraint is h)\n   but if there are restrictions, then we take the minimum x_i from the restrictions that cover j and then clamp by h.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\". And the restrictions add additional constraints (if any). So the effective constraint for spot j is:\n   effective_max[j] = min(h, min_{each restriction i that includes j} x_i)\n\n But note: the restrictions are independent and must be satisfied. This formulation ensures that.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Consider: if we set each house to its effective_max[j], then does that satisfy all restrictions?\n For a restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i): the tallest house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. But we set each house j to at most min_{k covering j} x_k. Now, if we set house j to exactly effective_max[j] (or less), then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most the maximum of { effective_max[j] for j in [l_i, r_i] }.\n\n But note: effective_max[j] = min_{k: j in [l_k, r_k]} x_k. In the interval [l_i, r_i], for each j, effective_max[j] <= x_i because j is in [l_i, r_i] and so the restriction i applies to j, hence effective_max[j] <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. So yes, satisfying each house not to exceed its effective_max[j] (which is the minimum of all x_i for which j is in [l_i, r_i]) ensures that every restriction is met.\n\n However, is that the maximum profit? Not necessarily. Because we might set a house lower than its effective_max[j] to allow adjacent houses to be higher? But wait, the restrictions are independent per house? Actually, no. The profit function is separable: profit = sum_{j=1}^{n} (height_j)^2. And the constraint for each house j is independent (each house j cannot exceed effective_max[j]). \n\n Then why the example [1,3,2] for the first example? Let's compute effective_max for each spot:\n\n Example 1: \n   Restrictions: \n      1: [1,1] <= 1 -> effective_max[1] = min(3,1)=1\n      2: [2,2] <= 3 -> effective_max[2] = min(3,3)=3\n      3: [3,3] <= 2 -> effective_max[3] = min(3,2)=2\n\n Then we can set house1 to 1, house2 to 3, house3 to 2. That gives 1^2+3^2+2^2=14.\n\n But note: the second example: \n   Input: 4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n   Compute effective_max for each spot:\n      Spot1: no restriction -> 10\n      Spot2: in [2,3] -> min(10,8)=8\n      Spot3: in [2,3] and [3,4] -> min(10,8,7)=7\n      Spot4: in [3,4] -> min(10,7)=7\n\n   Then the maximum profit would be: 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262.\n\n   Which matches the example.\n\n So the solution becomes:\n   Step 1: Precompute for each spot j (from 1 to n) the effective maximum height.\n\n   How to do that?\n     Initialize an array `max_allowed` of length n (for spots 1..n) to h (the global maximum).\n     For each restriction (l, r, x):\n         For each spot j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) in the array, update:\n             max_allowed[j] = min(max_allowed[j], x)\n\n     But wait: is that correct? Actually, the above update sets the effective_max for spot j to the minimum of the global h and all the x's from the restrictions that cover j. However, we are only updating with the restrictions' x, and initially we set to h. Then we take the min with x for each restriction that covers j.\n\n   Step 2: Now, we want to assign a height a_j (integer) for each spot j, such that 0 <= a_j <= max_allowed[j], and maximize sum_{j}(a_j^2).\n\n   Since the profit function is separable and the constraints are independent, the best for each spot j is to set a_j = max_allowed[j] (because the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers). \n\n   Why? Because if we set a_j to a value less than max_allowed[j], we lose some profit. And since there are no interactions (the restrictions are already accounted for by the max_allowed[j] and the profit is additive), we can independently choose the maximum allowed value for each house.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum profit is the sum of (max_allowed[j]^2) for j from 0 to n-1.\n\n   But wait: let me check the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        max_allowed = [1, 3, 2]\n        profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example 2:\n        max_allowed = [10, 8, 7, 7]\n        profit = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   However, wait: what if there is a restriction that doesn't set the maximum for a house, but we still have the possibility to set a house higher than the restriction? Actually, our computation of max_allowed[j] already considers all restrictions that cover j, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: what if two restrictions overlap and one has a lower x? Then the house must be <= the lower x. Our update (min) captures that.\n\n   However, note: the input says there are m restrictions, and each restriction is given by [l_i, r_i] and x_i. We must consider every restriction that covers the spot.\n\n   But note: what if a restriction does not cover a particular spot? Then we don't update that spot for that restriction, so the initial value h remains. And that is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is straightforward:\n\n     Read n, h, m.\n     Initialize an array `arr` of length n (index 0 to n-1) with h (the maximum allowed for each spot initially).\n\n     For each of the m lines:\n         Read l, r, x.\n         For j from l-1 to r-1 (converting to 0-indexed) in the array, set:\n             arr[j] = min(arr[j], x)\n\n     Then, for each element in arr, we set the house to that value (because the square function is increasing and we are constrained by that value, so we take the maximum allowed).\n\n     Then, compute the profit: for each value v in arr, add v*v.\n\n     Print the total profit.\n\n   Let me test with a small example that might be tricky:\n\n     Example 3: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1\n        restriction: 1 1 5\n\n        Then arr[0] = min(10,5)=5, profit=25.\n\n     Example 4:\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: 1 2 5\n        Restriction2: 1 2 7\n\n        Then for both spots: \n            Initially: [10,10]\n            After restriction1: [5,5]\n            After restriction2: [min(5,7)=5, min(5,7)=5] -> same.\n\n     Example 5:\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: 1 1 5\n        Restriction2: 2 2 7\n\n        Then arr = [min(10,5)=5, min(10,7)=7] -> profit=25+49=74.\n\n   But wait, what if we have overlapping restrictions with different x's? The above method correctly takes the minimum x that applies to the spot.\n\n   However, wait: is there a possibility that a restriction might be redundant? Yes, but we are taking the minimum so it's okay.\n\n   But note: the problem says the restrictions are independent and we must satisfy all. So the house must be <= the smallest x_i of the restrictions that cover it.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n     n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n     arr = [h] * n   # n elements, each initially h\n\n     for _ in range(m):\n         data = input().split()\n         l = int(data[0])\n         r = int(data[1])\n         x_val = int(data[2])\n         for j in range(l-1, r):\n             if x_val < arr[j]:\n                 arr[j] = x_val\n\n     total = 0\n     for val in arr:\n         total += val * val\n\n     print(total)\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\", then three restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n        arr = [3,3,3] initially.\n        First restriction: [0:0] becomes min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n        Second restriction: [1:1] becomes min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3] (no change)\n        Third restriction: [2:2] becomes min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n        Profit: 1+9+4 = 14 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\", then two restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n        arr = [10,10,10,10]\n        First restriction: from index 1 to 2 (0-indexed indices 1 and 2) set to min(10,8)=8 -> [10,8,8,10] -> wait, wait! The example has four houses: the first restriction is from spot2 to spot3 (so indices 1 to 2). Then we set arr[1] and arr[2] to 8.\n        Then second restriction: from spot3 to spot4 (indices 2 to 3) set to min(10,7)=7 -> so arr[2]=min(8,7)=7, arr[3]=min(10,7)=7.\n        Then arr = [10,8,7,7] -> profit=100+64+49+49=262 -> matches.\n\n   However, wait: in the example the first restriction was on spots 2 to 3, which in 0-indexed are indices 1 to 2. So the update for the first restriction: \n        j from 1 to 2 (inclusive) -> set arr[1] and arr[2] to 8.\n\n   Then the second restriction: j from 2 to 3 (inclusive) -> set arr[2] and arr[3] to 7.\n\n   So the array becomes: \n        index0: 10\n        index1: 8\n        index2: 7\n        index3: 7\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the spots are labeled 1 to n. We are using 0-indexed so the first spot is index0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the first example input is given as:\n        '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'\n\n   But note: the example input format: the first line is \"3 3 3\", then three lines of restrictions.\n\n   We are reading the first line and then the next m lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple restrictions that update the same house? We are iterating and updating by taking the minimum. That is correct because the house must satisfy all restrictions, so the maximum allowed is the minimum of all the x_i that apply to it.\n\n   However, note: the order of updating doesn't matter because we are taking the minimum. We can update in any order.\n\n   But note: the problem says the restrictions are independent and we have to satisfy all, so the minimum x_i for the house is the tightest constraint.\n\n   Therefore, the code below should work.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says the maximum height overall is h, and the restrictions are given. We are using h as the initial value. Then we update with the restrictions.\n\n   One more edge: if there are no restrictions, then the array remains [h, h, ..., h] and the profit is n * h^2.\n\n   Example: n=2, h=3, m=0 -> profit= 3^2 + 3^2 = 9+9=18.\n\n   But what if h=0? Then the profit is 0.\n\n   Since n, h, m are at least 1, and h>=0, it's okay.\n\n   Let me run the code for the examples.\n\n   However, wait: the example input is provided as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says the input is from stdin.\n\n   We are reading the first line and then m lines.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But in the actual program, we read from stdin.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n   for _ in range(m):\n       data = input().split()\n       l = int(data[0])\n       r = int(data[1])\n       x_val = int(data[2])\n       # Update from l-1 to r-1 (both inclusive) in the array\n       for j in range(l-1, r):\n           if j < n:   # to be safe, but j is from l-1 to r-1, and r<=n, so j goes from l-1 to r-1, which is at most n-1.\n               if x_val < arr[j]:\n                   arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for val in arr:\n       total += val * val\n\n   print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the example input for the second example is:\n\n        \"4 10 2\"\n        \"2 3 8\"\n        \"3 4 7\"\n\n   In the second restriction: l=3, r=4, so j from 2 to 3 (0-indexed). But our array has 4 elements (index0 to index3). So j=2 and j=3. Then we set arr[2] = min(arr[2],7) and arr[3]=min(arr[3],7). But initially after the first restriction, arr[2] was 8, so becomes 7. And arr[3] was 10, becomes 7.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait: what if a restriction has r greater than n? The problem states: 1<=l<=r<=n, so r is at most n, and we have n elements (from 0 to n-1). So j from l-1 to r-1 is valid.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input has m restrictions, and we are reading m lines. We assume that the input is exactly as described.\n\n   Let's submit.\n\n   But wait: there is a catch. What if the same spot is updated multiple times? Our code updates with the minimum x_val encountered so far. But we are processing each restriction one by one, and we update the entire segment with the current x_val. However, if we get two restrictions that update the same spot, the second one might be a smaller x_val and then we update again. This is correct because the house must be <= the smallest x_val from all restrictions.\n\n   However, the above code does not update the entire segment with the minimum of the current x_val and the current value. It updates each element in the segment to be the minimum of the current value and x_val. But if we have two restrictions that both cover the same spot, and the first one sets it to a low value, then the second one (with a higher x_val) will not change it. And that is correct because the constraint is the smallest x_val.\n\n   But note: the above code updates the entire segment for each restriction. That means if we have two restrictions that cover the same segment, we update the same segment twice. That is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by not updating if x_val is already greater than the current value? But the problem is small (n, m <=50) so it's okay.\n\n   But wait: what if a restriction has a very high x_val? Then we don't need to update. But the condition is: if x_val < arr[j] then update. Otherwise, skip. This is correct.\n\n   So the code is efficient enough.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the restrictions are independent and we have to satisfy all. Our method ensures that for each spot j, the value is the minimum of h and all the x_i from the restrictions that cover j.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   But wait: let me test with an example that has two restrictions that update the same spot with different x_vals, one first and then the other.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: 1 1 5\n        Restriction2: 1 1 7\n\n        Then the array starts at [10]. \n        First restriction: set to 5.\n        Second restriction: 5 < 7 -> no update. So the house is 5.\n\n   But the second restriction says the house must be <=7, and 5<=7, so that's okay. However, the first restriction requires <=5, so the house must be <=5. The second restriction is less restrictive. So the minimum of 5 and 7 is 5, which is correct.\n\n   Another order: \n        Restriction1: 1 1 7\n        Restriction2: 1 1 5\n\n        Then first: set to 7, then second: 5<7 -> set to 5.\n\n   So the order doesn't matter because we are taking the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the restrictions are given arbitrarily. We must process them in the given order? Actually, no, because we are updating each spot to the minimum x_val from all the restrictions that cover it. The order of processing does not matter for the final value of arr[j] (since we are taking the minimum, which is commutative). So we can process in any order.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n   for i in range(m):\n       l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n       for j in range(l-1, r):\n           if x_val < arr[j]:\n               arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for num in arr:\n       total += num * num\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But wait: the example input is provided as a string in the example, but the problem reads from stdin.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n   I'll run the code with these inputs.\n\n   However, wait: the example input for the second example is given as:\n\n        ['4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But in the code, we are reading from stdin. So if we run:\n\n        $ python3 solution.py\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n   Then we get 262.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list of two strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But that is just an example representation. In reality, we read from stdin.\n\n   I think we are good.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples. But note that the example input might have been provided as two separate test cases? Actually, no: the problem says \"You are planning to build...\", and the input format is as described.\n\n   The input for the problem is one test case. The examples are two separate test cases.\n\n   Our code reads one test case. If the input has multiple test cases, we must adjust. But the problem statement says:\n\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\n   Then m lines.\n\n   So it is one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code as above.\n\n   But wait: the example input is provided as a list of two strings, meaning two test cases? Actually, the example input format in the problem statement is two examples. But the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so one test case per run.\n\n   The problem does not specify multiple test cases, so we assume one.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Note: There's one more possibility: what if a restriction has x_val greater than h? Then we update the array with min(arr[j], x_val) but since arr[j] is initially h and x_val > h, then we don't update. But note: the restriction says the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_val. However, if x_val > h, then the constraint is automatically satisfied because the house cannot exceed h. But wait: the problem says the house can be between 0 and h. So if x_val > h, then the constraint is effectively the same as h. \n\n   However, our method uses the minimum of h and the restrictions' x_val. But wait: we did not use h in the update. Actually, we set the initial value to h, and then update with the minimum of the current value and x_val. So if x_val > h, then the update condition (x_val < arr[j]) is false because arr[j] is h and x_val>h, so we leave arr[j] as h. That is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a restriction with x_val > h? Then the effective constraint for the house is h (because the house cannot exceed h anyway). So we are correct.\n\n   However, the problem says the house must be between 0 and h. The restriction says the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_i. If x_i > h, then the constraint is redundant. So we don't need to update.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with x_val > h.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction: 1 1 10\n        Then arr[0] = min(5,10) -> but wait, we don't update because 10 is not less than 5. So we leave it at 5. Then profit=25.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=5, m=2, restrictions: [1,1,10] and [1,1,3]\n        Process first restriction: 10>5 -> no update.\n        Process second restriction: 3<5 -> update to 3. Then profit=9.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n   for i in range(m):\n       data = input().split()\n       l = int(data[0])\n       r = int(data[1])\n       x_val = int(data[2])\n       # Iterate from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive)\n       for j in range(l-1, r):\n           if x_val < arr[j]:\n               arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for num in arr:\n       total += num * num\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me submit.\n\n   But wait, wait: the problem says the restrictions are given, and the house must be <= the minimum x_i for all restrictions covering the spot. However, note: the restriction says \"the tallest house in [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i\". This means that the entire interval [l_i, r_i] must have all houses <= x_i. So if we set one house to x_i, then the entire interval must be <= x_i. But our method sets each house to the minimum of all the x_i (from the restrictions that cover it) and h. Then the entire interval [l_i, r_i] will have houses <= x_i (because the house at any spot j in [l_i, r_i] is set to <= x_i, since x_i is one of the restrictions and we take the minimum). \n\n   However, note: we are setting each house individually to the minimum x_i that applies to it. But what if a restriction covers an interval and we set each house to the minimum x_i that applies to it, but the minimum x_i for a house j might come from a restriction that does not cover the entire interval? \n\n   Example: n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x2=3\n\n        Then for spot1: covered by both -> min(10,5,3)=3.\n        For spot2: covered by Restriction1 -> min(10,5)=5.\n\n        Then the array is [3,5]. \n        Check Restriction1: the tallest house in [1,2] is max(3,5)=5 <=5 -> okay.\n        Check Restriction2: the tallest house in [1,1] is 3<=3 -> okay.\n\n   But note: the house2 is set to 5, which is the minimum of the x_i from Restriction1 (and no other restriction) and h. \n\n   However, what if we set house2 to 5, but the Restriction2 only applies to house1. The Restriction1 applies to both. \n\n   The key is: the Restriction1 requires the entire interval [1,2] to have houses <=5. We set house1 to 3 (which is <=5) and house2 to 5 (<=5). So it satisfies.\n\n   Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   I think we are ready.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says the house must be built with an integer height between 0 and h. We are setting the house to the effective_max, which is an integer between 0 and h. But note: the effective_max might be 0 (if all restrictions covering a spot have x_i=0). Then the house must be 0. The square of 0 is 0.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,1] 0 -> then house is 0, profit=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples and edge cases.\n\n   Edge Case 1: n=0? The problem says n>=1.\n\n   Edge Case 2: h=0, n=1, m=0 -> profit=0.\n\n   Edge Case 3: m=0 -> then we use h for all houses.\n\n   Example: n=2, h=3, m=0 -> profit= 3^2+3^2=18.\n\n   Edge Case 4: m=0, but h=0 -> 0.\n\n   Edge Case 5: multiple restrictions with same x_val.\n\n   All seems to be covered.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input is from stdin. We are using input(), which is standard.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input has m restrictions. We are reading m lines.\n\n   One more thing: the input might have leading/trailing spaces? The split() method handles that.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Note: The problem says n, h, m are at least 1 and at most 50. So the above loops (m up to 50 and each loop up to n (at most 50)) is 50*50=2500 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n   for _ in range(m):\n       l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n       for j in range(l-1, r):\n           if x_val < arr[j]:\n               arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for val in arr:\n       total += val * val\n\n   print(total)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints are that each house's height must not exceed a specified maximum height, which is derived from all the zoning restrictions that apply to its spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied and the total profit (sum of squares of heights) is maximized. Each restriction imposes a constraint that the tallest house in a certain interval must not exceed a given height. The key insight is that for each house, the effective maximum height is the minimum of all the maximum heights specified by the restrictions covering that house, clamped by the global maximum height \\( h \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowed height is determined by the strictest restriction (smallest \\( x_i \\)) that includes it. By setting each house's height to this effective maximum, we ensure all restrictions are satisfied. Since the profit function is separable (each house's contribution is independent), setting each house to its maximum allowed height maximizes the total profit.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an array with the global maximum height \\( h \\) for each house.\n   - For each zoning restriction, update the corresponding houses' maximum allowed heights to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's \\( x_i \\).\n   - After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights in the array.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each house in its interval. With \\( n \\) houses and \\( m \\) restrictions, the worst-case time complexity is \\( O(m \\times n) \\), which is efficient given the constraints \\( n, m \\leq 50 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    arr = [h] * n\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n                \n    total = 0\n    for val in arr:\n        total += val * val\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are \\( n \\) (number of spots), \\( h \\) (global maximum height), and \\( m \\) (number of restrictions).\n2. **Initialization**: An array `arr` is initialized with \\( h \\) for each spot, representing the initial maximum height without any restrictions.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the relevant spots in the array to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's \\( x_i \\). This ensures all restrictions are accounted for in the effective maximum height for each spot.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the total profit is computed by summing the squares of the heights in the array. The result is printed as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the maximum profit is achieved while adhering to all zoning restrictions.",
