The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The subsegment must be strictly increasing after the change (if any change is done).\n\n Approach:\n 1. We can consider two cases: \n    a) The entire segment is already strictly increasing. Then we can use the whole array.\n    b) Otherwise, we can try to remove one \"bad\" element (where the strictly increasing condition fails) and see if we can merge some increasing parts.\n\n However, note that the problem allows changing one element arbitrarily. So we can fix one element to be changed and then check the longest contiguous subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by fixing that one element.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the longest subsegment (which may not necessarily be contiguous in the original array? Actually, the subsegment must be contiguous). \n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define an array `strictly_increasing` such that `dp[i]` is the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i (without any changes). This can be computed as:\n\n   dp[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            dp[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, we can define an array `from_right` such that `right[i]` is the length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting at i.\n\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n Now, the idea is to consider every index i (from 0 to n-1) and imagine that we are going to change the element at i to something that will fix the sequence. Then we can combine the left part (from j to i-1) and the right part (from i+1 to k) with the fixed element at i.\n\n However, note that the fixed element must be chosen so that:\n   - The left part (if exists) must end at i-1 and the last element of the left part (a[i-1]) must be less than the fixed element.\n   - The fixed element must be less than the first element of the right part (if exists) which is a[i+1].\n\n But we are allowed to choose the fixed element arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set:\n   - If there is no left part, then we only need to set the fixed element to be less than a[i+1] (if there is a right part) or arbitrary if no right part.\n   - Similarly, if there is no right part, then set the fixed element to be greater than a[i-1] (if there is a left part).\n   - If both sides exist, then we must have a[i-1] < x < a[i+1]. This is possible only if a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Otherwise, we cannot merge both sides.\n\n However, note: we are also allowed to have the entire segment being just [i] (if we change it and no adjacent elements are considered, but then the segment can be just one element, which is trivially strictly increasing). But we are looking for the maximum.\n\n But note: we might not even change the element at i, but then we have to consider segments without including i? Actually, the problem allows at most one change. So we can also consider segments that do not require a change.\n\n However, note that the problem requires to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one number. So we are allowed to not change any number as well.\n\n Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Without any change, the longest strictly increasing contiguous subsegment.\n\n   Option 2: With one change, we can potentially extend a segment by including an element that we fix.\n\n How to handle:\n\n Let's consider the following:\n\n   Case 1: Entire segment is already strictly increasing -> answer is n.\n\n   But what if we have a segment that is not strictly increasing, but we can fix one element and get a longer segment?\n\n We can try to consider each index i as the one we change, and then combine the left and right parts.\n\n Steps for one index i:\n\n   Let L = the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending at i-1 (if i>=1, otherwise 0)\n   Let R = the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting at i+1 (if i<n-1, otherwise 0)\n\n   Then, if we fix the element at i, the entire segment from (i-L) to (i+R) would be made strictly increasing if we can choose a value for a[i] that is between the last element of the left part (if any) and the first element of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the array to determine the maximum possible length of such a subsegment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous subsegment that can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence by altering at most one element. The key observation is that any valid subsegment must either already be strictly increasing or can be formed by merging two strictly increasing subsegments with a single change in between.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Precompute Arrays**: We first compute two arrays, `dp` and `right`, where:\n     - `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n     - `right[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n   - **Check Each Index**: For each index `i` in the array, consider it as the potential element to be changed. The goal is to merge the left and right subsegments around `i` if possible.\n   - **Conditions for Merging**: The left subsegment ending at `i-1` and the right subsegment starting at `i+1` can be merged if the last element of the left subsegment is less than the first element of the right subsegment. In this case, we can choose a value for `a[i]` that lies between these two elements, thus merging the two subsegments.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the entire array is already strictly increasing or where merging is not possible (e.g., when there are no elements on either side of `i`).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array, because we process each element a constant number of times. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the `dp` and `right` arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    dp = [1] * n\n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = max(max(dp), max(right_arr))\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        L = dp[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0\n        R = right_arr[i+1] if i+1 < n else 0\n        \n        if i-1 >= 0 and i+1 < n:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                best = max(best, L + 1 + R)\n        elif i-1 >= 0:\n            best = max(best, L + 1)\n        elif i+1 < n:\n            best = max(best, R + 1)\n        else:\n            best = max(best, 1)\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the size of the array `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the array size `n` is zero, the result is trivially zero.\n3. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - `dp` array is filled such that `dp[i]` holds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right_arr` array is filled such that `right_arr[i]` holds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n4. **Initial Best Length**: The initial best length is the maximum value found in either `dp` or `right_arr`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Check Each Index**: For each index `i`, the algorithm checks if merging the left and right subsegments around `i` is possible. If so, it updates the best length accordingly.\n6. **Output Result**: The maximum length found is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one change, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
