    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph.\n   and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with n nodes.\n\n Conditions for p-reachable:\n   The graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and there is a path from u to v and from v to u.\n\n Note: In a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k, the condition (u < v and mutual reachability) is satisfied for every pair (u, v) with u < v in that SCC. However, note that the problem says \"exactly p\", so we are counting unordered pairs (with u < v) that are mutually reachable. But note: the definition of the graph being p-reachable is having exactly p such pairs.\n\n However, note that the entire graph might have multiple SCCs? But wait: if the graph has more than one SCC, then the mutual reachability condition requires that u and v are in the same SCC? Actually, no: if the graph is not strongly connected, then we can have multiple SCCs, but then the condition for mutual reachability must hold only within each SCC. Moreover, the problem states that the graph is p-reachable, meaning it has exactly p pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n Let's denote by S the set of SCCs. Then the total number of mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(|SCC|, 2). Therefore, we are looking for a decomposition of the graph into SCCs such that the sum of C(|SCC_i|,2) is exactly p.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have a graph that is not strongly connected? Actually, the graph must be p-reachable, which means having exactly p mutual pairs. However, we can also have edges between SCCs, but these edges cannot form cycles (since then they would be merged into one SCC). So we can arrange the graph as a DAG of SCCs.\n\n Important: The problem does not require the entire graph to be strongly connected. It only requires that the total number of mutual pairs (i.e., pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability) is exactly p.\n\n However, note: mutual reachability implies being in the same SCC. So the total p must be the sum of C(|SCC_i|,2) for all SCCs.\n\n Now, we are to minimize the total number of nodes. We can use as many nodes as we want, but we want the minimum.\n\n How to represent the graph? We can use a set of complete directed graphs on each SCC (so that every node in the SCC can reach every other node in the same SCC) and then connect the SCCs in a topological order (so that edges go from one SCC to another, but not backwards). This way, mutual reachability is only within each SCC.\n\n Then, the condition is: we need to write p as a sum of triangular numbers (each term being C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2) and we want to minimize the total number of nodes, which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs.\n\n But note: we can break the graph into multiple SCCs. However, we are free to choose the sizes of the SCCs. Also note that we can have a single SCC (then the entire graph is strongly connected) and then p = C(n,2) = n*(n-1)//2. Or we can have two or more SCCs.\n\n We are to find the minimum n (total nodes) such that there exists a multiset of positive integers (each at least 1) {k1, k2, ..., km} (m is the number of SCCs) with:\n      k1 + k2 + ... + km = n\n      and T(k1) + T(k2) + ... + T(km) = p\n\n where T(k) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use all the nodes in the graph? Actually, the graph must have exactly n nodes (and we are to minimize n). But we can choose to have some nodes not included? No, because the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. And the mutual pairs are only from the SCCs. So we can have a graph that uses exactly n nodes, and we break these n nodes into SCCs.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have isolated nodes? An isolated node forms an SCC of size 1, and T(1)=0. So we can have isolated nodes without contributing to p.\n\n However, the problem says \"minimum number of nodes required\". So we can use as few nodes as necessary. We want the minimal n such",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and there is mutual reachability between u and v. This means the graph must decompose into strongly connected components (SCCs) such that the sum of combinations of nodes within each SCC equals p. Specifically, for an SCC of size k, the number of mutual pairs is \\( \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: The goal is to minimize the total number of nodes (n) such that the sum of \\( \\binom{k_i}{2} \\) for all SCCs equals p. The optimal way to minimize n is to use as few SCCs as possible, each contributing maximally to p. This involves using SCCs of sizes that are as large as possible but ensuring their combination sums to p.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: For graphs with the minimum number of nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not vice versa) is derived by considering the structure of the graph. The solution involves constructing the graph such that it has a hierarchical structure of SCCs connected in a topological order, maximizing edges that go in one direction between different SCCs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    p = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    remaining = p\n    while True:\n        t_n = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        if t_n <= remaining:\n            remaining -= t_n\n            n += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    m = n - 1\n    total_nodes = 0\n    remaining_nodes = m\n    \n    while remaining_nodes > 0:\n        k = remaining_nodes\n        t_val = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if t_val <= remaining:\n            remaining -= t_val\n            total_nodes += k\n            remaining_nodes -= 1\n        else:\n            total_nodes += remaining_nodes\n            break\n\n    n_min = total_nodes\n\n    max_uni_pairs = 0\n    total_possible_edges = n_min * (n_min - 1)\n    strong_components = []\n    remaining_p = p\n    scc_sizes = []\n    total_nodes_used = 0\n    \n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        k = len(scc_sizes) + 1\n        tri_k = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if tri_k <= remaining_p:\n            remaining_p -= tri_k\n            scc_sizes.append(1)\n        else:\n            scc_sizes.append(remaining_p + len(scc_sizes))\n            remaining_p = 0\n            break\n\n    num_sccs = len(scc_sizes)\n    total_nodes = sum(scc_sizes)\n\n    for i in range(num_sccs):\n        for j in range(i + 1, num_sccs):\n            size_i = scc_sizes[i]\n            size_j = scc_sizes[j]\n            max_uni_pairs += size_i * size_j\n\n    unidirectional_pairs = max_uni_pairs\n\n    print(f\"{n_min} {unidirectional_pairs}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the integer p, which represents the number of required mutual pairs.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution is straightforward: no nodes or edges are needed.\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The algorithm calculates the minimum number of nodes by iteratively subtracting the maximum possible triangular numbers (representing SCCs) from p until the remainder is less than the next triangular number. This ensures the sum of SCC contributions equals p with minimal nodes.\n4. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived by considering all possible edges between different SCCs in a topological order. Each pair of nodes from different SCCs contributes to unidirectional edges if they are reachable in one direction but not the other.\n5. **Output**: The solution outputs the minimum number of nodes and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for graphs with that node count.\n\nThis approach efficiently decomposes the problem into manageable parts, leveraging mathematical insights about triangular numbers and graph decomposition to achieve the solution.",
