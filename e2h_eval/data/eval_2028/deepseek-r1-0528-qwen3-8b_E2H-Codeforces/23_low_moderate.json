In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in one line, but each string is a tile? Actually, the input format: \n \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n However, looking at the example input: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three separate examples. The problem says: \n   Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n Actually, the example input is provided in a way that there are three test cases, but the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input format is one line containing three strings (each string being a tile representation). \n\n However, the example input is shown with three examples. Let me re-read: \n   Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n So, for each test case, we have one line with three tiles? Or multiple test cases? \n\n Wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input with three lines of examples, but note that the example input is written as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is actually three separate inputs. But the problem says the input is one line with three strings (meaning three tiles). \n\n Actually, the example input has three examples, so probably the problem expects multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\n Let me check the problem statement: \n   \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n So, for each run, we get one line with three strings (each string is a tile). \n\n However, the example output is:\n   ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This implies that there are three separate test cases. But wait, the problem says \"The only line\" for the input. \n\n Clarification from the example: \n   Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> Output: 0\n   Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\" -> Output: 0\n   Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\" -> Output: 1\n\n But the problem says the input is one line with three strings. \n\n Actually, the example input is provided as three examples. In competitive programming problems, sometimes they give multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the only line\", meaning one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the example output is printed as three numbers. \n\n I think I misread the example. The problem says:\n\n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n   Output: ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This means that the input is one string that contains three tiles? Or is the input actually three lines?\n\n Looking again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So, one line has three strings (each string is a tile). Then how do we have three examples? \n\n The problem might be intended to have multiple test cases, but the problem statement does not specify that. \n\n However, note that the example input is given as a list of three strings. In many competitive programming problems, if there are multiple test cases, they will specify the number of test cases. Here, there is no such specification.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be: \n   There is only one test case, but the example shows three different inputs and outputs for illustration.\n\n But the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n So, we must read one line that contains three strings (tiles) and output one integer.\n\n Therefore, the example input is actually three separate runs? Or the example input is given as three examples and we have to write code that handles one test case.\n\n Since the problem says \"The only line\", we assume one test case per run.\n\n However, the example output is provided for three different inputs. \n\n To clarify, let's consider:\n\n   Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> Output: 0\n   Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\" -> Output: 0\n   Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\" -> Output: 1\n\n But the problem says the input is one line with three strings. \n\n Now, wait: the example input is written as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is a list of three strings,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m]).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n   - The goal is to check if the given three tiles already form a mentsu. If not, calculate the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: If there are three identical tiles, no tiles need to be drawn.\n   - **Sequence Check**: If the three tiles are in the same suit and their numbers form a sequence (consecutive or can be arranged consecutively), then they form a sequence.\n   - **Edge Cases**: \n     - If the hand has fewer than three tiles, more draws are needed. However, the problem states there are exactly three tiles initially.\n     - Tiles can be drawn from an infinite pool, so any tile can be drawn any number of times.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for Triplet**: Count occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears three times, the answer is 0.\n   - **Check for Sequence**: Group tiles by suit and sort their numbers. For each suit, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n   - **Calculate Minimum Draws**: \n     - If no mentsu is found, the solution involves drawing tiles to form a triplet (requiring 3 - count of a specific tile) or a sequence (requiring 1 or 2 additional tiles to complete a sequence).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves checking all possible tiles (9 suits × 9 numbers = 81 unique tiles), which is constant time O(1) due to the fixed problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = data\n\n    # Check for koutsu (triplets)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_dict[tile] += 1\n\n    # Check if any tile appears three times\n    for tile, count_val in count_dict.items():\n        if count_val >= 3:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # Check for shuntsu (sequences)\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    num_mapping = {'1': 1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9}\n    \n    # Group by suit\n    suit_groups = {suit: [] for suit in suits}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num_char = tile[0]\n        suit_char = tile[1]\n        if num_char in '123456789':\n            num_val = num_mapping[num_char]\n            suit_groups[suit_char].append(num_val)\n\n    # Check each suit group for sequences\n    for suit, nums in suit_groups.items():\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        sorted_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(sorted_nums)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if sorted_nums[i] + 1 == sorted_nums[i+1] and sorted_nums[i+1] + 1 == sorted_nums[i+2]:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n    # Now, consider drawing tiles to form a mentsu\n    # We have three tiles.

But wait, we only have three tiles total.\n                # Alternatively, we can consider drawing one tile to complete the sequence.\n                # Example: [1m, 2m] -> we can draw 3m to complete the sequence.\n                # But also [2m, 3m] -> draw 1m or 4m? However, the hand has three tiles. In our case, we have two tiles in the same suit and the third tile might be different.\n                # Actually, the hand has three tiles. Let's break down:\n                #   We have two tiles in the same suit, say [1m, 2m], and the third tile is something else (say 9m). Then drawing 3m completes the sequence.\n                #   But if the third tile is also in the same suit, then we might have three tiles in the same suit. Then we should have checked the sequence earlier.\n                # Since we didn't find a sequence, the third tile is not helping. So we just need one more tile to complete the sequence.\n                # However, what if the two tiles are not consecutive? Then we cannot complete with one tile.\n                # Correction: We are iterating over suits and within a suit, we look at the set of numbers. We found two consecutive numbers. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing one tile (either the number before the first or after the second, provided it doesn't conflict).\n                # But note: the sequence must be three consecutive numbers. So if we have [x, x+1] then we need either x-1 or x+2. But we cannot draw two tiles at once, so we can only complete one sequence per draw.\n                # However, the problem asks for the minimum number of draws. So if we can complete a sequence with one draw, we output 1.\n                # But note: we are only considering the same suit. And we have three tiles in total. The two tiles are in the same suit and consecutive, and the third tile is irrelevant for this sequence. So yes, one draw is sufficient.\n                print(1)\n                return\n            elif gap == 2:\n                # Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing number.\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # Another possibility: two different suits but same number? Then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of the same tile (if two are already present) but we already checked for two same tiles above.\n\n    # What if we don't have any two same tiles and no two consecutive in the same suit?\n    # Then we need to draw either three tiles (to form a triplet) or two tiles (to form a sequence). But note, forming a sequence requires three consecutive numbers, so if we have two non-consecutive tiles in the same suit, we might need two draws to form a sequence (if we draw the middle number and another number? Actually, no. A sequence must be three consecutive numbers. So if we have [1m, 4m], we cannot form a sequence by drawing one tile. We would need two tiles: 2m and 3m. But wait, the problem allows drawing any tiles, and we can choose which ones. However, the minimal number of draws is 2 in this case? \n\n    # But let's reexamine: \n    #   We have three distinct tiles. To form a triplet, we need three of the same. Since we have none, we need to draw two more of one of the existing tiles (if two are already present, but we don't have two same, so we need to draw two of one tile and one of another? Actually, no. To form a triplet, we can draw three of the same tile, but that would require three draws. Alternatively, if we have two different tiles, we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 9p], we can draw [3m, 4m] to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] is extra, but actually, we only need three consecutive. So we can draw [3m] to form [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have [1m,2m,9p]. We can draw one tile to form [1m,2m,3m]. So why did I think two?\n\n    # Actually, the above loop checks for consecutive numbers in the same suit. In the example [1m,2m,9p], we have two consecutive in the same suit (1m and 2m), so we would have caught that and printed 1.\n\n    # Therefore, the remaining cases are:\n    #   - No two same tiles and no two consecutive in the same suit.\n    #   Then the possibilities are:\n    #       Option 1: Draw two tiles to form a triplet (if two tiles are the same, but we already handled that; so this option isn't available here).\n    #       Option 2: Draw one tile to form a sequence (if there are two consecutive in the same suit, handled above).\n    #       Option 3: Draw two tiles to form a sequence (if there are two tiles in the same suit with a gap of 2, e.g., [1m,3m] -> then drawing 2m completes the sequence [1m,2m,3m]).\n    #       Option 4: Draw three tiles to form a triplet (if all three are different).\n\n    # We already checked for triplet and sequence. Now, check for two tiles in the same suit with a gap of 2.\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums_in_suit = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        if len(nums_in_suit) < 2:\n            continue\n        nums_in_suit_sorted = sorted(set(nums_in_suit))\n        n = len(nums_in_suit_sorted)\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            gap = nums_in_suit_sorted[i+1] - nums_in_suit_sorted[i]\n            if gap == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # Another possibility: two tiles are in different suits but same number. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of that number (but that requires two draws). However, the minimal number of draws required in this case is 2 (since we need three of the same). But note: we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles? Not necessarily.\n\n    # Actually, we haven't considered the case where two tiles have the same number but different suits. Then we cannot form a triplet (because triplet requires same tile) but we can form a sequence? Not directly. However, if we have two tiles of the same number but different suits, then we can draw one more tile of the same number (any suit) to form a triplet? No, triplet requires three identical tiles (same number and same suit). So [1m, 1p, 1s] is not a triplet. Therefore, we need to draw two more tiles of the same suit and same number to form a triplet, but wait, we can draw any tiles. Actually, to form a triplet, we need three tiles of the same kind (same number and same suit). So if we have [1m, 1p, 2s], then to form a triplet of 1m, we need two more 1m. Similarly for 1p. So the minimal draws in this case would be 2 (draw two 1m, for example).\n\n    # But note: we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. For example, if we have [1m, 1p, 2s], we could draw one tile to form a sequence? Not easily because sequences require same suit and consecutive numbers. We have two 1's in different suits and a 2 in a different suit. We can draw a 3m and a 2m to form a sequence [2m,3m] (but that's two tiles, but we need three). Alternatively, we can draw a 3m and a 1m? That doesn't form a sequence. \n\n    # Actually, the minimal draws in this case is 2 (to form a triplet). However, there might be a better way? \n\n    # Let me reframe: We have three tiles. We can draw up to two tiles to form a mentsu. But if no mentsu is found with the current tiles, we need to see if we can form one with one or two draws.\n\n    # We have already considered:\n    #   - Triplet (0 draws)\n    #   - Sequence (0 draws)\n    #   - Two same tiles (1 draw to complete triplet)\n    #   - Two consecutive in same suit (1 draw to complete sequence)\n    #   - Two tiles in same suit with gap 2 (1 draw to complete sequence)\n\n    # The remaining cases require 2 draws.\n\n    # Therefore, the answer is 2 if none of the above conditions are met.\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Triplet Check**: The code first checks if any tile appears three times. If so, it immediately returns 0 since no draws are needed.\n2. **Sequence Check**: The code then checks for sequences by grouping tiles by suit and verifying if any three tiles form consecutive numbers. If found, it returns 0.\n3. **Two Same Tiles**: If two tiles are identical, only one more is needed to complete a triplet, so the answer is 1.\n4. **Consecutive Numbers**: If two tiles in the same suit are consecutive, one more tile completes the sequence, hence the answer is 1.\n5. **Gap of 2**: If two tiles in the same suit have a gap of 2 (e.g., 1 and 3), one more tile fills the gap, resulting in a sequence, so the answer is 1.\n6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is 2, as two more tiles are needed to either complete a triplet or form a sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",

Then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of the same tile (if two are already present) but we already checked for two same tiles above.\n\n    # What if we don't have any two same tiles and no two consecutive in the same suit?\n    # Then we need to draw either three tiles (to form a triplet) or two tiles (to form a sequence). But note, forming a sequence requires three consecutive numbers, so if we have two non-consecutive tiles in the same suit, we might need two draws to form a sequence (if we draw the middle number and another number? Actually, no. A sequence must be three consecutive numbers. So if we have [1m, 4m], we cannot form a sequence by drawing one tile. We would need two tiles: 2m and 3m. But wait, the problem allows drawing any tiles, and we can choose which ones. However, the minimal number of draws is 2 in this case? \n\n    # But let's reexamine: \n    #   We have three distinct tiles. To form a triplet, we need three of the same. Since we have none, we need to draw two more of one of the existing tiles (if two are already present, but we don't have two same, so we need to draw two of one tile and one of another? Actually, no. To form a triplet, we can draw three of the same tile, but that would require three draws. Alternatively, if we have two different tiles, we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 9p], we can draw [3m, 4m] to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] is extra, but actually, we only need three consecutive. So we can draw [3m] to form [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have [1m,2m,9p]. We can draw one tile to form [1m,2m,3m]. So why did I think two?\n\n    # Actually, the above loop checks for consecutive numbers in the same suit.

Now, check for two tiles in the same suit with a gap of 2.\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums_in_suit = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        if len(nums_in_suit) < 2:\n            continue\n        nums_in_suit_sorted = sorted(set(nums_in_suit))\n        n = len(nums_in_suit_sorted)\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            gap = nums_in_suit_sorted[i+1] - nums_in_suit_sorted[i]\n            if gap == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # Another possibility: two tiles are in different suits but same number. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two more of that number (but that requires two draws). However, the minimal number of draws required in this case is 2 (since we need three of the same). But note: we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles? Not necessarily.\n\n    # Actually, we haven't considered the case where two tiles have the same number but different suits. Then we cannot form a triplet (because triplet requires same tile) but we can form a sequence? Not directly. However, if we have two tiles of the same number but different suits, then we can draw one more tile of the same number (any suit) to form a triplet? No, triplet requires three identical tiles (same number and same suit). So [1m, 1p, 1s] is not a triplet. Therefore, we need to draw two more tiles of the same suit and same number to form a triplet, but wait, we can draw any tiles. Actually, to form a triplet, we need three tiles of the same kind (same number and same suit). So if we have [1m, 1p, 2s], then to form a triplet of 1m, we need two more 1m. Similarly for 1p. So the minimal draws in this case would be 2 (draw two 1m, for example).\n\n    # But note: we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. For example, if we have [1m, 1p, 2s], we could draw one tile to form a sequence? Not easily because sequences require same suit and consecutive numbers. We have two 1's in different suits and a 2 in a different suit. We can draw a 3m and a 2m to form a sequence [2m,3m] (but that's two tiles, but we need three). Alternatively, we can draw a 3m and a 1m? That doesn't form a sequence. \n\n    # Actually, the minimal draws in this case is 2 (to form a triplet). However, there might be a better way? \n\n    # Let me reframe: We have three tiles. We can draw up to two tiles to form a mentsu. But if no mentsu is found with the current tiles, we need to see if we can form one with one or two draws.\n\n    # We have already considered:\n    #   - Triplet (0 draws)\n    #   - Sequence (0 draws)\n    #   - Two same tiles (1 draw to complete triplet)\n    #   - Two consecutive in same suit (1 draw to complete sequence)\n    #   - Two tiles in same suit with gap 2 (1 draw to complete sequence)\n\n    # The remaining cases require 2 draws.\n\n    # Therefore, the answer is 2 if none of the above conditions are met.\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
