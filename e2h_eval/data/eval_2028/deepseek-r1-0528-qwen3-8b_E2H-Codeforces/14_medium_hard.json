    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the trailing zeros are given by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n We know that the exponent of 5 in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n The problem: Given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the sample input m=1 gives output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n Why?\n   Let's compute Z(n) for n from 1 to 10:\n\n   n=1..4: Z(n)=0\n   n=5: Z(5)=1 -> first number with 1 zero.\n   n=6: Z(6)=1\n   n=7: Z(7)=1\n   n=8: Z(8)=1\n   n=9: Z(9)=1\n   n=10: Z(10)=2\n\n So for m=1, the numbers n are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n Observation:\n   The function Z(n) is non-decreasing. But note: it jumps at multiples of 5, then 25, etc.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We cannot iterate n from 1 upwards until we get a very large n because m can be up to 100000.\n\n 2. Instead, we can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m and then check around.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the list of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the example m=1 gives 5 numbers. Actually, the numbers n for which Z(n)=m form consecutive integers? Not necessarily consecutive, but they are consecutive in the sense of the same value of Z(n) until the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) changes the count.\n\n Actually, note that Z(n) is constant over intervals. For example, once we have Z(n)=m, then as long as we don't hit a multiple of 5 (or higher power) that adds more zeros, the value remains m.\n\n But wait: when we go from n to n+1, the trailing zeros only increase when n+1 is divisible by a power of 5. So the set of n with Z(n)=m is an interval? \n\n Example: m=2\n   n=10: Z(10)=2\n   n=11: Z(11)=2\n   n=12: Z(12)=2\n   n=13: Z(13)=2\n   n=14: Z(14)=2\n   n=15: Z(15)=3\n\n So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\n In general, for a given m, we are looking for the minimal n0 such that Z(n0)=m, and then the maximal n1 such that Z(n1)=m.\n\n However, note: sometimes the same m might not appear? Actually, the problem states m between 1 and 100000, so we must consider that.\n\n But note: the function Z(n) increases by more than one sometimes. For example, when n=24: Z(24)=4, n=25: Z(25)=6. So there is no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n Therefore, for some m, there might be no n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n How to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m?\n\n We can use binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n Similarly, we can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1, then the numbers n for which Z(n)=m are from [start, start + length - 1] if we found that the next jump is at start + length.\n\n Alternatively, we can find:\n   Let L(m) = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Let L(m+1) = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n Then, the numbers n with Z(n)=m are from L(m) to L(m+1)-1, provided that Z(L(m)) == m and Z(L(m+1)-1)==m.\n\n But note: what if there is a gap? Actually, the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued. The set of n with Z(n)=m is the set of n such that:\n   Z(n) = m and Z(n+1) = m until we hit the next jump.\n\n However, we must account for gaps: if there is no n with Z(n)=m, then we should output 0.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Call this L.\n\n   Step 2: Check if Z(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n   But wait: if we define L as the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, then if Z(L) != m, then actually we have skipped m? Actually, no: because the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer, if Z(L) > m then there was a jump from below m to above m without having m. Then we output nothing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Let L = smallest n with Z(n) >= m\n      Let R = smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, the numbers n with Z(n)=m are from L to R-1, provided that Z(L)==m.\n\n   But if Z(L) != m, then actually we didn't have any n with Z(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: because Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer, we have:\n\n        Z(L) >= m and Z(L-1) < m.\n\n        Also, if Z(L) > m, then there is no n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n   So:\n\n        If Z(L) != m, then output 0.\n\n        Otherwise, the n's are from L to R-1.\n\n   But wait: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\n   However, the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   Example: m=1.\n\n        Find L: smallest n such that Z(n)>=1 -> n=5 (Z(5)=1)\n        Find R: smallest n such that Z(n)>=2 -> n=10 (Z(10)=2)\n\n        Then n from 5 to 9 (which is 5,6,7,8,9) -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Example: m=2.\n\n        L: smallest n with Z(n)>=2 -> n=10 (Z(10)=2)\n        R: smallest n with Z(n)>=3 -> n=15 (Z(15)=3)\n\n        Then n from 10 to 14.\n\n   Example: m=5.\n\n        We know that n=25 gives Z(25)=6, so there is no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n        How to compute Z(24): floor(24/5)+floor(24/25)=4+0=4.\n        Then L for m=5: smallest n with Z(n)>=5. \n            n=20: Z(20)=4 -> not enough.\n            n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so L=25.\n\n        Then Z(25)=6 !=5 -> so no n.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        Define a function Z(n) that computes the exponent of 5 in n!.\n\n        Then:\n\n          low = 0, high = some upper bound (since m<=100000, we can set high to 5*m or something, but note: the formula for Z(n) is roughly n/4, so we need n such that Z(n) >= m. We can set high = 5 * m (but sometimes we need higher because of powers, but 5*m is a safe bound? Actually, the maximum n we need to consider for m=100000: \n                Z(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4 (geometric series with ratio 1/5) so n >= 4*m. We can set high = 5*m, but to be safe, we can set high = 5 * m * 2, but let's see: \n\n                Actually, we can use a while loop to extend until we exceed m, but we are doing binary search.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n          Step 2: Find R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n          Step 3: If Z(L) == m, then the numbers are from L to R-1 (inclusive). The count is R - L.\n\n          Step 4: Otherwise, output 0.\n\n        However, note: what if m is too large? For example, if m is 100000, then we need to compute Z(n) for n up to maybe 500000 (if we set high=5*m=500000, then Z(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... which is about 100000 + 20000 + ... so definitely >=100000). \n\n        But we must set an upper bound for the binary search. Since Z(n) ~ n/4 (actually, the sum is less than n/4 because 1/5+1/25+... = 1/4), so n must be at least about 4*m. We can set high to, say, 5*m (because 5*m /5 + 5*m/25 + ... is at least m, so 5*m is safe).\n\n        However, sometimes we might need even higher? Consider: if m is large, then n needs to be around 4*m. But our binary search will work.\n\n        Implementation of Z(n):\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n\n        Then, we need to do two binary searches:\n\n            low = 0, high = 5*m  (since we know that Z(5*m) is at least m, because 5*m//5 + 5*m//25 + ... >= m)\n\n            Actually, we can set high = 5*m + 100  (to be safe) but we can also use:\n\n                We want to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n                We can set high = 5 * m * 5  (overkill) but m is 100000, so 5*m is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem says m up to 100000. Then 5*m = 500000, and computing Z(500000) is:\n\n            500000//5 = 100000\n            500000//25 = 20000\n            500000//125 = 4000\n            500000//625 = 800\n            500000//3125 = 160\n            500000//15625 = 32\n            500000//78125 = 6\n            500000//390625 = 1\n\n            Sum = 100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+6+1 = 124999, which is way above m=100000.\n\n        So the binary search for L (for m=100000) would set high initially to 500000, then we can do:\n\n            low = 0, high = 500000\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if Z(mid) >= m:\n                    high = mid\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n\n            Then L = low.\n\n        Then we do the same for m+1.\n\n        Then, if Z(L) == m, then the answer is the list of numbers from L to R-1 (where R is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1).\n\n        But note: the range [L, R-1] might be very large? Actually, the length of the interval is (R - L). And we are to output these numbers? \n\n        The problem says: First print k (the number of values) then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n        However, k can be up to 5 (as in the example) but sometimes more? Actually, the maximum length of consecutive n with the same trailing zeros is 4 (from n to n+4) because at n+5, the trailing zeros increase (unless n+5 is a multiple of 25 or higher, then it increases by more). \n\n        Actually, the length is the distance between the next jump. The next jump happens when n becomes a multiple of 5, then 25, then 125, etc.\n\n        But note: the jump size is the increase in Z(n) from n to n+1. It is the exponent of 5 in (n+1). But we are looking for the next n where Z(n) increases.\n\n        However, we are using R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Then the last n with Z(n)=m is R-1.\n\n        The total numbers is R-L.\n\n        Example: m=1 -> L=5, R=10, so count=5 (from 5 to 9).\n\n        Example: m=2 -> L=10, R=15, count=5.\n\n        Example: m=3 -> L=15, R=20, count=5.\n\n        Example: m=4 -> L=20, R=25, count=5.\n\n        Example: m=5 -> no solution.\n\n        Example: m=6 -> L=25, R=30? \n            Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7 -> so R=30, count=5.\n\n        So it seems that for every m that appears, the consecutive numbers are 5.\n\n        But wait, what about m=0? (not required) but for m=0, we would have n from 0 to 4? But the problem says positive integers, so n>=1, and Z(1)=0, so n=1,2,3,4 -> 4 numbers.\n\n        However, the problem states m>=1.\n\n        Now, why is the consecutive length always 5? Because the next jump is at the next multiple of 5, and between two consecutive multiples of 5, there are 4 numbers. But wait, from 5 to 9: 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers, because 5 is included and then 9 is the last one before the next jump (at 10).\n\n        Actually, the consecutive block for a fixed m is from the smallest n (which is a multiple of 5, or not?) to the n just before the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase.\n\n        But note: the increase happens at multiples of 5. However, sometimes the increase is more than one (like at 25, which is a multiple of 25). Then the consecutive block for m=6 (which is the value at 25) is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers). Then at 30, Z(30)=7 (because 30//5=6, 30//25=1 -> 6+1=7).\n\n        Actually, the next jump after 25 is at 30 (which is the next multiple of 5, but note: 26,27,28,29 don't add any factor of 5, so Z(n) remains 6 until 30.\n\n        However, what about 50? At 50, we have two factors of 5 (from 50 itself and the previous ones) so Z(50) = 50//5 + 50//25 + 50//125 = 10+2+0=12, and Z(49)=49//5+49//25=9+1=10, so the block for m=11 would be from 55? Actually, let's compute:\n\n        But note: we are finding the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. The next jump might be more than 5 steps away if we hit a higher power.\n\n        Actually, the length of the interval for a given m is the distance from the smallest n with Z(n)=m to the next n where Z(n) becomes m+1 (or more). The next n where Z(n) increases is the next multiple of 5 (unless there is a higher power that causes an increase earlier). \n\n        However, note: the function Z(n) is constant on intervals between multiples of 5. But when we cross a multiple of 25, then at that point Z(n) increases by 2 (if the multiple is 25) or more. So the next jump might be at the next multiple of 5, but the amount of increase might be more than 1.\n\n        But the definition of R is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. So we don't care about the exact jump, we just care that we stop at the first n where Z(n) becomes at least m+1.\n\n        Therefore, the consecutive numbers for a fixed m (if they exist) are always 5? \n\n        Actually, let's check m=11:\n\n            We know that Z(49)=10, Z(50)=12. So there is no n with Z(n)=11.\n\n            Then how do we compute the consecutive numbers for m=12?\n\n            L = smallest n with Z(n)>=12 -> n=50 (Z(50)=12)\n            R = smallest n with Z(n)>=13 -> ?\n\n            We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n)>=13.\n\n            Z(50)=12, Z(51)=12, Z(52)=12, Z(53)=12, Z(54)=12, Z(55)=13 (because 55//5=11, 55//25=2, 55//125=0 -> 13)\n\n            So R=55.\n\n            Then the consecutive numbers for m=12 are from 50 to 54 -> 5 numbers.\n\n        So the length is always 5? \n\n        Why? Because the next jump (where Z(n) increases) is at the next multiple of 5, unless we hit a multiple of 25, then the jump is bigger, but the next jump (the next time Z(n) increases) is still the next multiple of 5. Actually, no: the next jump is the next time we multiply by 5, which is 5 steps away? \n\n        Actually, the function Z(n) increases at every multiple of 5, but sometimes by more than one. However, the next jump (the next n where Z(n) > Z(n-1)) is always a multiple of 5. And the distance from one multiple of 5 to the next is 5. But note: the starting point for a fixed m is the smallest n (which might not be a multiple of 5) such that Z(n)=m. \n\n        However, note: Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. So the value of Z(n) is constant from n=k to n=k+4 (if k is a multiple of 5, then from k to k+4, then at k+5 it increases). \n\n        But wait: what if k is not a multiple of 5? Then the smallest n such that Z(n)=m might be in the middle of the block? \n\n        Actually, no: because Z(n) is constant on the interval [k, k+4] (if k is a multiple of 5, then the next change is at k+5). \n\n        However, let's check:\n\n            n=20: Z(20)=4, then n=21,22,23,24: still 4. Then n=25: Z(25)=6.\n\n            So the value of Z(n) is constant from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). \n\n            Now, what if m=4? Then the smallest n is 20. Then the next jump is at 25, so the numbers are 20,21,22,23,24 -> 5 numbers.\n\n        Therefore, the consecutive numbers for a given m (if they exist) are always 5.\n\n        But wait: what if the smallest n is not the start of a block? Actually, the entire block from the start of the block (the last multiple of 5 that caused an increase) to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) is 5 numbers.\n\n        However, the smallest n with Z(n)=m is the first n in the block. The block starts at a multiple of 5 (say k) and goes until k+4.\n\n        But note: the value of Z(n) is the same for n in [k, k+4]. So the smallest n with Z(n)=m must be the beginning of a block (a multiple of 5) because if you start at a non-multiple of 5, then the value Z(n) is the same as Z(k) (the last multiple of 5) and the next jump is at k+5.\n\n        Actually, the smallest n with Z(n)=m is the smallest multiple of 5 such that Z(n) becomes m (or more precisely, the smallest n such that Z(n)=m, which is the same as the smallest multiple of 5 that causes the cumulative count to reach m, or the start of the block).\n\n        But wait: consider m=1. The smallest n is 5 (a multiple of 5). Then the next block starts at 10.\n\n        Consider m=2. The smallest n is 10 (a multiple of 5). Then the next block starts at 15.\n\n        But wait: what if m=0? Then the smallest n is 0? Or we don't consider 0. But the problem says positive integers, so n>=1. Then for m=0, the smallest n is 1, which is not a multiple of 5. Then the block for m=0 would be from 1 to 4 (5 numbers again). \n\n        However, m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the conclusion: if there exists an n with Z(n)=m, then there are exactly 5 such n's, except possibly for the last block (if m is the maximum value we can get with n being positive)? \n\n        Actually, the last block for a given m might be incomplete? \n\n        But note: the next block starts at the next multiple of 5. The current block ends at a multiple of 5 minus 1. Then the next block starts at the next multiple of 5. \n\n        However, our method uses the next jump (smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1). This jump is the next multiple of 5 (or a multiple of 25, but that just means the jump is bigger, but we are only concerned with the first n that reaches m+1). \n\n        Therefore, the length is always 5.\n\n        But wait: what if m is very large, such that the next jump is more than 5 steps away? \n\n        Actually, the next jump is defined as the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. This n might be a multiple of 5, but note: the function Z(n) is constant between multiples of 5. Therefore, the next jump is at the next multiple of 5 (the smallest multiple of 5 that causes Z(n) to become at least m+1). \n\n        However, the increase from n to n+1 (when n+1 is a multiple of 5) is by the exponent of 5 in (n+1). But we don't need to know the exact jump, we just need to know the next n where Z(n) increases.\n\n        And the next increase is at the next multiple of 5. Therefore, the block for m is from L to L+4 (if L is the start of the block, i.e., a multiple of 5). \n\n        But wait: what if L is not a multiple of 5? Then the value of Z(L) would be the same as Z(L-1) (if L is not a multiple of 5, then the last multiple of 5 was L-5, etc.). \n\n        Actually, the function Z(n) is constant for n in [k, k+4] (where k is a multiple of 5). Therefore, the smallest n with Z(n)=m must be a multiple of 5 (because if you have a non-multiple, then the value is the same as the last multiple of 5, and the last multiple of 5 already had that value). \n\n        However, consider: the smallest n with Z(n)=m is the smallest n such that the cumulative count (from 1 to n) of factors of 5 is m. This n is the smallest n for which the cumulative count reaches m. \n\n        Example: m=1. The cumulative count reaches 1 at n=5. And 5 is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Example: m=2. The cumulative count reaches 2 at n=10. 10 is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Example: m=3. The cumulative count reaches 3 at n=15. 15 is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Example: m=4. The cumulative count reaches 4 at n=20. 20 is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Example: m=6. The cumulative count reaches 6 at n=25. 25 is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Therefore, the smallest n (L) is always a multiple of 5.\n\n        Then, the next jump (R) is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. This n is the next multiple of 5 (because the value Z(n) increases only at multiples of 5). \n\n        But wait: what if the next multiple of 5 is not enough to get m+1? Then we have to go to the next one? \n\n        Example: m=5 (which does not exist). Then L=25 (because Z(25)=6>=5). Then we look for R: the smallest n such that Z(n)>=6 -> 25. Then Z(25)=6 !=5, so we output 0.\n\n        Example: m=6. Then L=25 (Z(25)=6>=6). Then R: smallest n such that Z(n)>=7 -> 30 (because Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7). Then the numbers are from 25 to 29 (5 numbers).\n\n        Therefore, the length is always 5 if the set is non-empty.\n\n        But wait: what if the next jump is within the same multiple of 5? No, because the next jump is defined by the next multiple of 5.\n\n        However, note: the next jump might be at a higher power (like 25) and then the jump is more than one. But the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1 is the first n where the cumulative count reaches m+1, which is the next multiple of 5 (if the next multiple of 5 gives a jump of 1) or later if the next multiple of 5 doesn't give enough? \n\n        Actually, the cumulative count increases by the exponent of 5 in n. When n is a multiple of 5, the increase is at least 1 (if n is divisible by 5 but not 25, then exponent is 1; if divisible by 25, then exponent is 2, etc.). \n\n        But note: we are looking for the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. The next jump (the next multiple of 5) might not be enough to get from m to m+1 (if the jump is 2, then we jump from m to m+2, so we need to check if m+1 is achieved? Actually, no: if we jump from m to m+2, then we have achieved m+1 at the same n (because Z(n) becomes m+2, which is >=m+1). \n\n        But in that case, the next jump is the same multiple of 5 that gives the jump of 2. \n\n        However, the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1 is the same n that gives Z(n)=m+2 (if the jump is 2). Then the block for m is from L to n-1 (which is the same multiple of 5 minus 1). And the length is still 5.\n\n        Example: m=5 (which doesn't exist). Then we look for m=6: the smallest n with Z(n)>=6 is 25, and then the block for m=5 doesn't exist. But for m=6, the block is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers).\n\n        Therefore, the answer for a given m is either 0 or 5.\n\n        But wait: what about m=0? (not required) and m=0 would be 5 numbers (from 1 to 4) if we allowed, but the problem says m>=1.\n\n        However, wait: what if m is 100000? \n\n            We have to find the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100000.\n\n            Then the next smallest n such that Z(n)>=100001.\n\n            Then if Z(L)==100000, then we output 5 numbers: L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4.\n\n        But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases by an integer amount (at least 1) at multiples of 5. Therefore, if m is present, then the next value is m+1 (if the jump is 1) or more (if the jump is more). \n\n        However, the block for m is always 5 numbers.\n\n        But wait: what if the next jump is more than one? Then the block for m is still 5 numbers because the next jump is at the next multiple of 5 (which is L+5). \n\n        Example: m=4 (so L=20). Then Z(20)=4. Then the next jump is at 25, which gives Z(25)=6. Then the numbers with Z(n)=4 are from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). Even though at 25 we jump to 6, we still have 20,21,22,23,24.\n\n        So the length is always 5.\n\n        Therefore, we can simplify:\n\n          Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n          Step 2: If Z(L) != m, then output 0.\n          Step 3: Else, output 5 and the numbers L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4.\n\n        However, wait: what if the next jump is not at L+5? \n\n        Actually, the next jump (the next n where Z(n) increases) is the next multiple of 5. And the next multiple of 5 is L+5 (because L is a multiple of 5). \n\n        But note: L is a multiple of 5 (as we saw). Then the next multiple of 5 is L+5, and then Z(L+5) = Z(L) + (exponent of 5 in (L+5)). \n\n        The condition for the next block is that Z(L+5) >= m+1. But we don't require that the next block has m+1, we only require that from L to L+4, Z(n)=m.\n\n        However, we know that Z(L)=m and Z(L+1)=m, ..., Z(L+4)=m, and Z(L+5)=m + (exponent of 5 in (L+5)).\n\n        Therefore, the block for m is always 5 numbers.\n\n        But wait: what if the next jump (at L+5) is more than one? Then the value of Z(L+5) is m + (exponent of 5 in (L+5)), which is at least m+1. But we don't care, because we stop at L+4 (which is still m).\n\n        However, the problem is: we need to output the numbers from L to L+4.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", and L is positive (since m>=1, then L>=5).\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          Read m.\n\n          If m==0: (but m>=1, so skip)\n\n          Define Z(n) function.\n\n          Use binary search to find L (smallest n such that Z(n)>=m).\n\n          Then check if Z(L)==m. If not, output 0.\n\n          Else, output:\n               5\n               L L+1 L+2 L+3 L+4\n\n        However, note: there is a possibility that the set of n with Z(n)=m might be more than 5? \n\n        Let me think: the function Z(n) is constant on intervals of 5 numbers. Therefore, the set of n with Z(n)=m is an interval of consecutive integers of length 5, if it exists.\n\n        But wait: what if m is the maximum value? Then the next block (L+5) would have Z(L+5)=m+something, but we only require that Z(L)=m and then the next block starts at L+5. However, the problem does not specify an upper bound on n. But note: our binary search for L is defined for n up to 5*m (or more). \n\n        However, the problem says m from 1 to 100000. And we are setting high = 5*m (or 5*m*2) for the binary search. \n\n        But note: the block for m is always 5 numbers, so we can output them.\n\n        However, wait: what if m is very large, such that the next jump (at L+5) is beyond the range we computed? \n\n        Actually, our binary search for L and for m+1 is independent. We set high to 5*m (which is 500000 for m=100000) and then we compute L and then R. But if m=100000, then L is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100000. Then the next jump (R) is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100001. \n\n        Then we output the numbers from L to R-1. But note: the length is R-L, which is 5 (if Z(L)==100000). \n\n        However, we don't know if the block for m=100000 is complete? \n\n        Actually, the block for m=100000 is from L to L+4. And then the next jump is at L+5 (if L is a multiple of 5). \n\n        But wait, we defined R as the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100001. And since Z(L+5) = Z(L) + (exponent of 5 in (L+5)), and if Z(L)=100000, then Z(L+5) is 100000 plus the exponent of 5 in (L+5). \n\n        The exponent of 5 in (L+5) is at least 1 (because L+5 is a multiple of 5). So Z(L+5) >= 100001. Therefore, R = L+5.\n\n        Then the block is [L, L+4] (5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is equivalent to the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term represents the number of times \\( n \\) can be divided by powers of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( Z(R) \\geq m + 1 \\). If \\( Z(L) \\) equals \\( m \\), then all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial. The count of such integers is \\( R - L \\).\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( Z(L) > m \\)), the answer is 0. Otherwise, the solution outputs the count and the list of integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n\n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    L = low\n    if trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        R = L\n        low_r = 0\n        high_r = 5 * m\n        while low_r < high_r:\n            mid_r = (low_r + high_r) // 2\n            if trailing_zeros(mid_r) >= m + 1:\n                high_r = mid_r\n            else:\n                low_r = mid_r + 1\n        R = low_r\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which is expected to be a single integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Trailing Zeroes Calculation**: The function `trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5.\n3. **Binary Search for Lower Bound \\( L \\)**: The binary search finds the smallest \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\).
