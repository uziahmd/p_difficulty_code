    "thought": "\n We are going to remove exactly one element. The instability is defined as max - min.\n Removing an element can only change the current min or max (or both) if we remove the current minimum or maximum.\n\n However, note that the array might have duplicates. The idea is to consider:\n  Option 1: Remove the smallest element. Then the new min is the next smallest (which is the original second smallest) and the max remains the same.\n  Option 2: Remove the largest element. Then the new max is the next largest (original second largest) and the min remains the same.\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability doesn't change.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be achieved by either:\n   candidate1 = max(a) - a[1]   [if we remove the first occurrence of the min? Actually, we need the second smallest]\n   candidate2 = a[-2] - min(a)   [if we remove the first occurrence of the max? Actually, we need the second largest]\n\n However, note: the array might have duplicates. We should consider the entire sorted array.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n and the list of integers.\n  2. Sort the array.\n  3. Consider removing one occurrence of the smallest element. Then the new instability is (max of the remaining) - (second smallest).\n        -> candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n  4. Consider removing one occurrence of the largest element. Then the new instability is (second largest) - (min of the remaining)\n        -> candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n\n  But wait: what if there are multiple smallest or largest? Actually, removing any one occurrence of the smallest or largest is considered in the above because after sorting, the smallest element is at the beginning and the largest at the end.\n\n  However, note: what if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the same as the original. So we don't need to consider those because they won't lower the instability.\n\n  But wait: what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]? \n      Original instability: 4-1=3.\n      Remove smallest: [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2.\n      Remove largest: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n\n  What about [1, 1, 2, 3]?\n      Original: 3-1=2.\n      Remove one smallest: then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2 (same as original).\n      Remove the other smallest: same result.\n      Remove the largest: [1,1,2] -> 2-1=1. This is better.\n\n  So our candidates must consider that sometimes removing a duplicate smallest might not change the min, but in our sorted array, if we remove the first occurrence of the smallest, the next smallest is the next element. But if there are duplicates, then the next smallest might still be the same as the smallest.\n\n  Actually, we should consider:\n\n  Let the sorted array be `arr`.\n  Possibilities:\n    Option A: Remove the first element (the smallest). Then the new min is arr[1] and the max is arr[-1]. So instability = arr[-1] - arr[1].\n    Option B: Remove the last element (the largest). Then the new max is arr[-2] and the min is arr[0]. So instability = arr[-2] - arr[0].\n\n  However, what if we remove an element that is the smallest but not the first? Actually, the sorted array has the smallest at the beginning. But if we have duplicates, then the smallest might appear multiple times. But note: we are only allowed to remove one element.\n\n  In fact, we don't need to consider removals that are not the smallest or largest because they don't change the overall min or max. However, wait: what if we have an array like [1, 2, 100] and we remove the 2? Then the instability is 100-1 = 99, which is worse than the original. So we only care about removals that change the min or max.\n\n  But note: sometimes removing a non-extreme element might be forced if we cannot remove an extreme? Actually, we are allowed to remove exactly one element arbitrarily. We want to minimize the instability.\n\n  The key observation: the instability of the array is determined by the min and max. Removing an element that is not the current min or max will leave the min and max unchanged. Therefore, the instability remains the same.\n\n  So the only possibilities to reduce the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the instability of the array is determined by its maximum and minimum elements. Removing any element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum will not change the instability. Therefore, the minimal instability must be achieved by either removing the smallest element or the largest element from the array.\n2. **Intuition**: By removing the smallest element, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element in the array, while the maximum remains unchanged. Similarly, removing the largest element makes the new maximum the next largest element, with the minimum unchanged. Thus, the minimal instability is the smaller of these two scenarios.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves sorting the array and then evaluating two scenarios:\n   - Remove the first element (smallest) and compute the instability as the difference between the last element (largest) and the second element (next smallest).\n   - Remove the last element (largest) and compute the instability as the difference between the second last element (next largest) and the first element (smallest).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5\\). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    \n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: Two candidates for minimal instability are computed:\n   - **Candidate1**: The difference between the largest element and the next smallest element (after removing the smallest element).\n   - **Candidate2**: The difference between the next largest element and the smallest element (after removing the largest element).\n4. **Output**: The minimum of the two candidates is printed, representing the smallest possible instability achievable by removing one element from the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting to simplify the identification of key elements and their removal effects on the array's instability.",
