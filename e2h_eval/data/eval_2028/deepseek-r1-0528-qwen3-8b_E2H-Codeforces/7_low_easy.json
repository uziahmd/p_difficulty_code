The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (the number of steps) such that the total number of vertices is n.\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k new vertices. Now total = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 will add k new vertices (so k*k new vertices). Then total becomes 1 + k + k*k.\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k more new vertices. And this step should be done at least once.\n\n However, note that the first step is fixed: we start with one vertex and then connect it to k new ones. Then in the next step, we do the same for each leaf (each of the k vertices) and so on.\n\n So, after t steps (with t>=1 meaning the step is done at least once), the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least once\", so t must be at least 1. However, note that the example smallest snowflake for k=4 is given, which has 1 + 4 + 4*3? Actually, wait: let's break down the example.\n\n Actually, the example says: the initial vertex is connected to k new ones -> then each vertex that is connected to only one other (the k leaves) are connected to k new ones. So:\n\n   Step0: 1 node.\n   Step1: 1 + k nodes.\n   Step2: 1 + k + k*k nodes.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n But wait: the first expansion is the initial one (from the center) and then we do at least one more expansion? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\n   Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k more new vertices (this step should be done at least once).\n\n So the process:\n\n   Start: 1 node (step0)\n   Step1: add k nodes -> total 1+k. Now the initial node has degree k, and each of the k nodes has degree 1 (leaf).\n   Then, we do the second step (because the condition requires at least one expansion beyond the first?): but note the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves must happen at least once. So the first expansion is the initial one, then we have at least one expansion from the leaves.\n\n Actually, let me read again: \n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). \n   Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n So the process has two parts:\n\n   Part1: The initial expansion (from the center) is mandatory and gives k new vertices.\n\n   Part2: Then, the expansion from the leaves must be done at least once. But note: after the first expansion, we have k leaves. Then we expand each leaf by k, so we get k*k new vertices.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we stop after two expansions. We can do more than one expansion (multiple steps). But the problem says \"at least once\" for the second part, meaning we must do at least one expansion from the leaves.\n\n Therefore, the minimum number of steps is 2 (initial expansion and one expansion from leaves). However, note: the problem does not specify that we have to stop at two. We can do t steps (t>=2) or even just the initial expansion and one expansion (t=2) or more.\n\n But wait: what if we consider t=1? Then we have only the initial expansion. The problem says the second step (expanding the leaves) must be done at least once. So t=1 is not allowed.\n\n Alternatively, let me reexamine the problem statement: It says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the process:\n\n   Step",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single central vertex and expanding outward in each subsequent layer. Each vertex in the current layer connects to \\( k \\) new vertices in the next layer, where \\( k > 1 \\). The construction must include at least two layers (the initial center and one expansion from the leaves).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after \\( t \\) expansions (including the initial expansion) is given by the geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\). This sum must equal \\( n \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 1 \\). However, note that the problem requires at least one expansion from the leaves, meaning \\( t \\geq 2 \\) (initial expansion plus at least one more layer).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( n \\) to be expressible as the sum of a geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\) with \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 2 \\), we can derive that \\( n \\) must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, \\( n \\) must be at least \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\) for some \\( k \\). \n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: The sum of the geometric series is \\( \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} = n \\). Rearranging, we get \\( k^{t+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\). Since \\( k \\) and \\( t \\) are integers, we can check for possible values of \\( k \\) such that \\( k^2 \\leq n \\) (because \\( t \\geq 2 \\) implies at least three terms: \\( 1, k, k^2 \\)).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**: Given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we need an efficient way to check for the existence of such \\( k \\). We iterate over possible \\( k \\) values from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt[3]{n} \\) (since \\( k^3 \\leq n \\)), compute the required sum for \\( t=2 \\) (i.e., \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\)), and check if it matches \\( n \\). Additionally, we consider higher powers of \\( k \\) to see if \\( n \\) fits a longer geometric series.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: \n   - If \\( n < 7 \\), it's impossible to form a valid snowflake (since the smallest valid snowflake has \\( 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7 \\) vertices).\n   - For larger \\( n \\), we check all possible \\( k \\) values up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) and verify if \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with \\( k \\) and at least three terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(t):\n        n = int(data[1+i])\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        k = 2\n        while k * k <= n:\n            if k == 2:\n                total = 1 + k + k*k\n                if total == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    k += 1\n                    continue\n                    \n            s = 1 + k\n            term = k\n            while term <= n:\n                s += term\n                if s == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                term *= k\n                if term > n:\n                    break\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n            k += 1\n\n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: For each test case, if \\( n \\) is less than 7, it immediately outputs \"NO\" since no valid snowflake can be formed with fewer than 7 vertices.\n3. **Finding Valid \\( k \\)**:\n   - The loop starts from \\( k = 2 \\) and checks each \\( k \\) until \\( k^2 \\) exceeds \\( n \\).\n   - For each \\( k \\), it calculates the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots \\) until the sum either matches \\( n \\) or exceeds it.\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid \\( k \\) is found during the checks, \"YES\" is appended to the results; otherwise, \"NO\" is appended.\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible values of \\( k \\) by leveraging the geometric series properties and early termination once a match is found, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
