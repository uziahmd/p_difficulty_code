The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round-by-round.\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are cyclic. Let:\n   m = len(A), k = len(B)\n Then, the i-th round (0-indexed) uses:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n We need to count the rounds where:\n   - Nikephoros loses: when (a_i, b_i) is one of: ('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')\n   - Polycarpus loses: when (b_i, a_i) is one of: ('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S') [which is equivalent to: \n        (a_i, b_i) being one of: ('P','R'), ('R','S'), ('S','P'))\n\n But note: the same outcome can be determined by comparing the two.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each pair (x, y) whether it's a win for the first (then second wins) or draw.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute a base period for the two sequences. The combined sequence repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? \n    However, note that the two sequences have different lengths. But we don't need to go to LCM because the total rounds n might be large.\n\n 2. Instead, we can consider that the entire game is periodic with period T = LCM(m, k). But note: n can be up to 2e9 and m,k up to 1000, so LCM(m,k) could be as large as about 1e6 (if m and k are coprime then LCM(m,k)=m*k, which is 1e6 at worst). However, we cannot iterate over 1e6 * (number of periods) if we use LCM because n / T could be up to 2e9 / (1e6) = 2000, and then 2000 * 1e6 = 2e9 which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline? \n\n 3. Alternatively, we can precompute one period (of length T = LCM(m,k)) and then multiply by the number of full periods and then add the remainder.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to compute the entire LCM period, because the two sequences are independent and we can break down the rounds by considering the indices modulo m and modulo k.\n\n 4. Another approach: we can iterate over the cycles of A and B separately? Actually, we can consider the rounds as pairs (i mod m, j mod k) and the total rounds is n. But note: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1, so the pair (i mod m, i mod k) is not independent. \n\n 5. We can use the following: \n    Let f(i) = (i mod m, i mod k). The sequence of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i=0 to n-1 is periodic with period T = LCM(m, k). So we can compute the total losses in one period and then multiply by the number of full periods, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\n 6. How to compute the losses in one period?\n\n    Let T = LCM(m, k). Then we can iterate i from 0 to T-1, but T can be as large as 1000*1000 (if m and k are coprime) which is 1e6. Then we do this for each period, but the number of periods is n // T, and n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over 1e6 * (n // T) because n//T might be 2000 and 2000 * 1e6 = 2e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n 7. We need a better way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can count the total losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus by considering the entire sequence without iterating each round.\n\n For a fixed round i, let:\n   a = A[i % m]\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n We need to check the rules:\n\n Define:\n   lose_nike = (a, b) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]\n   lose_poly = (b, a) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]   [which is equivalent to: (a,b) in [('P','R'), ('R','S'), ('S','P')] ]\n\n However, note that we can also think: \n   In a round, if the outcome is not a draw, then one of them loses. So the total losses for both should sum to (n - number_of_draws). But we want individual counts.\n\n Let's define:\n   loss_n = 0\n   loss_p = 0\n\n We can precompute two arrays: \n   For each position i in A (from 0 to m-1) and each position j in B (from 0 to k-1), determine:\n        outcome = (A[i], B[j])\n        if outcome is a win for Nikephoros, then no loss for him, but Polycarpus gets a loss?\n        Actually, the rules: \n            Rock beats Scissors -> (R, S): Nikephoros wins (so he doesn't get a spot, but Polycarpus does).\n            So we can define:\n\n        outcome mapping:\n            (R, R): draw\n            (R, P): Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses) -> loss_n += 1\n            (R, S): Nikephoros wins -> loss_p += 1\n\n            (S, R): Nikephoros wins (because S loses to R? No: wait, Rock beats Scissors -> so if Nikephoros shows S and Polycarpus shows R, then S loses to R? Actually, no: the rule says \"Rock beats Scissors\", meaning if you show Rock and opponent shows Scissors, you win. So if Nikephoros shows S (scissors) and Polycarpus shows R (rock), then according to the rule: Rock beats Scissors -> so Polycarpus wins. Thus, that round gives a loss to Nikephoros.\n\n        Let me re-map:\n\n        Conditions for Nikephoros losing (i.e., Polycarpus wins):\n            (a, b) = (R, P) -> because then Polycarpus shows Paper (beats Rock)\n                     (S, R) -> because then Polycarpus shows Rock (beats Scissors)\n                     (P, S) -> because then Polycarpus shows Scissors (beats Paper)\n\n        Conditions for Polycarpus losing (i.e., Nikephoros wins):\n            (a, b) = (P, R) -> because then Nikephoros shows Paper (beats Rock)\n                     (R, S) -> because then Nikephoros shows Rock (beats Scissors)\n                     (S, P) -> because then Nikephoros shows Scissors (beats Paper)\n\n        And draws: (a, b) in [('R','R'), ('S','S'), ('P','P')]\n\n 8. Now, how to count without iterating each round? \n\n We can consider the entire game as:\n\n   For each index i (0 <= i < n), we have:\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n   We wish to count the number of i such that (a, b) is in the set for loss_n and similarly for loss_p.\n\n 9. We can use the idea of breaking the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different periods. The combined state (i mod m, i mod k) has period T = LCM(m, k). But n can be very large (up to 2e9) and T can be up to 1000000 (which is acceptable for precomputation for one period, but then we have to do it for the entire n).\n\n 10. Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)\n\n   Step 2: Precompute the losses for one period of T rounds.\n\n        loss_n_period = 0\n        loss_p_period = 0\n\n        We can iterate i from 0 to T-1, but note that T can be up to 1000000 (if m and k are coprime) and then we do that for each period? Actually, we only need to compute the losses for one period (the period T) and then multiply by the number of full periods, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\n   Step 3: Let full_periods = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n   Step 4: Then total_loss_n = full_periods * loss_n_period + (losses from the first 'remainder' rounds)\n            Similarly for loss_p.\n\n   But how to compute the losses for the first 'remainder' rounds? We can iterate over the first 'remainder' rounds? That would be O(remainder) which can be up to T (which is 1e6) and that is acceptable because we already computed the full period and we only do the remainder once.\n\n 11. However, note that T = LCM(m,k) and the state (i mod m, i mod k) for i in [0, T-1] covers all pairs (x, y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] exactly once. Therefore, we can precompute:\n\n        For x in range(m):\n            For y in range(k):\n                Check the outcome for (A[x], B[y])\n\n        Then the total losses in one period is the sum over x,y of indicator(loss_n) and similarly for loss_p.\n\n        But note: the rounds are in order, and the state (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 is not the same as iterating over all (x,y) arbitrarily. Actually, the sequence of states is:\n\n            (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ... (m-1,0), (0,1), (1,1), ... (m-1,1), ... until (0, k-1), (1, k-1), ... (m-1, k-1) ?\n\n        But wait, that is not the natural order. The natural order for i is:\n\n            i=0: (0,0)\n            i=1: (1,0)\n            ...\n            i=m-1: (m-1,0)\n            i=m: (0,1)\n            i=m+1: (1,1)\n            ...\n\n        However, the state (x, y) appears exactly once in the period T. Because T is the least common multiple, so the state (x,y) appears when i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since T is the LCM, the system of congruences i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) has a solution for i in [0, T-1]. Therefore, each (x,y) appears exactly once.\n\n        So we can simply iterate over all x from 0 to m-1 and all y from 0 to k-1, and for each (x,y) we know that it appears once in the period T.\n\n        Then:\n            loss_n_period = count of (x,y) in [0, m-1]x[0, k-1] such that (A[x], B[y]) is one of the losing conditions for Nikephoros.\n\n        Similarly, loss_p_period = count of (x,y) such that (A[x], B[y]) is one of the losing conditions for Polycarpus.\n\n        Then, we can compute the total for n rounds as:\n\n            full_periods = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n            But note: the remainder part is the first 'remainder' rounds. However, the first 'remainder' rounds do not cover a full period, so we cannot just use the same counts. We must compute the losses for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\n        How to compute the losses for the first 'remainder' rounds?\n\n        We can iterate i from 0 to remainder-1, and for each i, we compute:\n            x = i % m\n            y = i % k\n            Then check the outcome (A[x], B[y])\n\n        This is O(remainder) and remainder < T (which is <= 1000000). But note: n can be up to 2e9, but the remainder is at most T-1, and T is at most 1000000, so this is acceptable.\n\n 12. However, wait: we already know that the entire period T has T rounds, and the period contains each (x,y) exactly once. Then the first 'remainder' rounds correspond to the states (0,0), (1,0), ... until (remainder-1 mod m, remainder-1 mod k). But these states are the first 'remainder' elements of the sequence.\n\n        We can precompute an array for the entire period T (which is 10^6) and then use the fact that we know the mapping from i (from 0 to T-1) to (x,y) = (i%m, i%k). Then we can store the losses for each i in the period? But that is the same as iterating over i from 0 to T-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute a list of length T (which is 10^6) for the entire period's losses? But then we are storing 10^6 integers, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we have two counts: one for loss_n and one for loss_p. We can precompute:\n\n            losses_n[i] = 1 if (A[i%m], B[i%k]) is a loss for Nikephoros, else 0.\n            losses_p[i] = 1 if (A[i%m], B[i%k]) is a loss for Polycarpus, else 0.\n\n        Then for the full period, we have:\n\n            loss_n_period = sum(losses_n[0:T])\n            loss_p_period = sum(losses_p[0:T])\n\n        And for the remainder, we can do:\n\n            extra_n = 0\n            extra_p = 0\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                x = i % m\n                y = i % k\n                # But note: we don't have stored the losses for each i, but we can compute on the fly.\n\n        However, we can precompute the entire period array for losses_n and losses_p, but that requires T memory and T is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we have to do this for two arrays, so we can do:\n\n            T_val = lcm(m, k)\n            # Create an array for the entire period T_val: we don't need to store the entire array if we are going to use the full period count by the double loop (over x and y) and then for the remainder we iterate.\n\n        Actually, we have two ways to compute the period counts:\n\n        Method 1: Iterate over all x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] (total m*k, which is 1000*1000=1e6) and then for each (x,y) we know that it appears exactly once.\n\n        Then:\n            loss_n_period = 0\n            loss_p_period = 0\n            for x in range(m):\n                for y in range(k):\n                    a_char = A[x]\n                    b_char = B[y]\n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                        loss_n_period += 1\n                    elif (a_char, b_char) in [('P','R'), ('R','S'), ('S','P')]:\n                        loss_p_period += 1\n                    # else: draw, nothing added.\n\n        Then, for the remainder, we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\n        How to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds?\n\n            We can iterate i from 0 to remainder-1, and for each i:\n                x = i % m\n                y = i % k\n                a_char = A[x]\n                b_char = B[y]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                    extra_n += 1\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('P','R'), ('R','S'), ('S','P')]:\n                    extra_p += 1\n\n        Then total_n = full_periods * loss_n_period + extra_n\n        total_p = full_periods * loss_p_period + extra_p\n\n 13. However, note: the above double loop for the full period is O(m*k) which is 1e6, and then the remainder loop is O(remainder) which is <= 1e6. So worst-case we do about 2e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n 14. But wait: is the condition for a draw included? Yes, we don't count draws. And the entire period T (which is LCM(m,k)) is the least common multiple, so we are covering every pair (x,y) exactly once.\n\n 15. However, note: the double loop over x and y does not correspond to the order of the rounds. But the problem is: the round i is defined by (i%m, i%k). And we are counting the outcome for (x,y) regardless of the order? But note, the outcome only depends on the pair (x,y). And since in the entire period T, each (x,y) appears exactly once, then the total losses for the period is independent of the order.\n\n 16. Therefore, we can use the double loop to count the total losses in the period.\n\n 17. Implementation details:\n\n     - We need a function to compute GCD and then LCM.\n\n     - Read n, then string A, then string B.\n\n     - Compute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n     - Compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n     - Then, full_periods = n // T\n          remainder = n % T\n\n     - Count loss_n_period and loss_p_period by iterating over x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1].\n\n     - Then, for the remainder, iterate i from 0 to remainder-1 and update extra_n and extra_p.\n\n 18. Example: the sample input: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Then m=3, k=4, T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then we break 7 rounds into 0 full periods (since 7 < 12) and remainder=7.\n\n        Then we simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also use the double loop for the period (which is 12) and then only the first 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the sample output is (3, 2). \n\n        How does the simulation for 7 rounds work?\n\n        Round 0: (A[0]='R', B[0]='R') -> draw -> (0,0)\n        Round 1: (A[1]='P', B[0]='R') -> Polycarpus loses? Condition for Polycarpus: (b,a) = (R,P) -> which is one of the losing conditions for Polycarpus? Actually, no: the condition for Polycarpus is (b, a) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]. Here (b,a) = ('R','P') -> so yes, so Polycarpus loses. But wait, the condition for Polycarpus is defined by his move being the loser. In round 1: Polycarpus showed 'R' and Nikephoros showed 'P'. According to the rules: \n            Rock vs Paper: Paper beats Rock -> so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So we add one to Polycarpus's loss.\n\n        But in our condition for Polycarpus, we are checking (b, a) = (R, P) which is indeed one of the conditions. So that's correct.\n\n        Round 2: (A[2]='S', B[0]='R') -> (S,R): condition for Polycarpus: (R,S) is not the same as (b,a)=(R,S) -> wait, let me check: \n            Condition for Polycarpus: (b,a) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> (R,S) is not there. \n            Condition for Nikephoros: (a,b) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> ('S','R') is there. So Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Round 3: (A[0]='R', B[1]='S') -> (R,S): condition for Nikephoros: (R,S) is one of the losing conditions? The losing conditions for Nikephoros are: (R,P), (S,R), (P,S). (R,S) is not there. Condition for Polycarpus: (S,R) -> (b,a) = (S,R) is one of the conditions for Polycarpus? The condition for Polycarpus is (b,a) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> (S,R) is the second one. So Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Round 4: (A[1]='P', B[1]='S') -> (P,S): condition for Nikephoros: (P,S) is one of the conditions (third one). So Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Round 5: (A[2]='S', B[1]='S') -> draw.\n\n        Round 6: (A[0]='R', B[2]='P') -> (R,P): condition for Nikephoros: (R,P) is the first condition. So Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Round 7: (A[1]='P', B[3]='P') -> (P,P): draw?

Wait, no: the example says \"P - S.

The number of distinct (x,y) is m*k, and T might be less than m*k? Actually, no: T is the LCM, and the distinct pairs (x,y) is m*k, and the period T must be at least m*k? Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, and T is the LCM. The number of distinct states is LCM(m,k). But note: the state (x,y) is determined by x and y, and the total distinct states is m*k. However, the period T is the smallest positive integer such that for every x, we have (x mod m) and (x mod k) repeat. But note: the state (x,y) appears for x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and there are m*k distinct states. However, the period T is the LCM(m,k) and by definition, the sequence (i mod m, i mod k) has period T and T is the least common multiple. And the set of states is exactly the set of (x,y) for x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and each state appears exactly once per period.\n\n        # But wait, the total distinct states is m*k, and the period T is the LCM(m,k) and the number of states is T, so we must have T = m*k / gcd(m,k) and also the distinct states is m*k, so the period T is the same as the number of distinct states? \n\n        # Actually, the sequence (i mod m, i mod k) for i=0,1,...,T-1 produces T distinct states? Not necessarily. The distinct states are the pairs (x,y) such that x mod m = i mod m and y mod k = i mod k, and the sequence of i runs through residues modulo T. The total distinct states is T, but T = LCM(m,k) and the distinct pairs (x,y) is m*k, so we must have T >= m*k? \n\n        # Let me clarify: the state (i mod m, i mod k) must satisfy the system of congruences. The number of distinct states is the number of solutions i in [0, T-1] for (x,y). Since T is the LCM, the system has a solution for every (x,y) in the grid [0, m-1] x [0, k-1]? Actually, no: the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies when m and k are coprime. In general, the map i -> (i mod m, i mod k) is periodic with period T, and the image is the set of (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? \n\n        # Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition for the system i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) to have a solution is that x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k)). So the distinct states (x,y) that appear are those for which x ≡ y (mod g) where g=gcd(m,k). Then the total distinct states is (m * k) / (g * (m//g)*(k//g))? \n\n        # This complicates things.\n\n        # Let me change our approach: we don't need to use the period T for counting the entire period. We can use the fact that the entire sequence is periodic with period T, but the distinct pairs (x,y) that appear are not necessarily all m*k pairs.\n\n        # However, note: the problem does not require us to use the period T for the entire set of pairs. We are asked for n rounds, and the rounds are played in order: the i-th round uses (i%m, i%k). \n\n        # But the double loop over x and y (from 0 to m-1 and 0 to k-1) counts the outcome for (A[x], B[y]) for every possible (x,y) and then we assume that each (x,y) appears exactly once in the period T. However, the period T is defined by the combined modulus, and the condition for the appearance of a state (x,y) is that there exists i in [0, T-1] such that i mod m = x and i mod k = y, and the necessary and sufficient condition is that x ≡ y (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k)). Therefore, the set of (x,y) that appear is { (x,y) | x in [0, m-1], y in [0, k-1] and x ≡ y (mod g) }.\n\n        # The total number of distinct states is (m//g) * (k//g) * g? Actually, the total distinct states is T = (m * k) // g, but wait: the total distinct states is the number of solutions to the system of congruences, which is T (the period) but that is the length of the period, and the period is T, so the distinct states are T? \n\n        # Actually, the sequence (i mod m, i mod k) for i=0,1,...,T-1 will produce T distinct states, because the next state (T mod m, T mod k) = (0,0) and T is the LCM, so the period is T and the states repeat every T.\n\n        # But note: the set of states is the set of (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g). The total number of such states is (m * k) / g? Actually, the condition is that x mod g = y mod g. The values x can be chosen from m residues, and y from k residues, and the condition is that x mod g = y mod g. The number of pairs (x,y) satisfying that condition is g * (m//g) * (k//g) = (m * k) // g = T. So the distinct states are T, and we have T states.\n\n        # Therefore, we cannot simply iterate over all x and y (from 0 to m-1 and 0 to k-1) because not all (x,y) pairs appear in the period. Only the ones that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g) appear.\n\n        # This means our previous method (iterating over all x and y) is incorrect because it counts more states than actually appear.\n\n        # We must iterate only over the states (x,y) that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g). But note: the state (x,y) appears exactly once in the period T, and T is the LCM(m,k). So the total distinct states is T, and we can generate them by iterating i from 0 to T-1, but that is what we wanted to avoid.\n\n 20. Alternative approach without using the period T for the entire set of pairs:\n\n        We can use the concept of breaking the sequences A and B into their own cycles and then use the inclusion-exclusion for the two cycles.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: m, k <= 1000, so T = LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 = 1000000, which is acceptable to iterate.\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            T_val = LCM(m, k)\n\n            # Precompute the entire period: for i in range(T_val):\n            #   x = i % m\n            #   y = i % k\n            #   a_char = A_str[x]\n            #   b_char = B_str[y]\n            #   key = a_char + b_char\n            #   if key in loss_n_set: loss_n_period += 1\n            #   elif key in loss_p_set: loss_p_period += 1\n\n            Then, full_periods = n // T_val\n            remainder = n % T_val\n\n            Then, for i in range(remainder):\n                x = i % m\n                y = i % k\n                a_char = A_str[x]\n                b_char = B_str[y]\n                key = a_char + b_char\n                if key in loss_n_set:\n                    extra_n += 1\n                elif key in loss_p_set:\n                    extra_p += 1\n\n            total_n = full_periods * loss_n_period + extra_n\n            total_p = full_periods * loss_p_period + extra_p\n\n        This is O(T_val) for the period and O(remainder) for the remainder.\n\n        Since T_val can be up to 1000000, and n can be up to 2e9, then T_val might be 1000000 and n//T_val can be up to 2000, and then we are doing 1000000 * 2000 = 2e9 iterations for the full periods? But wait, we are not iterating the full periods by simulating each round, we are precomputing the period and then multiplying by full_periods. The precomputation for the period is 1000000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Then,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the losses without simulating each round individually, especially since the number of rounds can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes are periodic with a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to compute the losses for one period and then multiply by the number of full periods, plus handle any remaining rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period.\n   - **Period Simulation**: Simulate all rounds within one period to count losses for both players.\n   - **Efficient Counting**: Use the periodic nature to avoid simulating each round individually. For `n` rounds, the total losses are the sum of losses in full periods plus the losses in the remaining rounds.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The simulation of one period takes O(m*k) time, where m and k are the lengths of the sequences (up to 1000 each, making it feasible). The remaining rounds are processed in O(n % T) time, which is also manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T_val = (m * k) // g\n    \n    loss_n_set = {'RP', 'SR', 'PS'}\n    loss_p_set = {'PR', 'RS', 'SP'}\n    \n    loss_n_period = 0\n    loss_p_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T_val):\n        x = i % m\n        y = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[x]\n        b_char = B_str[y]\n        key = a_char + b_char\n        if key in loss_n_set:\n            loss_n_period += 1\n        elif key in loss_p_set:\n            loss_p_period += 1\n            \n    full_periods = n // T_val\n    remainder = n % T_val\n    \n    extra_n = 0\n    extra_p = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        x = i % m\n        y = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[x]\n        b_char = B_str[y]\n        key = a_char + b_char\n        if key in loss_n_set:\n            extra_n += 1\n        elif key in loss_p_set:\n            extra_p += 1\n            \n    total_n = full_periods * loss_n_period + extra_n\n    total_p = full_periods * loss_p_period + extra_p\n    \n    print(f\"{total_n} {total_p}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A_str` and `B_str` used by the players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the period `T_val` of the game outcomes.\n3. **Period Simulation**: For each round in one period (from 0 to `T_val - 1`), the code checks the outcome of the round by comparing the current moves from both sequences. The outcome is determined using predefined sets of losing conditions for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder Handling**: The total losses from full periods are computed by multiplying the losses per period by the number of full periods. The remaining rounds are processed individually to count any additional losses.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially enormous number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
