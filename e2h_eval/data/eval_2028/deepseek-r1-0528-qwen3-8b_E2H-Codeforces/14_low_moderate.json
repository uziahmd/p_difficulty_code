He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the trailing zeros are given by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n We know that the exponent of 5 in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n The problem: Given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the sample input m=1 gives output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n Why?\n   Let's compute Z(n) for n from 1 to 10:\n\n   n=1..4: Z(n)=0\n   n=5: Z(5)=1 -> first n with at least 1 trailing zero is 5.\n   But then, note that from 5 to 9, the number of trailing zeros remains 1. Then at n=10, we get 2.\n\n   So the condition is: we want the numbers n for which the trailing zeros are exactly m.\n\n   However, note that the trailing zeros function Z(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, it increases only at multiples of 5.\n\n   Therefore, if we let:\n        L(m) = the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n        R(m) = the largest n such that Z(n) < m+1   [but wait, we want exactly m]\n\n   Actually, we want to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n   But note: the trailing zeros function stays constant for a range and then jumps.\n\n   Example: \n        m=1: \n          We need n such that Z(n)=1.\n          Z(n)=1 for n in [5, 9] because:\n            n=5 -> 1\n            n=6 -> 1 (because 6! = 720, one zero)\n            n=7 -> 1\n            n=8 -> 1\n            n=9 -> 1\n            n=10 -> 2\n\n        So the set of n is [5,6,7,8,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n   How to find the range for a given m?\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (call this L)\n     2. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1 (call this R_prev) then the numbers with Z(n)=m are in the interval [L, R_prev-1]?\n\n   However, note: \n        We want n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n        Let L(m) = smallest n with Z(n) >= m.\n        Let L(m+1) = smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then, for any n in [L(m), L(m+1)-1], we have Z(n) = m? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, Z(n) is constant on the interval [L(m), L(m+1)-1] but note: it might be that Z(L(m)) = m, and then for n from L(m) to L(m+1)-1, Z(n) remains m until the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: sometimes the jump from m to m+1 is more than one (if we cross a high power of 5). But note: the function Z(n) increases by the exponent of 5 in n. For example, at n=25, Z(25)=6, and Z(24)=4? Actually, let me check:\n\n          Z(24) = floor(24/5)+floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4.\n          Z(25) = floor(25/5)+floor(25/25) = 5+1 = 6.\n\n        So the jump from 24 to 25 is from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\n        This means that for m=5, there is no n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n        Therefore, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is either empty or an interval.\n\n   Approach:\n\n        We can use binary search to find:\n\n          left_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n          right_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, the numbers n with Z(n)=m are those in the interval [left_bound,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The key insight here is understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials, which depends on the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10. Since each trailing zero requires a factor of 10, and 10 is the product of 2 and 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). Typically, there are more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is dictated by the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero. This function \\( Z(n) \\) is non-decreasing, meaning as \\( n \\) increases, \\( Z(n) \\) either stays the same or increases.\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (left bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (right bound). The numbers \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros lie in the interval \\([left\\_bound, right\\_bound - 1]\\).\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., when \\( m \\) is larger than the maximum possible trailing zeros for practical \\( n \\)), the output should reflect that there are no solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n            \n    L_bound = left\n    \n    right_next = 5 * (m + 2)\n    right_bound = 0\n    while left < right_next:\n        mid = (left + right_next) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m + 1:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right_bound = mid\n            right_next = mid + 1\n            \n    numbers = []\n    start = L_bound\n    end = right_bound - 1\n    if end >= start:\n        for n_val in range(start, end + 1):\n            if trailing_zeros(n_val) == m:\n                numbers.append(str(n_val))\n        k = len(numbers)\n        result_str = \"\\n\".join([str(k)] + [numbers[i] + \" \" + numbers[i+1] if i > 0 else numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)-1)]) if k > 1 else str(k)\n        print(result_str)\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer \\( m \\), which represents the required number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The helper function `trailing_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by counting the factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: The binary search is used to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) (left bound) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) (right bound) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). This helps in determining the range of \\( n \\) values that have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n4. **Output Handling**: After identifying the valid range, the solution checks each number in the range to confirm it has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The results are formatted and printed, showing the count of such numbers followed by the numbers themselves in increasing order. If no numbers are found, it simply outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.",
