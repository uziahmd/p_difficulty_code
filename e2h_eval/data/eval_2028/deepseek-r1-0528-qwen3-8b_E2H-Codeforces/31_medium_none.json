Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can have any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover with one card is x.\n\n 4. We are allowed to use multiple cards. We want the minimum number of cards.\n\n Observation:\n  - If S == 0, then we need 0 additional cards.\n\n  - Otherwise, we are going to try to cover the deficit (which is -S) by adding cards.\n\n 5. Since we can choose any numbers from -x to x, we can think of it as: we want to represent the deficit (which is a number, say T = -S) as a sum of k integers, each between -x and x, and we want the smallest k.\n\n 6. However note: the problem doesn't require that we use only positive or negative numbers. We can mix.\n\n 7. Actually, we can also consider that the deficit T might be positive or negative. Without loss of generality, let T = -S. Then we want to represent T as a sum of k integers, each in [-x, x].\n\n 8. What is the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards?\n    - The maximum absolute value with k cards is k*x (by taking all x or all -x). But note: we can also use zeros and mixed signs, but the extreme is still k*x.\n\n 9. So we must have |T| <= k*x.\n\n 10. But note: we don't necessarily need to use the same sign. However, the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= |T|.\n\n 11. However, sometimes we might not be able to represent T exactly even if k*x >= |T|. For example, if T is 1 and x=2, then with k=1 we can represent 1 (because 1 is in [-2,2]). But what if T is 3 and x=2? Then k=2: we can do 2+1, but wait 1 is allowed because 1 is in [-2,2]? Actually, we can use two cards: one 2 and one 1, but wait we are allowed to choose any integer from -2 to 2. However, the example input says:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> deficit T = -(-1+1+2) = -2. So we need to add a card with -2. So answer is 1.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> current sum is -4. Deficit is 4. We need to add cards such that the total sum added is 4. With x=3, the maximum per card is 3. So we need at least ceil(4/3) = 2 cards. And indeed, 3+1 is not allowed because 1 is allowed? Actually, wait: we can use two cards: 3 and 1? But wait, we can use two cards: both 2? Actually, 2+2=4, and 2 is in [-3,3] so that's okay.\n\n 12. But note: we are not limited to using only positive numbers. However, since T is positive (if we consider absolute value), we can use positive numbers.\n\n 13. Actually, the deficit T can be positive or negative. But note: the condition is symmetric. We can always use the opposite sign.\n\n 14. However, there is a catch: sometimes we cannot form T with k cards even if k*x >= |T|. For example, if T is 1 and x=1, then k=1 is enough. But if T is 1 and x=0, then we cannot form T (but x>=1 by input so no problem). \n\n 15. But wait, what if T is not divisible by 1? Actually, we can form any integer T with one card if |T|<=x. Similarly, for two cards: we can form any integer between -2*x and 2*x? Actually, the set of numbers we can form with two cards is from -2*x to 2*x, but not necessarily every integer? Actually, no: we can form every integer in the range [-2*x, 2*x] because we can use two cards: the first card can be any value from -x to x, and the second card can adjust by any value from -x to x. The set of sums is continuous? Actually, we can get every integer between -2*x and 2*x.\n\n Why? Consider: we want to form a number t. We choose the first card arbitrarily, then the second card must be t - a, and we require that |t - a| <= x. Since a can be chosen from [-x, x], then t must be in [a_min - x, a_max + x] = [-x -x, x+x] = [-2*x, 2*x]. But also, for a fixed t, we can choose a such that a is in [-x, x] and t - a is in [-x, x] <=> a in [t-x, t+x] and a in [-x, x]. The intersection [max(-x, t-x), min(x, t+x)] must be non-empty. Since the entire interval for t is [-2*x, 2*x] and the step is 1, we can form every integer in that interval.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning for two cards: the set of sums is all integers from -2*x to 2*x.\n\n Similarly, for k cards, we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n  Let T = -S (the deficit)\n  Then we are looking for the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that:\n      k*x >= |T|\n\n  But wait: is that sufficient? Because we can form every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. So if |T| <= k*x, then we can form T.\n\n  However, note: the condition is that we can form T if and only if |T| <= k*x. Then the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  Then k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n  But wait: what if T is 0? Then k_min=0, which is correct.\n\n  However, there is an exception: what if we have multiple cards, and we can use more than the minimal k? But we are looking for the minimum.\n\n  But wait: consider the example: \n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S = -4, T = 4.\n        Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2.\n\n  Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        S = (-1+1+2)=2, T=-2 -> |T|=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1.\n\n  Another example: \n        Suppose T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. \n        Indeed, with two cards: we can do 2+1 (since 1 is allowed because 1<=2).\n\n  However, wait: is it always true that we can form T with k cards if k*x >= |T|? \n        Yes, because we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x.\n\n  But note: the problem does not require that we use the same sign. However, the above reasoning holds for the entire range.\n\n  However, wait: what if T is negative? Then we can use negative cards. The same reasoning applies because the range is symmetric.\n\n 16. Therefore, the answer should be:\n        k = ceil(|T| / x)   if |T| != 0\n\n  BUT: There's a catch. The above reasoning is based on the fact that with k cards we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]. However, note that we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x] for each card, so the set of achievable sums is indeed all integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n  However, wait: consider k=1, then we can form any integer from -x to x. Then for k=2, we can form any integer from -2*x to 2*x? Actually, yes: \n        For k=2: the smallest sum is -2*x, the largest is 2*x, and we can get every integer in between.\n\n  Why? \n        Let a and b be in [-x, x]. Then a+b can be from -2*x to 2*x. Now, can we get every integer in between?\n        We can: \n            Start from -2*x, then we can increase by 1 by changing one card: for example, from (-x, -x) to (-x, -x+1) and so on until (x,x).\n\n        But note: the steps are by 1. However, we can change one card by 1 and then the next by 1, etc. So the set is contiguous.\n\n 17. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k (nonnegative) such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  However, note: k must be an integer and k>=0.\n\n  So k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   [if |T|>0, then k_min is the smallest integer not less than |T|/x]\n\n  But wait: if |T|==0, then k_min=0.\n\n  Example: \n      Input: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> T=-2, so |T|=2, ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1.\n\n  However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any cards.\n\n 18. But wait: what if the deficit is 0, then we output 0.\n\n 19. However, let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> T= - ( (-1+1+2) ) = -2 -> |T|=2 -> k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> T= -(-4)=4 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n 20. But wait: what if the deficit is 5 and x=3? Then k_min = ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. However, 2*3=6 >=5, so we can form 5? \n        We can form 5 with two cards: for example, 3+2=5, and 2 is in [-3,3]. So yes.\n\n 21. However, consider the following: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1000? Then k_min=ceil(1/1000)=1. Correct.\n\n 22. But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card. However, what if the deficit is 0, then k_min=0.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the found cards are given, and we are to find the minimum number of additional cards.\n\n 24. However, there is a caveat: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n 25. Therefore, the answer is: \n        Let S = sum(found_cards)\n        Let T = -S\n        Let abs_T = abs(T)\n\n        If abs_T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        Else:\n            k = ceil(abs_T / x)\n\n        But wait: what if abs_T is very large? But note: the found cards are n (at most 1000) and each card is at most x (at most 1000) in absolute value. So the maximum |S| is at most 1000 * 1000 = 1000000, so abs_T is at most 1000000. Then k is at most ceil(1000000/1)=1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n 26. However, wait: is the minimal k really just ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n        Example: T=0 -> 0, then 0 cards.\n\n        Example: T=1, x=2 -> ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n 27. But wait: what if T is negative? Then we use the absolute value.\n\n 28. Therefore, code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_sum = sum(cards)\n        deficit = -total_sum\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n\n        # If deficit is 0, then no card needed.\n        if abs_deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Calculate the minimal k: smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_deficit\n            # k = ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n            import math\n            k = math.ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n            print(k)\n\n 29. However, wait: let me test with an example where the deficit is 2 and x=3: \n        k = ceil(2/3) = ceil(0.66) = 1 -> correct.\n\n 30. But wait, what if deficit is 3 and x=2? Then k=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n 31. However, consider another approach: sometimes we might need more than one card even if the deficit is small, because we cannot use fractions? But the above formula uses ceiling division.\n\n 32. But wait: is there a case where the deficit is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n 33. However, wait: the above reasoning is based on the fact that the set of achievable sums with k cards is [-k*x, k*x] and we can form every integer in between. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n 34. But wait: the problem statement example 2: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total_sum = -4, deficit=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n 35. However, note that the example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> total_sum=2, deficit=-2, abs_deficit=2, ceil(2/2)=1.\n\n 36. This matches.\n\n 37. But wait: what if the deficit is 5 and x=3? Then k=ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. And 2*3=6>=5, so we can form 5.\n\n 38. But wait: what if the deficit is 5 and x=2? Then k=ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. And 3*2=6>=5, so we can form 5.\n\n 39. However, is there a possibility that we can form the deficit with fewer cards if we use negative numbers? Actually, no: the deficit is 5 (positive) so we need positive numbers. But note: the deficit could be negative, then we use negative numbers.\n\n 40. But note: the deficit is defined as -S, so if S is positive then deficit is negative, and vice versa. But the absolute value is taken.\n\n 41. Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        deficit = -s\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n\n        if abs_deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We need to find the smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_deficit\n            # k = ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n            # Alternatively, we can use: (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x   but this is for positive integers and floor division, but note: ceiling division for positive numbers: ceil(a/b) = (a-1)//b + 1\n            # But since we are using math.ceil, and the inputs are integers, we can use:\n\n            # Using math.ceil: convert to float? But abs_deficit and x are integers.\n\n            # Alternatively, without math module:\n\n            # k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x   ? Let me check:\n            #   If abs_deficit % x != 0, then (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x = ceil(abs_deficit/x)\n            #   But if abs_deficit % x == 0, then (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x = (abs_deficit//x) + (x-1)//x, but wait: if divisible, then (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x = (abs_deficit//x) + (x-1)//x, but (x-1)//x is 0, so it becomes abs_deficit//x, which is the integer part. Actually, no: for example, abs_deficit=4, x=3: \n            #       4//3 = 1, then (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3 = 2 -> correct.\n            #   For abs_deficit=3, x=3: (3+3-1)//3 = 5//3 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> but 3/3=1, so we want 1. But wait, 5//3 is 1 (floor) in Python? Actually, 5//3 is 1, but we want 1. However, the formula for ceiling is: (n + d - 1) // d, which works for positive integers.\n\n            # But note: our numbers are positive (abs_deficit>=0, x>=1). \n\n            # However, the problem says: n>=1, x>=1.\n\n            # We can use integer arithmetic:\n\n            #   k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n\n            # But wait: if abs_deficit is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1). Then we can handle 0 as well.\n\n            # However, we already handled 0. But we can simplify:\n\n            #   k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n\n            # But wait: what if abs_deficit is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, then (x-1)//x is 0). So we can remove the if?\n\n            # Actually, we can compute k without the if:\n\n            #   k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n\n            # But note: when abs_deficit==0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0, which is correct.\n\n            # Therefore, we can write:\n\n            k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n\n            # However, wait: is this always the ceiling? \n            #   Example: abs_deficit=1, x=2 -> (1+2-1)//2 = (2)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> but 3//2 is 1 (floor) and we want ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=5, x=3 -> (5+3-1)//3 = 7//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in floor) -> but ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> correct.\n\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=6, x=3 -> (6+3-1)//3 = 8//3 = 2 (floor) but wait, 8//3 is 2? Actually, 8//3 is 2 (because floor division truncates toward -infinity? Actually, in Python, for positive numbers, floor division is standard). But wait, 8//3 is 2, but ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\n            #   Example: abs_deficit=7, x=3 -> (7+3-1)//3 = 9//3=3 -> ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3 -> correct.\n\n            # Therefore, we can use integer arithmetic.\n\n            print(k)\n\n 42. But wait: is the ceiling division formula (n + d - 1) // d valid for positive integers? Yes.\n\n 43. However, note: the problem states that the deficit is the absolute value, so it is nonnegative.\n\n 44. Therefore, we can write the code without the if:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        deficit_abs = abs(-s)   # which is abs(s) but wait: let me check: s is the sum, then deficit is -s, then absolute is abs(-s)=abs(s). So we can also do abs(s) but note: the deficit is -s, so we take absolute value of that, which is the same as abs(s) because abs(-s)=abs(s). \n\n        Actually, we can simply compute:\n\n        total = sum(cards)\n        required = -total\n        abs_required = abs(required)\n\n        But note: if total is negative, then required is positive, and abs(required) = -total (if total negative). If total is positive, then required is negative, and abs(required)=total.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        abs_required = abs(sum(cards))\n\n        But wait: no. The deficit is -total, so the absolute deficit is abs(total) because:\n\n            deficit = -total, then |deficit| = |-total| = |total|\n\n        So we can simply compute:\n\n            abs_required = abs(sum(cards))\n\n        Then the minimal k is ceil(|total|/x) = ceil(abs_required/x)\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            s = sum(cards)\n            abs_required = abs(s)   # because deficit = -s, so |deficit| = |s|\n\n            k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n\n            print(k)\n\n 45. But wait: is that correct? Let's test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s = 2, abs_required=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (since 3//2 is 1 in integer floor) -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, abs_required=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n 46. However, note: the deficit is defined as -s, so the amount we need to add is -s. But the absolute value of the deficit is |s|, because if s is positive, we need to add -s (negative) and if s is negative, we need to add -s (positive). In both cases, the absolute value of the amount we need to add is |s|.\n\n 47. Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        abs_total = abs(total)\n        # If total is 0, then abs_total=0, then k= (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0) -> correct.\n\n        k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n 48. However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card, and (0+x-1)//x is 0. That's correct.\n\n 49. But wait: is that the minimal k? \n\n        Example: deficit is 0 -> k=0.\n\n        Example: deficit is 1 -> k=ceil(1/x). If x>=1, then 1/x <=1, so ceil(1/x) is 1 if x>=1. But if x=1, then 1/1=1 -> ceil=1. If x=2, then ceil(1/2)=1.\n\n        Example: deficit is 2, x=1 -> ceil(2/1)=2.\n\n        Example: deficit is 2, x=3 -> ceil(2/3)=1.\n\n 50. All these are correct.\n\n 51. However, wait: the problem says the found cards are given, and we are to find the minimum number of additional cards. \n\n 52. But wait: the above reasoning assumed that the deficit is the only constraint. However, note that we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. The above formula gives the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n 53. But is that the minimal k? \n\n        We can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. Therefore, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n 54. Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n 55. However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then k=0.\n\n 56. Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> total=2, abs_total=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 -> Output 1.\n\n        Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total=-4, abs_total=4, k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> Output 2.\n\n 57. But wait, the sample input format: the first line is two integers, the second line is n integers.\n\n 58. However, the example input was given as a string in the example, but the problem reads from stdin.\n\n 59. Code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        abs_total = abs(total)\n        k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n 60. But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0, which is correct.\n\n 61. However, wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1? Then k= (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\n 62. But wait: consider a different scenario: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n 63. But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but we have a card with 0? Then the total is 0, so deficit is 0.\n\n 64. The code is correct.\n\n 65. However, wait: there is an alternative solution that might be simpler? \n\n        We are only concerned with the absolute value of the deficit. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |deficit|.\n\n        This is the same as: k = ceil(|deficit| / x)\n\n 66. But note: the above integer formula (abs_total + x - 1) // x is the same as ceiling division for positive integers.\n\n 67. Final code.\n\n However, wait: there is a catch! \n\n        Example: deficit_abs=0 -> k=0, correct.\n\n        Example: deficit_abs=1, x=1 -> (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: deficit_abs=1, x=2 -> (1+2-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: deficit_abs=2, x=1 -> (2+1-1)//1=2//1=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: deficit_abs=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2=4//2=2 -> correct.\n\n 68. But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0, which is correct.\n\n 69. However, wait: the problem says the initial set has infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range. The above reasoning holds.\n\n 70. But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\". The above calculation gives the minimal k.\n\n 71. Submit the code.\n\n However, wait: I just thought of an example where the deficit is 3 and x=2: \n        We need to form 3 (if deficit is 3, meaning we need to add 3). With two cards: maximum per card is 2, so 2+1=3, and 1 is in [-2,2] so it's allowed. So two cards.\n\n        Our formula: ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n 72. Another example: deficit_abs=4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> two cards: 2+2=4, correct.\n\n 73. But wait: what if deficit_abs=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> two cards: 3+2=5, and 2 is allowed (<=3). Correct.\n\n 74. However, wait: what if deficit_abs=6, x=3 -> ceil(6/3)=2 -> two cards: 3+3=6, correct.\n\n 75. But wait: what if deficit_abs=7, x=3 -> ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3 -> three cards: 3+3+1=7, correct.\n\n 76. Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        # If the total is zero, then we don't need any card.\n        # But the formula (abs_s + x - 1) // x works for 0 as well.\n\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then k=0, and that is correct.\n\n However, wait: consider the example where the deficit is 0, but we have n=0? But n>=1, so we always have at least one card.\n\n But wait: the problem says: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from  - x to x.\" and we are given n (number of found cards) and then n integers.\n\n 77. However, wait: the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n 78. But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but we are given an odd number of zeros? Then the total is 0, and we output 0.\n\n 79. It's correct.\n\n 80. However, wait: what if the deficit is 0, but the found cards are not zeros? For example, [1, -1, 2, -2] -> total=0, then deficit=0, so we output 0.\n\n 81. Correct.\n\n 82. Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> total= (-1+1+2)=2, abs_s=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 (since 3//2 is 1 in integer division) -> output 1.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total=-4, abs_s=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n 83. But wait, the example input in the problem is given as:\n\n        Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n        So the first example input is \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\", and the second is \"2 3\\n-2 -2\".\n\n 84. The code reads from stdin, so we can test with:\n\n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n        Output: 1\n\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n\n        Output: 2\n\n 85. However, wait: the problem says the first line contains two integers: n and x. Then the second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n        In the example: \n            First example: n=3, x=2, then the next line has 3 integers: -1 1 2.\n\n        Second example: n=2, x=3, then the next line has 2 integers: -2 -2.\n\n 86. The code reads the first two integers from the first line, then the next line is read as a list of n integers.\n\n 87. But wait: what if the input is given in one line? The problem says: \n        The first line contains two integers: n and x.\n        The second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n 88. Therefore, the code is reading two lines.\n\n 89. However, the example input in the problem is given as a string with two elements, but that's just the example representation.\n\n 90. We are good.\n\n 91. But wait: what if the deficit_abs is 0, then k=0, but what if we are forced to use some cards due to the way the deficit is defined? No, because deficit_abs=0 means we don't need to add anything.\n\n 92. Therefore, the final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n However, wait: wait a minute, I just realized: the deficit_abs is |sum(arr)|, but the deficit is -sum(arr). However, the absolute value of the deficit is |sum(arr)|, so we are correct.\n\n But wait: what if the deficit is negative? Then we need to add positive numbers? Actually, the deficit is -sum(arr). The absolute value of the deficit is |sum(arr)|, so we are covering the absolute value.\n\n 93. However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? Then we need to add a positive amount. But the absolute value is the same.\n\n 94. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n Let me test with an example where the total is negative:\n\n        Example: n=1, x=5, cards=[-3]\n            total = -3, deficit_abs=3, k = (3+5-1)//5 = 7//5=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, x=5, cards=[3]\n            total=3, deficit_abs=3, k=1 -> correct.\n\n 95. One more: n=2, x=5, cards=[-3,-3] -> total=-6, deficit_abs=6, k=(6+5-1)//5=10//5=2 -> correct.\n\n 96. But wait: what if we have n=2, x=5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced out by the sum of the additional cards. The deficit is calculated as the absolute value of the negative of the sum of the found cards. The goal is to find the smallest number of cards (each with a value between -x and x) such that their sum equals this deficit.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by how large each card's value can be (up to x). The sum of k cards can range from -k*x to k*x. Therefore, the smallest k such that k*x is at least the deficit will be our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the absolute value of the sum of the found cards (deficit). The minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of the division of the deficit by x. This can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic: `(abs_deficit + x - 1) // x`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves summing the list of found cards (O(n)) and performing simple arithmetic operations (O(1)), making the overall complexity O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(arr)\nabs_s = abs(s)\nk = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\nprint(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line reads the list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The absolute value of this sum gives the deficit that needs to be balanced out by the additional cards.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards required is found by computing the ceiling of the division of the deficit by x. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations: `(abs_s + x - 1) // x`.\n4. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of additional cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insight to solve the problem with minimal computational overhead, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
