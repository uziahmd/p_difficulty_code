Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can have any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover with one card is x.\n\n 4. We are allowed to use multiple cards. We want the minimum number of cards.\n\n Observation:\n We can think of the problem as: what is the minimum number of cards (each with value between -x and x) such that their sum is T = -S?\n\n However, note that we can also use negative cards. The key is that we can choose any integer in [-x, x] for each card.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let k be the number of additional cards. Then we require that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) such that:\n     a1 + a2 + ... + ak = T\n\n What is the minimum k?\n\n Note: The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and the maximum negative sum is -k*x.\n\n So, we require |T| <= k*x.\n\n But note: we can also mix positive and negative. Actually, the necessary condition is that |T| <= k*x.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Not exactly. Because if we have k cards, we can achieve any integer value between -k*x and k*x? \n Actually, no. We can only achieve values that are congruent to k*x modulo something? But wait, we can choose any integers in [-x, x]. \n\n Actually, by the coin problem (or Frobenius number) for multiple denominations, but here the denominations are symmetric and consecutive? \n However, note: we can use any integer from -x to x, so the set of achievable sums for k cards is every integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] that has the same parity as k*x? Not necessarily.\n\n But note: the set of integers from -x to x includes both positive and negative and zero. The sum of k cards can be any integer between -k*x and k*x? \n\n Actually, yes: because we can use the following strategy: \n   We can adjust the last card to fix the remainder. However, we must check:\n\n   For k=1: we can get every integer from -x to x.\n   For k=2: we can get every integer from -2x to 2x, because for example, to get an even number, we can use two same numbers, and for odd? Actually, if x is large enough, we can use one card to adjust the sign and then the other to adjust the magnitude.\n\n However, let's think: \n   With k cards, the minimal absolute sum we can achieve is 0 (if k>=1 and x>=1, we can use two opposite numbers). But wait, we don't need to achieve 0, we need to achieve T.\n\n Actually, we can achieve every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] if we are allowed to use any integers from [-x,x]. Why?\n   Base: k=1 -> [-x, x] -> all integers in that range.\n   Assume for k-1 we can achieve every integer in [-(k-1)*x, (k-1)*x]. Now for k, we can take any card from [-x,x] and add it to the previous set. Then the new set would be from -(k-1)*x - x = -k*x to (k-1)*x+x = k*x. Moreover, we can fill all integers in between because the step is 1 (since we have consecutive integers from -x to x, and the previous set was contiguous). \n\n Therefore, the condition is: we can achieve T with k cards if and only if |T| <= k*x.\n\n Now, we are to find the minimum k (nonnegative integer) such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n But note: k must be at least ceil(|T|/x) because k*x >= |T|.\n\n So, the answer is the smallest integer k >= ceil(|T|/x).\n\n However, wait: what if T is 0? Then we don't need any card, so k=0.\n\n Also, note: T might be negative? Actually, T is defined as -S, so T could be positive or negative, but we use absolute value.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the required sum from the additional cards and then finding the smallest number of cards that can achieve this sum given the constraints on each card's value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vanya has `n` found cards with numbers, and he can find additional cards with any integer from `-x` to `x`.\n   - The goal is to make the total sum of all cards zero by adding the fewest possible cards.\n   - The sum of the found cards is `S`, so the additional cards must sum to `-S`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Each additional card can contribute a value between `-x` and `x`. Therefore, the maximum absolute sum achievable with `k` cards is `k*x`.\n   - To achieve a target sum `T = -S`, the smallest number of cards `k` must satisfy `|T| ≤ k*x`. The minimal `k` is the ceiling of `|T| / x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Calculate the sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - Compute the target sum `T = -S`.\n   - Determine the minimal `k` such that `k*x >= |T|`. This `k` is given by `ceil(|T| / x)`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `T` is zero, no additional cards are needed (`k = 0`).\n   - If the calculated `k` is zero (i.e., `|T|` is zero or negative), the answer is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    T = -total_sum\n    \n    if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = abs(T) / x\n    if k.is_integer():\n        print(int(k))\n    else:\n        print(int(k) + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum `T` for the additional cards is the negation of this sum.\n3. **Target Sum Check**: If the target sum `T` is zero, the answer is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Finding Minimum Cards**: For non-zero `T`, the minimal number of cards `k` is calculated as the ceiling of `|T| / x`. This is done by checking if `|T|` is divisible by `x`; if it is, `k` is exactly `|T| / x`; otherwise, `k` is the next integer.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of additional cards required.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional checks to determine the minimal number of cards needed.",
