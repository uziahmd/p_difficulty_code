Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Conditions:\n   Two vouchers i and j must have total duration = x (i.e., (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x)\n   They must not intersect: either voucher i ends before voucher j starts (r_i < l_j) or voucher j ends before voucher i starts (r_j < l_i)\n\n Steps:\n   1. We note that the total duration is x, so if we let d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1), then we need two vouchers i and j such that d_i + d_j = x.\n\n   2. We cannot try all pairs because n can be up to 200,000.\n\n Approach:\n   We can group the vouchers by their duration. But note: there might be multiple vouchers with same duration.\n\n   However, we also have the condition that the two vouchers do not overlap. So for a given voucher i (with [l_i, r_i] and duration d_i),\n   we need to look for a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i, and such that the intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not overlap.\n\n   How to check non-overlap? \n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j OR Condition 2: r_j < l_i.\n\n   But note: the two conditions are symmetric. So we can consider:\n\n   Let's break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: Group the vouchers by duration. For each duration d, we will keep a list of intervals (l, r) and also the cost.\n\n   However, storing all intervals for a given duration might be heavy (up to 200,000 groups, but the sum of sizes is 200,000). Actually, the total number of vouchers is n=200,000, so we can group by duration.\n\n   Part 2: For each voucher i (duration d_i), we want to find a voucher j (duration d_j = x - d_i) such that the two intervals do not overlap and the total cost (cost_i + cost_j) is minimized.\n\n   But how to quickly check for a voucher j (with fixed duration d_j) which intervals (from the same duration group) do not overlap with a given interval [l_i, r_i]?\n\n   Note: The non-overlap condition for two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] is: b < c OR d < a.\n\n   For a fixed voucher i (with [l_i, r_i]), and we are looking for a voucher j in the group with duration d_j = x-d_i, we require:\n        Either: r_i < l_j   (voucher i ends before j starts) OR r_j < l_i (voucher j ends before i starts).\n\n   However, note that the second condition (r_j < l_i) is independent of the first. But we can split the problem:\n\n   Idea: Precompute for each duration d, two sets of information:\n\n     Option A: All intervals (l, r) with duration d.\n\n   Then for a given voucher i (with duration d_i) and target duration d_j = x - d_i, we need to consider two cases:\n\n      Case 1: The other voucher j must start after r_i (so that j doesn't overlap with i). Then we look for the minimal cost voucher j in duration d_j that has l_j > r_i.\n\n      Case 2: The other voucher j must end before l_i (so that j doesn't overlap with i). Then we look for the minimal cost voucher j in duration d_j that has r_j < l_i.\n\n   Then the candidate for voucher i would be the minimum between the best voucher from Case 1 and Case 2.\n\n   Then we take the minimum over all i.\n\n   However, we cannot iterate over every voucher i and then over the entire group for duration d_j (which might be large) because that would be O(n^2) in worst-case.\n\n   We need to preprocess the groups for each duration d.\n\n   Steps for preprocessing:\n\n      Step 1: Group the vouchers by duration. Let `groups` be a dictionary mapping duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n      Step 2: For each duration d that appears, we want to create data structures that allow us to query:\n\n          Query 1: For a given value `t` (which will be the end of voucher i, so we need l_j > t), what is the minimal cost among all vouchers in this duration group that have l_j > t?\n          Query 2: For a given value `t` (which will be the start of voucher i, so we need r_j < t), what is the minimal cost among all vouchers in this duration group that have r_j < t?\n\n      We can use segment trees or Fenwick trees? But note: the coordinates (l and r) are from 1 to 200,000.\n\n      Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n          Sort the list of (l, r, cost) by l for Query 1 and by r for Query 2.\n\n          Then for Query 1: We want to find the minimal cost among all vouchers with l > t. We can do:\n\n            Sort by l, then for each voucher we have (l, r, cost). Then we can create an array for the sorted l's and then store the minimal cost for all vouchers from a certain index onward.\n\n          Similarly, for Query 2: sort by r, and then store the minimal cost for all vouchers up to a certain r.\n\n      However, note: we are going to query by a threshold on one coordinate (either l or r) and we want the minimal cost in the entire set above that threshold.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          For each duration d, let list1 = sorted list of (l, r, cost) by l.\n          Then, we can create an array `min_cost_from_right` for list1: \n                min_cost_from_right[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end (in terms of increasing l)\n\n          Similarly, for the same duration d, let list2 = sorted list of (l, r, cost) by r.\n          Then, create an array `min_cost_from_left` for list2: \n                min_cost_from_left[i] = minimum cost from index 0 to i.\n\n      Then, for a query with threshold t for l (Case 1):\n\n          In list1 (sorted by l), we want the first index where l > t. Then the minimal cost from that index to the end is stored in min_cost_from_right at that index.\n\n      Similarly, for a query with threshold t for r (Case 2):\n\n          In list2 (sorted by r), we want the last index where r < t. Then the minimal cost from the beginning to that index is stored in min_cost_from_left.\n\n   But note: the same voucher might appear in both lists? Actually, no, because we are grouping by duration and then sorting by l and by r separately.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the same voucher is included in both, but that's okay because we are just using the same data.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n      Step 1: Read input, group by duration.\n\n      Step 2: For each duration d that exists, and for the list of vouchers (each is (l, r, cost)):\n\n          - Create list1: sort by l, and then create an array `min_cost_from_right` for this sorted list.\n          - Create list2: sort by r, and then create an array `min_cost_from_left` for this sorted list.\n\n      Step 3: Then for each voucher i (which we will iterate over all vouchers) with duration d_i, we consider:\n\n          d_j = x - d_i\n\n          If d_j is not in the groups, skip.\n\n          Then, we have two cases:\n\n          Case 1: Look for a voucher j in group[d_j] that satisfies r_i < l_j (i.e., the other voucher starts after the current one ends).\n\n                  We use the list1 of group[d_j] (which is sorted by l) to find the minimal cost among those with l_j > r_i.\n\n          Case 2: Look for a voucher j in group[d_j] that satisfies r_j < l_i (the other voucher ends before the current one starts).\n\n                  We use the list2 of group[d_j] (which is sorted by r) to find the minimal cost among those with r_j < l_i.\n\n          Then, the candidate for voucher i is the minimum of the two found costs (if both exist).\n\n      Then we take the minimum candidate over all vouchers i.\n\n   But wait: we are iterating over every voucher i. And for each i, we are doing two binary searches (each O(log(size of d_j))) and then constant time lookups. The total work is O(n * log(m)) where m is the maximum size of a group, which is acceptable since n is 200,000 and the groups might be large but the total number of vouchers is 200,000.\n\n   However, note: the same pair might be considered twice? But we are considering each voucher i as the first and then looking for any j (including j that might be the same as i? No, because we are grouping by duration and we require two distinct vouchers). But note: we are grouping by duration, and the same voucher i is only in its own duration group, and we are looking in a different group (d_j). Also, we are not checking that j != i, but that's okay because the durations are different (unless d_i = d_j and d_i + d_i = x, then d_i = x/2). In that case, we are considering two distinct vouchers from the same duration group. But note: the problem says two distinct vouchers (i != j). So we must ensure that when d_i = d_j, we are not accidentally picking the same voucher? \n\n   Actually, the condition for non-overlap is independent of the identity. But note: the same voucher cannot be used twice. However, in our method, we are storing the entire list of vouchers for a duration. Then when we query for a voucher i (which has duration d_i = x/2) and then look in the same duration group (because d_j = x/2 = d_i) for a voucher j, we might pick voucher i itself? \n\n   How to avoid that? \n\n   We must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct. However, the problem does not require that the two vouchers are distinct in the sense of being the same voucher, but they must be two different vouchers (i != j). But note: the same duration group might contain multiple copies (same interval? or same details?) but even if two vouchers have the same (l, r, cost) they are still two different vouchers.\n\n   However, if we have two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) then they are two different ones. But if we have one voucher and then look for another with the same (l, r, cost) and same duration, then we are allowed to take two distinct ones.\n\n   But wait: the problem states \"exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\".\n\n   However, note: the input may have duplicate vouchers? The problem does not say they are distinct. But even if there are duplicates, they are considered different vouchers.\n\n   But here's the catch: when we are processing voucher i, we are considering all vouchers j (with duration d_j) that satisfy the non-overlap condition. This includes the possibility that j is the same voucher as i? \n\n   Actually, no: because we are grouping by duration. When d_i = d_j, then we are in the same group. But we must not use the same voucher twice. However, the problem does not specify that the two vouchers must be distinct in content, only that they are two different vouchers. So if we have two identical vouchers, then we can use them as two distinct ones.\n\n   But note: if we have only one voucher in the duration group d_j, then we cannot form two distinct ones. So when d_i = d_j, we must ensure that we are not taking the same voucher. However, our method does not distinguish which voucher we are taking. We are storing all vouchers. \n\n   But note: we are iterating over every voucher i, and for each i we look in the group d_j (which includes all vouchers of that duration). This includes the possibility that j is the same as i if the same voucher appears twice? \n\n   Actually, no: because the input gives n vouchers, and we are storing each voucher separately. So if the same voucher (with same l, r, cost) appears twice, then we have two entries in the group. Then when we process the first occurrence, we might pick the second occurrence (and vice versa). That is acceptable.\n\n   However, if we have only one voucher in the group d_j and d_i = d_j, then we cannot form two distinct ones. But note: we are processing every voucher i. Then if we have two vouchers with the same (l, r, cost) and same duration, then they are two distinct ones. But if we have one voucher, then we cannot form two distinct ones from the same group.\n\n   Therefore, we must not use the same voucher twice. But our method does not know which voucher is which. \n\n   How to handle? \n\n   We are storing the entire list of vouchers. We are not marking which one is i. \n\n   However, note: the condition for non-overlap is independent of the identity. But if we have two vouchers that are the same (same [l, r]) then they are non-overlapping if they are disjoint. But two identical intervals [l, r] and [l, r] will always overlap (unless they are the same, then they are overlapping). \n\n   Actually, two intervals [l, r] and [l, r] (same) will have r_i >= l_j (since l_j = l <= r) and similarly for the other, so they do overlap. \n\n   But wait: the condition for non-overlap is: \n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j -> then the first ends before the second starts -> so they don't overlap.\n        Condition 2: r_j < l_i -> then the second ends before the first starts.\n\n   So two identical intervals [l, r] and [l, r] do not satisfy Condition 1 (because r_i = r >= l_j = l) and Condition 2 (r_j = r >= l_i = l) so they do overlap.\n\n   Therefore, even if we have two identical vouchers, they are not disjoint. So we cannot use two identical vouchers.\n\n   But if we have two different vouchers that happen to have the same (l, r) and same duration, they still are two separate vouchers, but they are overlapping. So they are not disjoint.\n\n   Therefore, we must ensure that we are not accidentally pairing a voucher with itself. However, our method does not consider the same voucher because we are storing the entire list. But if the same voucher appears twice, then we have two entries. Then when we process the first one, we look for a voucher in the same group (if d_i = d_j) and we might find the second one. But we must check that the two intervals are disjoint.\n\n   However, note: the condition for non-overlap must hold. So even if we have two identical vouchers, they are overlapping and thus invalid. \n\n   But wait: two identical vouchers [l, r] and [l, r] are overlapping. So they are invalid. \n\n   Therefore, our method of querying by thresholds (for l and r) will include the second one if we have two identical ones, but then we check the non-overlap condition by the thresholds? Actually, the thresholds are set by the current voucher i. \n\n   Example: \n        Voucher i: [l, r] (duration d_i) and we are looking for a voucher j in the same group (d_j = d_i) with l_j > r_i (which is r) OR r_j < l_i (which is l). But if the other voucher j is [l, r], then l_j = l <= r (so fails the first condition) and r_j = r >= l (so fails the second condition). So the two identical ones are not included.\n\n   Therefore, the query by the thresholds (using the current voucher's l and r) naturally excludes the current voucher (or any voucher that overlaps) because the thresholds are set by the current voucher's boundaries.\n\n   However, what if the current voucher i is [l1, r1] and there is another voucher j in the same group with [l2, r2] that is disjoint? Then we will get it.\n\n   But note: if we have two distinct vouchers (different in content) that are disjoint, then they will be found.\n\n   Therefore, the method is safe.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, x and the list of vouchers.\n\n      Step 2: Group the vouchers by duration (d = r - l + 1). We'll have a dictionary: \n          groups = {}\n          for each voucher (l, r, cost):\n              d = r - l + 1\n              append (l, r, cost) to groups[d]\n\n      Step 3: Preprocess each group d (for each key in groups) to create two structures:\n\n          Structure1 (by l): \n              Sort the list of vouchers (l, r, cost) by l.\n              Then, create an array `min_cost_from_right` for the sorted list: \n                  Traverse from the last element to the first, keeping the minimum cost encountered so far.\n\n          Structure2 (by r):\n              Sort the list of vouchers (l, r, cost) by r.\n              Then, create an array `min_cost_from_left` for the sorted list: \n                  Traverse from the first element to the last, keeping the minimum cost encountered so far.\n\n      Step 4: We will create a helper function to do a binary search for the threshold in the sorted list and then return the minimal cost from the appropriate part.\n\n          For a given sorted list (by l) and the `min_cost_from_right` array, and a threshold t (which is the current voucher's r_i for Case 1):\n\n              We want the smallest index idx such that l[idx] > t. Then the minimal cost for the rest is min_cost_from_right[idx].\n\n          Similarly, for the sorted list (by r) and the `min_cost_from_left` array, and a threshold t (which is the current voucher's l_i for Case 2):\n\n              We want the largest index idx such that r[idx] < t. Then the minimal cost for the left part is min_cost_from_left[idx].\n\n      Step 5: Initialize answer = a very large number (like 10**18)\n\n      Step 6: Iterate over each voucher i (we need to consider each voucher):\n\n          d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1)\n          d_j = x - d_i\n\n          If d_j not in groups: skip.\n\n          Now, we have two cases:\n\n          Case 1: Other voucher must start after r_i (non-overlap condition 1: r_i < l_j)\n\n              Use Structure1 for group[d_j] (sorted by l). We want to find the minimal cost among all vouchers in group[d_j] with l_j > r_i.\n\n          Case 2: Other voucher must end before l_i (non-overlap condition 2: r_j < l_i)\n\n              Use Structure2 for group[d_j] (sorted by r). We want to find the minimal cost among all vouchers in group[d_j] with r_j < l_i.\n\n          Then, if either case returns a valid cost (not None), then candidate = min(case1_cost, case2_cost) [if one is missing, then take the available one]\n\n          Then update the answer = min(answer, candidate)\n\n      Step 7: If answer remains the initial large value, output -1, else output answer.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over every voucher i. This means that if there are two distinct vouchers i and j that form a valid pair, then we will consider the pair twice: once when i is the first and j the second, and once when i is the second and j the first.\n\n   But note: the conditions for the two cases are symmetric? Not exactly, because the roles of i and j are reversed.\n\n   Actually, in the above, we are fixing i and then looking for j. Then when we fix j and look for i, we might get the same pair again. But that's okay because we are updating the answer with the minimum cost. However, we are processing each voucher i individually. \n\n   But wait: the two vouchers i and j are distinct and the conditions for non-overlap are symmetric? Actually, the condition for non-overlap is symmetric: if (i, j) is non-overlapping, then (j, i) is the same. However, the two cases we check for i are:\n\n        Case 1: j must have l_j > r_i\n        Case 2: j must have r_j < l_i\n\n   And these are the two ways to be non-overlapping.\n\n   But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, they are two different conditions. It is possible that one voucher j satisfies one condition and not the other. \n\n   However, the above method for each i considers both conditions. And when we consider j, we don't care about the order. \n\n   But the problem: if we consider the pair (i, j) and (j, i) separately, then we are doing redundant work. But that's acceptable because the total number of vouchers is 200,000 and the work per voucher is O(log(size of group)), and the total work is O(n * log(m)) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by not iterating over every voucher i. But the problem requires two distinct vouchers. We can also consider that the two vouchers are unordered. But the above method is straightforward.\n\n   But note: the same pair (i, j) is considered twice: once as (i, j) and once as (j, i). \n\n   However, in our method, for the pair (i, j):\n\n        When we process i: \n            Case 1: if j has l_j > r_i, then we consider j in the first case.\n            Case 2: if j has r_j < l_i, then we consider j in the second case.\n\n        And when we process j:\n            Case 1: if i has l_i > r_j, then we consider i in the first case.\n            Case 2: if i has r_i < l_j, then we consider i in the second case.\n\n   But note: the two conditions are:\n\n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j   <=>   l_j > r_i\n        Condition 2: r_j < l_i   <=>   l_i > r_j\n\n   These are two different conditions. The pair (i, j) might satisfy one condition, the other, or both? Actually, two intervals are disjoint if at least one holds. \n\n   However, the two conditions are mutually exclusive for two intervals? Actually, no: it is possible that both conditions hold? \n\n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j and Condition 2: r_j < l_i.\n\n        But then we have r_i < l_j and r_j < l_i. Then we have r_i < l_j <= r_j < l_i <= r_i? \n        Because l_j <= r_j (by definition) and l_i <= r_i (by definition). Then we get r_i < ... < r_i, which is impossible unless the intervals are empty. \n\n        So the two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\n   Therefore, for a given pair (i, j) exactly one of the conditions can hold, or none (meaning they overlap). \n\n   But wait: the condition for non-overlap is defined as at least one of the two conditions. So if one condition holds, then they are disjoint.\n\n   However, note: the two conditions are:\n\n        Condition1: r_i < l_j\n        Condition2: r_j < l_i\n\n   And indeed, if both hold, then we have:\n\n        r_i < l_j and r_j < l_i.\n\n        Then, if we assume without loss of generality that l_i <= l_j, then from Condition1: r_i < l_j, and from Condition2: r_j < l_i, then we have r_j < l_i <= l_j, and then r_i < l_j <= r_j (since l_j <= r_j) and then r_i < r_j, but that is consistent. However, we also have l_i <= l_j and r_j < l_i, so l_i <= l_j and r_j < l_i <= l_j, and then the entire interval i is [l_i, r_i] and j is [l_j, r_j] and we have r_j < l_i <= l_j, so the intervals are separated by at least [l_i, l_j] (which is non-empty). \n\n   But wait, the conditions are:\n\n        Condition1: r_i < l_j\n        Condition2: r_j < l_i\n\n   and we have both: then we have two disjoint intervals. \n\n   Actually, the two conditions are independent. They can both hold. \n\n   Example: \n        i: [1, 2], j: [3,4] -> Condition1: 2 < 3 -> true; Condition2: 4 < 1 -> false.\n        i: [1,2], j: [4,5] -> Condition1: 2 < 4 -> true; Condition2: 5 < 1 -> false.\n\n        Now, consider i: [1,3] and j: [2,4]: \n            Condition1: 3 < 2? false.\n            Condition2: 4 < 1? false -> they overlap.\n\n        Consider i: [1,2] and j: [3,4]: Condition1 holds.\n\n        Consider i: [1,2] and j: [0,1]: \n            Condition1: 2 < 0? false.\n            Condition2: 1 < 1? false (since 1 < 1 is false) -> they overlap.\n\n        Now, consider i: [1,2] and j: [3,0] (invalid, since l_j=3 and r_j=0 is not allowed by the input constraints). \n\n        Actually, the input ensures l_j <= r_j.\n\n        Now, consider i: [1,2] and j: [3,1] -> invalid because l_j=3, r_j=1 -> not allowed.\n\n        Now, consider i: [1,3] and j: [4,5]: Condition1: 3 < 4 -> true.\n\n        Now, consider i: [1,3] and j: [0,2]: Condition2: 2 < 1 -> false. Condition1: 3 < 0 -> false -> they overlap.\n\n        Now, consider two intervals that are separated by two parts: i: [1,2] and j: [4,5] -> Condition1 holds.\n\n        Now, consider two intervals that are separated by one part: i: [1,2] and j: [3,4] -> Condition1 holds.\n\n        Now, consider two intervals that are separated by two parts: i: [1,2] and j: [5,6] -> Condition1 holds.\n\n        Now, can Condition2 hold? \n            Condition2: r_j < l_i.\n\n            Example: i: [4,5] and j: [1,2] -> Condition2: 2 < 4 -> true.\n\n        So the two conditions are independent and can occur independently.\n\n        Now, can both hold simultaneously? \n\n            We require: \n                Condition1: r_i < l_j\n                Condition2: r_j < l_i\n\n            Then: \n                r_i < l_j and r_j < l_i.\n\n            Then: \n                l_i > r_j and l_j > r_i.\n\n            And we have the intervals: \n                i: [l_i, r_i] and j: [l_j, r_j]\n\n            Then we have: \n                l_i > r_j and l_j > r_i.\n\n            This implies: \n                l_i > r_j >= l_j > r_i >= l_i   (since l_j > r_i and r_i >= l_i, so l_i > r_j >= l_j > r_i >= l_i -> then l_i > l_i, which is impossible.\n\n            Therefore, the two conditions cannot hold simultaneously.\n\n        So they are mutually exclusive.\n\n   Therefore, for a given pair (i, j) at most one condition holds.\n\n   Then, when we process i, we consider the condition that depends on i's values. But note: the condition for non-overlap is defined by the two intervals. In fact, we can also define:\n\n        Condition1: i ends before j starts -> r_i < l_j\n        Condition2: j ends before i starts -> r_j < l_i\n\n   But note: the problem says \"at least one of the following conditions\" is fulfilled.\n\n   And we are checking both conditions for i. However, for a fixed pair (i, j), exactly one of the two conditions holds (if they are disjoint). \n\n   Therefore, when processing i, we will consider j only in the condition that matches (either Condition1 or Condition2, but not both). \n\n   But note: we are processing i and j is fixed. We are not requiring both conditions to hold, we are requiring at least one. However, the two conditions are independent and we are checking two different things.\n\n   However, our two cases are:\n\n        Case1: Condition1 (r_i < l_j) -> j must have l_j > r_i.\n        Case2: Condition2 (r_j < l_i) -> j must have r_j < l_i.\n\n   And these are the two conditions. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"don't intersect\", which is equivalent to (Condition1 OR Condition2). So we are covering both possibilities.\n\n   However, the above method for Case1 and Case2 are independent. \n\n   But wait: what if a voucher j satisfies both conditions? We just showed that both conditions cannot hold simultaneously. So no problem.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n   Implementation details:\n\n      We need to implement:\n\n        def query_by_l(sorted_list_by_l, min_cost_from_right, threshold):\n            # sorted_list_by_l is a list of (l, r, cost) sorted by l, and min_cost_from_right is an array of the same length as sorted_list_by_l, where min_cost_from_right[i] is the minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n            # We want the first index idx such that sorted_list_by_l[idx][0] > threshold.\n            low = 0\n            high = len(sorted_list_by_l) - 1\n            ans_index = len(sorted_list_by_l)  # meaning not found\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if sorted_list_by_l[mid][0] > threshold:\n                    ans_index = mid\n                    high = mid-1\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n\n            if ans_index == len(sorted_list_by_l):\n                return None   # no voucher found\n            else:\n                return min_cost_from_right[ans_index]\n\n        Similarly, for query_by_r:\n\n        def query_by_r(sorted_list_by_r, min_cost_from_left, threshold):\n            # sorted_list_by_r is a list of (l, r, cost) sorted by r, and min_cost_from_left is an array of the same length, where min_cost_from_left[i] is the minimum cost from index 0 to i.\n\n            # We want the last index idx such that sorted_list_by_r[idx][1] < threshold.\n            low = 0\n            high = len(sorted_list_by_r) - 1\n            ans_index = -1  # meaning not found\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if sorted_list_by_r[mid][1] < threshold:\n                    ans_index = mid\n                    low = mid+1\n                else:\n                    high = mid-1\n\n            if ans_index == -1:\n                return None\n            else:\n                return min_cost_from_left[ans_index]\n\n   However, note: the sorted_list_by_l and sorted_list_by_r are just the same set of vouchers (by duration) but sorted differently.\n\n   But wait: the structure for the group d_j is built from the same list of vouchers. \n\n   We must be cautious: the same voucher might appear multiple times, but that's okay.\n\n   However, note: the entire list of vouchers for a duration d is stored as a list of (l, r, cost). Then we build:\n\n        list1 = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])   # by l\n        Then, we compute min_cost_from_right for list1.\n\n        list2 = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])   # by r\n        Then, we compute min_cost_from_left for list2.\n\n   Then, the two queries are independent.\n\n   But note: the list1 and list2 are two different sorts. \n\n   Example: \n        groups[d] = [(1,3,10), (2,4,5)]\n        list1 (by l): [(1,3,10), (2,4,5)]\n        min_cost_from_right for list1: \n            Start from the last: \n                index1: (2,4,5) -> min_cost=5\n                index0: (1,3,10) -> min_cost=min(10,5)=5\n            So min_cost_from_right = [5,5]\n\n        list2 (by r): [(1,3,10), (2,4,5)] becomes [(1,3,10), (2,4,5)] (because 3<4) -> same order? \n            Actually, sorted by r: first (1,3,10) then (2,4,5)\n        min_cost_from_left for list2:\n            index0: (1,3,10) -> min_cost=10\n            index1: (2,4,5) -> min_cost=min(10,5)=5\n\n   Then, for a voucher i (say [2,4,5]) and d_j = d, then:\n\n        Case1: threshold = r_i = 4 (for l_j>4) -> in list1, we look for l_j>4 -> there is none -> returns None.\n\n        Case2: threshold = l_i = 2 (for r_j<2) -> in list2, we look for r_j<2 -> none -> returns None.\n\n   So the voucher i alone doesn't form a pair, which is correct because we need two distinct ones.\n\n   But now consider a voucher i (say [1,3,10]) and d_j = d:\n\n        Case1: threshold = 3 (for l_j>3) -> in list1, we look for l_j>3 -> the second voucher (l_j=2) is not, so none -> None.\n\n        Case2: threshold = 1 (for r_j<1) -> none.\n\n   So no pair.\n\n   Now, consider two vouchers: \n        i: (1,3,10) and j: (2,4,5) and d_i = 3, d_j=3, and x=6.\n\n        Then, for i: d_i=3, d_j=3, so we look in the same group.\n\n        Case1 for i: threshold = 3 -> we look for l_j>3 -> none.\n        Case2 for i: threshold = 1 -> we look for r_j<1 -> none.\n\n        For j: d_j=3, d_i=3, same group.\n\n        Case1 for j: threshold = 4 -> look for l_i>4 -> none (since i has l_i=1).\n        Case2 for j: threshold = 2 -> look for r_i<2 -> i has r_i=3 -> no.\n\n        So we don't get the pair. Why? Because the two intervals [1,3] and [2,4] overlap (they share day 2 and 3). \n\n        The non-overlap condition requires one of: \n            Condition1: 3 < 2 (false) OR Condition2: 4 < 1 (false) -> so they are not disjoint.\n\n   Therefore, the example is correctly rejected.\n\n   Another example: \n        i: (1,2,10) and j: (3,4,5) and d_i=2, d_j=2, x=4.\n\n        For i: \n            Case1: threshold = 2 -> look for l_j>2 -> j: l_j=3>2 -> found, cost=5 -> candidate from Case1 is 5.\n            Case2: threshold = 1 -> look for r_j<1 -> none.\n\n            candidate = 5.\n\n        For j:\n            Case1: threshold = 4 -> look for l_i>4 -> i: l_i=1 -> no.\n            Case2: threshold = 3 -> look for r_i<3 -> i: r_i=2<3 -> found, cost=10 -> candidate from Case2 is 10.\n\n        Then the answer is min(5, 10) = 5.\n\n   However, note: the total cost is 10+5 = 15? But wait, in our code we are storing the entire list of vouchers for the group, and then for i we are getting the minimal cost from the other group (which is the same group) that satisfies the condition. But note: the condition for i is satisfied by j (cost=5) and for j is satisfied by i (cost=10). \n\n   But wait: we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., the number of days they cover). This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers whose durations sum to `x`.\n\n2. **Preprocessing for Efficient Queries**: For each duration group, we preprocess two sorted lists:\n   - **By Start Day (l)**: Sorts vouchers by their start day (`l`) and prepares an array to quickly find the minimum cost among vouchers that start after a given day.\n   - **By End Day (r)**: Sorts vouchers by their end day (`r`) and prepares an array to quickly find the minimum cost among vouchers that end before a given day.\n\n3. **Query Handling**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher in the complementary duration group (i.e., `x - current_voucher_duration`) that does not overlap with it. This is done by:\n   - **Case 1**: Finding a voucher that starts after the current voucher ends (`r_i < l_j`).\n   - **Case 2**: Finding a voucher that ends before the current voucher starts (`r_j < l_i`).\n\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Using binary search on the preprocessed lists, we efficiently determine the minimal cost voucher that meets the non-overlapping condition for each case.\n\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal total cost from all valid pairs is tracked and returned. If no such pair exists, we return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = []\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    def build_structure_by_l(vouchers_list):\n        sorted_list = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        min_cost_from_right = [0] * len(sorted_list)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        idx = len(sorted_list) - 1\n        while idx >= 0:\n            if sorted_list[idx][2] < min_so_far:\n                min_so_far = sorted_list[idx][2]\n            min_cost_from_right[idx] = min_so_far\n            idx -= 1\n        return sorted_list, min_cost_from_right\n        \n    def build_structure_by_r(vouchers_list):\n        sorted_list = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        min_cost_from_left = [0] * len(sorted_list)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        idx = 0\n        while idx < len(sorted_list):\n            if sorted_list[idx][2] < min_so_far:\n                min_so_far = sorted_list[idx][2]\n            min_cost_from_left[idx] = min_so_far\n            idx += 1\n        return sorted_list, min_cost_from_left\n        \n    structures_by_l = {}\n    structures_by_r = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        lst1, arr1 = build_structure_by_l(groups[d])\n        lst2, arr2 = build_structure_by_r(groups[d])\n        structures_by_l[d] = (lst1, arr1)\n        structures_by_r[d] = (lst2, arr2)\n        \n    def query_by_l(sorted_list, min_arr, threshold):\n        low = 0\n        high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n        ans_index = len(sorted_list)\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if sorted_list[mid][0] > threshold:\n                ans_index = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        if ans_index == len(sorted_list):\n            return None\n        else:\n            return min_arr[ans_index]\n            \n    def query_by_r(sorted_list, min_arr, threshold):\n        low = 0\n        high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n        ans_index = -1\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if sorted_list[mid][1] < threshold:\n                ans_index = mid\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if ans_index == -1:\n            return None\n        else:\n            return min_arr[ans_index]\n            \n    INF = 10**18\n    best_ans = INF\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d_i = r - l + 1\n        d_j = x - d_i\n        if d_j not in structures_by_l:\n            continue\n            \n        cand1 = None\n        cand2 = None\n        \n        lst1, min_arr1 = structures_by_l[d_j]\n        if query_by_l(lst1, min_arr1, r) is not None:\n            cand1 = query_by_l(lst1, min_arr1, r)\n            \n        lst2, min_arr2 = structures_by_r[d_j]\n        if query_by_r(lst2, min_arr2, l) is not None:\n            cand2 = query_by_r(lst2, min_arr2, l)\n            \n        if cand1 is not None and cand2 is not None:\n            total = cost_val + min(cand1, cand2)\n        elif cand1 is not None:\n            total = cost_val + cand1\n        elif cand2 is not None:\n            total = cost_val + cand2\n        else:\n            continue\n            \n        if total < best_ans:\n            best_ans = total\n            \n    if best_ans == INF:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (end day - start day + 1) to facilitate efficient pair searches.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, two structures are built:\n   - **Sorted by Start Day**: Allows quick lookup of the cheapest voucher starting after a specific day.\n   - **Sorted by End Day**: Allows quick lookup of the cheapest voucher ending before a specific day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks the complementary duration group for vouchers that do not overlap.
