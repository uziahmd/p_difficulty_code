The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and all tasks with numbers less than i must be completed.\n\n However, note that the tasks might not be in increasing or decreasing order, and she can pass through houses multiple times.\n\n Observation:\n The ringroad is circular. The distance from a current house x to a target house y can be computed in two ways:\n   Option 1: Moving clockwise: \n        If y >= x: distance = y - x\n        Else: distance = (n - x) + y   [because after x we go to x+1, ... n, then 1, 2, ... until y]\n\n But note: since the road is one-way and clockwise, we cannot go counterclockwise. So the only way is clockwise.\n\n However, we can break the journey from the current position to the next task's house by going around the ring.\n\n But note: the problem says that Xenia must complete tasks in order, and the first task is given by the list.\n\n Since the tasks can be repeated and we might have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house, we can consider:\n\n Let's say we are at house `cur` (initially 1). Then for each task at house `a_i`, we need to travel from `cur` to `a_i`.\n\n How to compute the distance from `cur` to `a_i`?\n   If `a_i` >= cur: \n        d = a_i - cur\n   Else: \n        d = (n - cur) + a_i\n\n However, note: the ring is circular and we are allowed to go from cur to a_i by passing through the end (n) and then from 1 to a_i? Actually, yes.\n\n But wait: we can also consider that after n comes 1. So if we are at 3 and want to go to 2 in a ring of size 4, we can do:\n   3 -> 4 (1 step) then 4->1 (another step) then 1->2 (another step) -> total 3 steps.\n   Alternatively, we can compute: (4-3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3? But wait, that's not matching.\n\n Actually, the above formula for the else case is: (n - cur) + a_i, but that gives (4-3) + 2 = 1+2=3, which is correct.\n\n However, note that there's another way: we can also consider the entire circle as having n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n   (y - x) % n, but if negative we adjust.\n\n Alternatively, we can use modulo arithmetic. But note: we don't want modulo for negative, so:\n\n   d = (y - x) % n   doesn't work for negative because (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, but we know the distance from 3 to 2 is 3 (if we go clockwise) but wait: actually in a ring of 4, the clockwise distance from 3 to 2 is 3 (as above) and that is the minimal one-way movement.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the minimal distance in terms of both directions because the road is one-way. But wait, the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\" and the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we cannot go backwards. Therefore, the distance from x to y is always the clockwise distance, which is:\n\n   d = (y - x) if y >= x, else (y + n - x)\n\n But note: if y < x, then we go from x to n, then from 1 to y. That is (n - x) + y.\n\n However, wait: what if we are at house 3 and want to go to house 2 in a ring of 4? \n   Steps: 3 -> 4 (step 1), 4->1 (step 2), 1->2 (step 3). So 3 steps.\n\n But note: the formula (y + n - x) = 2 + 4 - 3 = 3, which matches.\n\n So the distance from x to y (when moving clockwise) is: \n   d = (y - x) % n   if y>=x then (y-x) is positive and modulo n is the same, but if y<x, then (y-x) is negative, and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road. The ring road consists of `n` houses arranged in a clockwise order, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. The movement between adjacent houses takes one unit of time, and the road is one-way (clockwise).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise. Therefore, the distance from her current position to the next task's house is calculated by considering the circular nature of the ring road. If the target house is ahead of her current position, the distance is simply the difference between the two. If the target house is behind her, she needs to move from her current position to the end of the ring road (house `n`) and then continue from house 1 to the target house.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using the formula:\n   - If the target house `a_i` is greater than or equal to the current position `cur`, the distance is `a_i - cur`.\n   - Otherwise, the distance is `(n - cur) + a_i`.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current) + a\n        current = a\n\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` is initialized to 0, and `current` is set to 1 (the starting house).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `current`, the distance is simply `a - current`.\n   - If `a` is less than `current`, the distance is `(n - current) + a`, accounting for the circular path.\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, `current` is updated to `a`, ensuring the next task starts from the correct position.\n5. **Output**: The total time taken to complete all tasks is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time required by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and processing each task in sequence, ensuring optimal performance.",
