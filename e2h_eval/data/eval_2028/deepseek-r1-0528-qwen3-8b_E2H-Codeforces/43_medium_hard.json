He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. (But note: after appending c's, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' because A provided some 'a' and B appended some 'b'.)\n 2. The string must be divided into three parts:\n    - Part1: Some number of 'a's (from the original string by A)\n    - Part2: Some number of 'b's (appended by B)\n    - Part3: Some number of 'c's (appended by C) and the condition is that the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string.\n\n However, note the process:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - B appends some number of 'b's -> so the string has only 'a's then 'b's (and at least one of each).\n   - C appends some number of 'c's, and the number of 'c's is equal to the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (in the string before C appends? Actually, note the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" But note: when C appends, the string already has the initial a's and b's. So the condition is on the entire string (without the c's) for the count of 'a' and 'b'? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n   Here, the string at the time of C's appending is the one with only 'a' and 'b'. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' are from the part that was there before C appends.\n\n   But wait: the example: \n        Input: 'aaabccc'\n        Explanation: the number of 'c' is 3, which equals the number of 'a' (which is 3). \n\n   However, note that in the entire string (after C appends) the counts change. But the problem says \"in the string\" meaning the string at the time of C's appending? \n\n   Let me re-read: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n   Since C appends to the string (which is the one with only a and b), we consider the counts of 'a' and 'b' as they are in the string at that time (so without the c's). \n\n   Therefore, if we let:\n        n_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the one in the initial part, because no 'a' is added later)\n        n_b = number of 'b' in the entire string (which is the same as the one appended by B, because no 'b' is added later)\n\n   Then the condition for C is: \n        n_c (the number of 'c's) must be equal to n_a OR n_b.\n\n   However, note that the entire string must have the following structure:\n        All the 'a's must come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n   Because A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no 'b' comes before an 'a', and no 'c' comes before an 'a' or a 'b'. In other words, the string should not contain the letter 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', similarly, 'b' should not appear after a 'c'.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Condition 1: The string must be such that the letters are grouped: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n   Condition 2: There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (so n_a >= 1, n_b >= 1).\n\n   Condition 3: The number of 'c's (n_c) must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n   But note: what if the string does not have the correct order? For example, \"bbacc\": \n        This has two 'b's, then an 'a' and then a 'c'. That breaks the order.\n\n   Therefore, we must check:\n\n        - The string should have a contiguous block of 'a's, then a contiguous block of 'b's, then a contiguous block of 'c's.\n\n   How to check the order?\n        Traverse the string and ensure that once we leave 'a' we never see 'a' again, and once we leave 'b' we never see 'b' again (unless we are in the 'c' part, but then we shouldn't see 'b' or 'a').\n\n   Alternatively, we can split the string into segments of consecutive same letters, and then check that the segments are in the order: ['a', 'b', 'c'] and that there are no more than three segments.\n\n   However, note: what if there are no 'b's? Then the string would be just 'a's and then 'c's. But the problem states that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) so we must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, the initial string by A has at least one 'a'. \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\" (meaning after B's appending). So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n   Also, note: the problem says C appends some number of 'c's. It is possible that there are zero 'c's? Then the condition for C would require that the number of 'c' (0) equals either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. But 0 is only equal to n_a if n_a=0, which is not allowed (since we must have at least one 'a'). Similarly for n_b. So if there are no 'c's, then it is not valid unless n_a=0 or n_b=0, which is forbidden. Therefore, the string might not have any 'c's and then we must say NO.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c'\". The word \"some\" usually implies at least one, but the problem does not explicitly state that. But note the condition: the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. If we allow zero, then if the string has zero 'a' or zero 'b', then zero would match. But we know we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if we have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then n_c must be at least 1 if we are to satisfy the condition? Actually, no: if n_a=0 or n_b=0, then zero would be acceptable. But we have at least one 'a' and one 'b', so n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. Then n_c must be either >=1 (if it equals n_a or n_b) but note: n_a and n_b are positive, so n_c must be positive (non-zero) to match.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"some number\", which in programming problems often includes zero? But the example doesn't mention zero. Let's look at the condition: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', then the number of 'c' must be at least 1 (because the smallest positive number is 1, and if we set n_c=0 then 0 != n_a (which is at least 1) and 0 != n_b (which is at least 1)). So we must have at least one 'c' if the condition is to hold? Actually, no: the condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'\", and the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive, so n_c must be positive. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? \n\n   But note: the example input does not necessarily have to have a 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. The word \"some\" might imply at least one, but the problem does not explicitly say. However, the condition requires that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b' (which are positive). So if the string has no 'c', then n_c=0, and 0 is not equal to a positive n_a or n_b. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c' if the condition is to hold.\n\n   However, wait: what if the string does not have any 'c'? Then the condition fails. So we can say: the string must have the form [a...][b...][c...] (with at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c')?\n\n   But note: the problem says that B appends some number of 'b' (at least one) and C appends some number of 'c' (which by the condition must be positive because the existing counts of 'a' and 'b' are positive). So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? \n\n   However, let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\"\n\n        Then C appends some number of 'c'. The condition for C is about the string (with only a and b) at that time.\n\n   So the entire string (with the c's) must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and the condition for C requires that the number of c's is positive (unless the condition is met by 0, but 0 isn't positive). \n\n   Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aabc\"? \n        Example input: ['aabc'] -> output: YES.\n\n        Counts: \n            n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1.\n        Condition: n_c (1) is equal to n_b (1) -> yes.\n\n        And the order: 'a','a','b','c' -> valid.\n\n   Another example: \"aaabccc\": \n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition holds (3 == 3) and order is valid.\n\n   Now, what about a string that does not follow the order? e.g., \"abbac\": \n        This has 'a' after 'c' -> invalid.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Check the order: the string must be non-decreasing in the sense of the letters: \n        - Once we see a 'b', we cannot see an 'a' again.\n        - Once we see a 'c', we cannot see an 'a' or a 'b' again.\n\n      We can do:\n        Let i = 0\n        While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If we reached the end, then the order is valid.\n\n   2. Check that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (since the condition for C requires at least one 'c' and the problem states at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n   3. Count the numbers: \n        n_a = count of 'a'\n        n_b = count of 'b'\n        n_c = count of 'c'\n\n   4. Check that n_c is either n_a or n_b.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for C is based on the string at the time of appending, which is the string without the 'c's. But note: the string without the 'c's is the same as the original string (with only 'a' and 'b')? Actually, no: the problem says that C appends the 'c's to the string (which already has the 'a' and 'b'). The counts of 'a' and 'b' at the time of C's appending are the same as the total counts because no 'a' or 'b' is appended after. So we can use the total counts of 'a' and 'b' (since the entire string has the same counts for 'a' and 'b' as the string that C sees).\n\n   Therefore, condition 4: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n   But note: what if the string has no 'b'? Then the order condition would break because we are expecting to have a block of 'b's. Similarly, if there is no 'a', that breaks the first condition.\n\n   However, we have already checked that the string is in the order [a's][b's][c's] and we require at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement) and one 'c' (from the condition). \n\n   But wait: the problem says the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the initial part). We don't explicitly check for 'c' in the problem statement, but the condition for C requires that the number of 'c' is positive (because n_a and n_b are positive, so n_c must be positive). Therefore, we must have at least one 'c'.\n\n   So the steps:\n\n   Step 1: Check the order: \n        We traverse the string and check that the letters are non-decreasing in the order 'a', then 'b', then 'c'.\n\n        We can do:\n            s = input string\n            i = 0\n            # Read all 'a's\n            while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read all 'b's\n            while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read all 'c's\n            while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            If i < len(s): then the order is broken.\n\n   Step 2: Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (But note: the order check might have broken if we don't have at least one 'a' and one 'b'? Actually, the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' from the initial part. However, our order check requires that we have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because we are reading the 'a's and then the 'b's). But what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then we break at the first while and then the second while fails (so i remains at the end of 'a's) and then the third while also fails. Then we break the order because we didn't read any 'b' or 'c'. \n\n   Alternatively, we can check the presence of the letters after the order check? Actually, the order check will fail if the string is not in the form [a...][b...][c...]. But the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b', so we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The order check requires that after the 'a's we have 'b's and then 'c's.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the string has a non-empty block of 'b's? Actually, the problem says B appends some number of 'b's, so at least one. Similarly, C appends some number of 'c's (which must be positive because the condition requires matching positive counts). \n\n   But wait: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. We don't know the counts until we count. However, if the string does not have a 'b' block, then the order check will break.\n\n   Actually, the order check must break if we see an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c'. \n\n   Step 3: Count the letters.\n\n   Step 4: Check that the counts of 'a' is at least 1, 'b' at least 1, and 'c' at least 1 (this is implied by the condition for C: since n_c must be positive, and the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n   Step 5: Check that n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n   However, note: the entire string is built from the initial a's, then b's, then c's. The counts we have are the total counts.\n\n   Example: \"aabc\" -> \n        Order: \n            Start with 'a' -> then next is 'a' -> then 'b' -> then 'c'. Valid.\n        Counts: n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> 1==1 (n_c == n_b) -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaabccc\" -> \n        Order: valid.\n        Counts: n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> 3==3 (n_c==n_a) -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"bbacc\" -> \n        Order: \n            First character is 'b' -> breaks the first while (we were expecting only 'a' then 'b' then 'c')? \n            Actually, we start by reading 'a's: the first char is 'b', so we break immediately. Then we read 'b's: we read the two 'b's. Then we try to read 'c's: we read the first 'c'. Then we have an 'a' left. This breaks the order.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the string \"bbacc\" has the pattern: \n            Start: 'b' -> but we haven't seen any 'a' yet? The problem says A gives a string of 'a's and then B appends 'b's. So the string must start with at least one 'a'. \n\n        Therefore, the order check must also ensure that the first segment is non-empty (at least one 'a') and the second segment (if exists) is non-empty (at least one 'b') and the third segment (if exists) is non-empty (at least one 'c').\n\n   However, the problem says \"A has a string consisting of some number of 'a'\", meaning at least one. Then B appends some number of 'b' (at least one). Then C appends some number of 'c' (at least one, because the condition requires matching positive counts). \n\n   Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n   But note: what if the string is \"aab\"? \n        Then n_c=0 -> condition fails (since we need n_c to be either n_a (2) or n_b (1) and 0 is not 2 or 1). So we output NO.\n\n   However, according to the problem, the string \"aab\" was obtained by A giving \"aa\", then B appending \"b\", and then C did not append any 'c'? But the problem says C appends some number of 'c' (which we assume means at least one) and the condition must hold. So \"aab\" is invalid.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. If C appends zero 'c', then the condition would require that 0 equals the number of 'a' (which is 2) or the number of 'b' (which is 1). That fails. So we must have at least one 'c'.\n\n   Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        # Check the order: \n        n = len(s)\n        i = 0\n\n        # Read all 'a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Now, if we haven't seen any 'a', then the string starts with 'b' or 'c' -> invalid.\n        if i == 0: \n            # No 'a' found, but we need at least one 'a'\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now read all 'b's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n\n        # We must have read at least one 'b'\n        if i == n: \n            # Then we didn't read any 'b' and we are at the end, but we must have at least one 'b'\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now read all 'c's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        # After reading, if we haven't reached the end, then there are invalid characters or wrong order.\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'. But note: the above while loops have read the entire string in three parts, so the counts of each letter are the length of the part.\n\n        # But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? Then the above works.\n\n        # Now, count the letters? Actually, we can use the entire string's counts.\n\n        n_a = s.count('a')\n        n_b = s.count('b')\n        n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        # But note: the above order check ensures the string is in the form [a...][b...][c...]\n\n        # Check the condition for C: n_c must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\"?\n        n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> valid.\n\n   But consider: \"aaaabbbbcccc\": n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4 -> valid.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aaaabbbbc\": \n        Order: valid (starts with 'a's, then 'b's, then one 'c')\n        n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=1 -> 1 is neither 4 nor 4 -> NO.\n\n   What if the string is \"aaaabbb\"? \n        Then the third while loop doesn't read anything (so i remains at the end of 'b's). Then we check: i==n -> so we break the third while loop normally. But then we check the condition: n_c = 0 -> 0 is not 4 nor 4 -> NO.\n\n   But wait: the condition for C requires that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the string has no 'c', then it fails.\n\n   However, note: the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. The word \"some\" might be ambiguous, but the condition requires that the number is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the string has 4 'a' and 4 'b', then the number of 'c' must be 4 or 4 (so 4). But we have 0, so invalid.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" with n_c=3? \n        Then 3 != 4 -> invalid.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In the entire string (without the c's) the counts are the same as the total? Yes, because the string is built from the initial a's and b's and then c's are appended. The counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed.\n\n   But note: the problem says that the number of 'c' is appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string (at the time of appending). The string at the time of appending is \"aaaabbb\", which has 4 'a' and 4 'b'. So the condition is that the number of 'c' must be 4 (because 4 is the count of 'a' and also 4 is the count of 'b'). Therefore, we must have 4 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, the above algorithm is correct.\n\n   However, there is an alternative scenario: what if the string does not have the three segments? For example, if the string is \"ab\", then we break the third while loop (no 'c') and then we check: n_c=0 -> invalid. Correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that C appends some number of 'c'. The condition must hold. So if the string is \"ab\", then the condition for C is that the number of 'c' (which is 0) must be equal to the number of 'a' (1) or the number of 'b' (1). 0 != 1 and 0 != 1 -> invalid.\n\n   Another example: \"a\" -> invalid because no 'b' and no 'c'. Our order check: \n        We read 'a' (so i becomes 1) then we try to read 'b' -> fails (i=1, then we break the second while) and then we check: i==1, then we break the second while and then we enter the condition for the second while: if i==n? n=1, so i==n -> then we break and say \"NO\" because we didn't read any 'b'? Actually, wait:\n\n        Steps for \"a\":\n            i=0: read 'a' -> i becomes 1.\n            Then we enter the second while: i=1, s[1] doesn't exist -> skip the second while.\n            Then we check: if i==n? n=1, so i==n -> then we break and say \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the problem requires at least one 'b' (from B's appending). So we must have at least one 'b'. Therefore, \"a\" is invalid.\n\n   But note: the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the string \"a\" is invalid.\n\n   However, the problem says the string is given to you. We assume the string is built by the process. \n\n   One more edge case: what if the string is \"abc\"? \n        n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> valid.\n\n   But wait: the condition for C: n_c (1) must be equal to n_a (1) or n_b (1) -> yes.\n\n   However, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c'. The string \"abc\" has one 'c'. The condition is met.\n\n   But note: the order: \n        First: 'a' -> valid, then 'b' -> valid, then 'c' -> valid.\n\n   So \"abc\" is YES.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aac\"? \n        Order: \n            Read 'a's: two 'a's -> then we try to read 'b's: none, so we break the second while. Then we read 'c's: one 'c'. \n        Then we check: \n            n_a=2, n_b=0, n_c=1 -> but wait, we did not read any 'b'. The problem requires at least one 'b'. \n\n        But our order check: \n            After reading two 'a's, we break and then we try to read 'b's: we don't find any, so i remains at index 2 (the last 'a'). Then we read 'c's: we read the 'c' at index2? Actually, no: the string \"aac\" has indices 0,1,2: \n                s[0]='a', s[1]='a', s[2]='c'\n\n            After the first while, i=2. Then the second while: s[2] is 'c', not 'b', so the second while breaks. Then the third while: s[2]=='c' -> so we read one 'c'. Then i becomes 3, which is the end.\n\n            Then we check: i==3, which is the length, so we proceed.\n\n            But then we check the counts: \n                n_a = 2, n_b = 0, n_c=1.\n\n            The condition: n_c==n_a -> 1==2? no. n_c==n_b -> 1==0? no. -> NO.\n\n        However, the problem requires that the string has at least one 'b' (from B's appending). So we should have failed earlier.\n\n        But our order check did not check for the presence of 'b'. We only checked that the order is [a's][b's][c's] and that we didn't have leftover characters. However, we did not check that the second segment (the 'b's) is non-empty. \n\n        How to enforce that we have at least one 'b'? \n\n        We can modify the order check: after the second while, we must have read at least one character (so the second segment exists). Similarly, the first segment must have at least one, and the third segment must have at least one.\n\n        But note: the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the initial part). The order check does not check the existence of the segments, only the order. \n\n        We can adjust:\n\n        Step 1: Check the order and also check that the segments are non-empty for 'a' and 'b'. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check the counts of 'a' and 'b' and 'c' and then also check that the order is correct.\n\n        However, the problem requires at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (because the condition for C requires at least one 'c' and the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'). \n\n        Therefore, we must have n_a>=1, n_b>=1, n_c>=1.\n\n        Then, we can simply:\n\n        - Check the order (without checking the non-empty of the segments by the while loops, because if the string does not have a 'b' then the second while loop won't run, but we are going to check the counts anyway).\n\n        But wait: the problem says the string is built by the process. We must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\n        We can do:\n\n        After the order check, we know the string is in the form [a...][b...][c...]. Then we count the letters. Then we check:\n\n            if n_a>=1 and n_b>=1 and n_c>=1 and (n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, the order check already ensures that the string is in the right order. \n\n        But note: the order check might break if we have an empty segment? \n\n        Example: \"a\" -> \n            First while: reads one 'a', then second while: nothing, then third while: nothing. Then we check i (which is 1) and the length is 1 -> so i==n, then we proceed to count: n_a=1, n_b=0, n_c=0 -> fails the condition (n_b>=1 and n_c>=1) -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccc\": \n            n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbbc\": \n            n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=1 -> 1 is not 4 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbb\": \n            n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aab\": \n            n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=0 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"abc\": \n            n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\": \n            n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\": \n            n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"bbacc\": \n            Order check: \n                Start: first char 'b' -> first while breaks (i remains 0). Then we try to read 'b's: we read two 'b's -> i becomes 2. Then we read 'c': one 'c' -> i becomes 3. Then we see an 'a' at index 3 -> the third while breaks (because we are at 'c' and then we break) and then we check i (3) is not equal to the length (5) -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the string \"bbacc\" has length 5. The third while: \n            After the two 'b's, we are at index 2. Then we read the 'c' at index2? Actually, the string \"bbacc\": \n                index0: 'b'\n                index1: 'b'\n                index2: 'a' -> wait, that breaks the order.\n\n        Actually, I think I made a mistake in the example \"bbacc\": \n            The string is \"bbacc\": \n                First while: looks for 'a' -> fails, so i remains 0.\n                Second while: reads from index0: 'b' -> then index1: 'b' -> then index2: 'a' -> so the second while breaks at index2 (i becomes 2). Then third while: starts at index2: 'a' -> not 'c', so breaks. Then i=2, which is less than 5 -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        i = 0\n\n        # Read all 'a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Now read all 'b's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Now read all 'c's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        # If we haven't traversed the whole string, then the order is broken.\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Count the letters\n        n_a = s.count('a')\n        n_b = s.count('b')\n        n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        # Check the conditions: at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c' and the condition for C.\n        if n_a >= 1 and n_b >= 1 and n_c >= 1 and (n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: what if the string is \"ac\"? \n        Order check: \n            First while: reads the 'a' (i becomes 1). Then second while: s[1] is 'c' -> doesn't read any 'b'. Then third while: reads the 'c' (i becomes 2). Then i==2, which is the length -> valid order.\n\n        Then counts: n_a=1, n_b=0, n_c=1 -> fails the condition (n_b>=1 is false) -> NO.\n\n   This is correct because the problem requires at least one 'b' (from B's appending).\n\n   But note: the problem says that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the initial part). So the above code correctly rejects strings that do not have at least one 'b' (even if the order is correct and the condition for C holds by accident, we must have at least one 'b').\n\n   However, what if the string is \"abb\"? \n        Order: valid (two 'b's then no 'c') -> then counts: n_a=1, n_b=2, n_c=0 -> fails (n_c>=1 is false) -> NO.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"a\"? \n        Order: \n            Reads one 'a', then no 'b', then no 'c' -> i becomes 1, which is the length -> valid order? Then counts: n_a=1, n_b=0, n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends some 'c's such that the number of 'c's equals either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending 'c's. The solution involves checking the string's structure and counts of characters to ensure it meets all specified conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. This ensures the string follows the sequence imposed by the problem's construction process.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n\n    # Read all 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n\n    # Read all 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n\n    # Read all 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n\n    # If the entire string isn't traversed, the order is invalid\n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Count the letters\n    n_a = s.count('a')\n    n_b = s.count('b')\n    n_c = s.count('c')\n\n    # Check for minimum counts and condition on 'c'\n    if n_a >= 1 and n_b >= 1 and n_c >= 1 and (n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ends with 'c's. This is done by incrementing an index `i` through the string while processing each segment of characters in order.\n2. **Character Count Validation**: After ensuring the string structure is correct, the code counts the occurrences of each character. It then checks if there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Condition Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are satisfied, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's compliance with the problem's requirements by leveraging simple loops and conditional checks.",
