He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, but note that C appends c's and the condition on the number of c's is defined in terms of the current counts of a and b).\n 2. The string should be split into three parts:\n    - Part1: Some number of 'a's (at least one) at the beginning.\n    - Part2: Some number of 'b's (at least one) immediately after the 'a's.\n    - Part3: Some number of 'c's (could be zero? but note: the problem says C appends some number of c's, but also the condition requires at least one a and one b from A and B. However, note the example: \"aabc\" has two a's, one b, and one c. Also note: the problem says that after C appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But the original string from A and B already has at least one a and one b, so if C appends 0 c's, then the condition for C is not met because the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", meaning at least one? Actually, the problem says \"appends some number\", which can be zero? Let me check the example.\n\n However, looking at the examples: \n   Example 1: 'aaabccc' -> valid, and it has c's.\n   Example 2: 'bbacc' -> invalid because the order is broken (there's a 'a' after 'b'? Actually, the problem states:\n        A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n So the expected structure is: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n Therefore, if we break the string into three contiguous segments (possibly empty? but note condition: at least one a and one b exist, so the first segment must have at least one a and the second at least one b) then the third segment (c's) can be zero? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and then the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (or both). However, if there are no c's, then the condition would require 0 = (#a) or 0 = (#b). Since we have at least one a and one b, then 0 cannot equal either. So the string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem does not explicitly say that the appended number is positive, but note: \"some number\" usually allows zero? However, the condition for C: the number of c's equals the count of a or b. If we have zero c's, then we require 0 == count(a) or 0 == count(b). But since we have at least one a and one b, this fails. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'?\n\n However, note the example: the problem says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.\" So the condition is satisfied by having at least one c.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string is non-decreasing in the sense: first all a's, then all b's, then all c's. (i.e., no 'a' after 'b', no 'b' after 'c', and no 'c' after anything else).\n\n 2. Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n 3. Conditions:\n    a. The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: [a's] [b's] [c's]. \n        This means: \n          - All the a's must come first, then all the b's, then all the c's.\n        We can traverse until we find a non-'a', then from there until we find a non-'b', then the rest must be 'c'.\n\n    b. The counts must satisfy: \n        Let na = count('a'), nb = count('b'), nc = count('c')\n        Then, nc must be either na or nb (or both).\n\n 4. But note: the problem says that the entire string is built as:\n        A gives a string of 'a's (so the initial part is all a's, at least one)\n        Then B appends some 'b's (so the next part is all b's, at least one)\n        Then C appends some 'c's (so the last part is all c's",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific sequence of operations described. The operations involve appending 'b's and then 'c's to an initial string of 'a's, with certain constraints on the counts of these characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of three contiguous segments: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, and finally all 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's (na), 'b's (nb), and 'c's (nc) in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: The number of 'c's (nc) must be equal to either the number of 'a's (na) or the number of 'b's (nb), or both. Additionally, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string is in the form \"a...ab...bc...c\"\n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    # Traverse until non-'a' is found\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Traverse until non-'b' is found after 'a's\n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    # Traverse the rest which should be 'c's\n    k = j\n    while k < n:\n        if s[k] != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        k += 1\n        \n    # Now, check the counts\n    na = s.count('a')\n    nb = s.count('b')\n    nc = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Ensure at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    if na == 0 or nb == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check the condition for 'c'\n    if nc == na or nc == nb:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, and ends with zero or more 'c's. This is done by traversing the string until a different character is encountered.\n2. **Count Validation**: After verifying the order, the code counts the occurrences of each character. It ensures there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's (or both) for the string to be valid.\n3. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"YES\" if all conditions are met, otherwise it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the structural and count-based constraints required by the problem, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
