In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in one line, but the example input is given as a list of three strings. However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\". Each string is a tile? Actually, the example input is given as:\n Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input format is actually three tiles in a single line, separated by spaces? Or is it three separate lines? The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three strings? Or three tokens?\n\n Looking at the example: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing because the example input is shown as three separate examples. Actually, the problem states that the input is three strings (each representing a tile) in one line? Or wait, let me read again.\n\n Actually, the example input is provided as three separate examples, but the problem says:\n\n Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n So, the input is one line with three strings, each string being two characters: e.g., \"1s\", \"9m\", etc.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three examples. The problem says:\n\n Example Input:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is probably meant to be three test cases? Or is there only one test case? Actually, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input and output.\n\n However, note: the sample input has three lines of three tiles each? Or is it one line containing three tiles?\n\n Let me check the example output: \n   Output: ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This implies that the input has three separate test cases. But the problem says \"The only line\" for the input. \n\n Clarification from the problem statement: \n   \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n So, if we have one test case, then the input is one line with three tiles, each tile represented as two-character string.\n\n However, the example input is given as three examples. It might be that the problem expects multiple test cases? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Actually, looking at the problem statement again: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem description. Then the example input is given as:\n\n Input:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input is written in a list form. This is just how the problem is presented. In reality, we are to assume that the input is one line with three two-character strings.\n\n However, the example output is also given as a list of three integers.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\n And the example: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s'] -> Output: 0\n   Input: ['9m 9m 9m'] -> Output: 0\n   Input: ['3p 9m 2p'] -> Output: 1\n\n But note: the problem says \"The only line contains three strings\", so in one run of the program, we get one line with three two-character strings.\n\n However, the example input is given as three separate examples. This means that the problem likely expects you to handle one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the problem does not specify the number of test cases. The example input is shown as three examples, but the actual input format is one test case.\n\n I think the confusion comes from the way the example is presented. The intended meaning is:\n\n Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\" (one line with three tiles) -> Output: 0\n Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\" (one line with three tiles) -> Output: 0\n Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\" (one line with three tiles) -> Output: 1\n\n So, our program should read one line, split it into three two-character strings, and then compute the answer for that set of three tiles.\n\n Steps:\n\n We have three tiles. We can consider two types of mentsu: koutsu (three same tiles) and shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n Since we are allowed to draw any tiles (and we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m]).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n   - Given three tiles, we need to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, we consider drawing additional tiles to form one.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the three tiles already form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n   - **Drawing Tiles**: If no mentsu is found, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a mentsu. This involves considering both possible types (koutsu and shuntsu) and the most efficient way to complete them.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: If all three tiles are identical, no draws are needed (0 draws).\n   - **Sequence Check**: For a sequence, check if the numbers can be rearranged to form three consecutive numbers (considering wrap-around is not allowed, e.g., [9m, 1m, 2m] is invalid).\n   - **Drawing Calculation**: \n     - For a triplet, if two tiles are identical, drawing one more of the same tile completes the triplet.\n     - For a sequence, if two tiles are part of a potential sequence, drawing the missing tile completes it. If no sequence is possible, more draws might be needed, but since we only have three tiles initially, the maximum required is 2 draws (to form a triplet with two identical tiles).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple checks and comparisons, making it efficient with constant time complexity O(1), as the number of tiles is fixed at three.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    def same_tile(t1, t2):\n        return t1 == t2\n    \n    def is_triplet(tiles):\n        return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n    \n    def is_sequence(tiles):\n        suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n        nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n        \n        if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n            return False\n            \n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        if sorted_nums[0] + 1 == sorted_nums[1] and sorted_nums[1] + 1 == sorted_nums[2]:\n            return True\n        \n        # Check if there is any duplicate?

Now, we are breaking by suit.\n\n    # Another option: maybe we can form a triplet by drawing one tile (if two are same in a suit) or a sequence by drawing one tile (if two numbers are consecutive in the same suit).\n\n    # But note: the above calculation for sequences might not cover all cases. Let me simplify.\n\n    # Since we only have three tiles, the minimal draws can be 0 (already a mentsu), or 1, or 2.\n\n    # We already considered 0. Now, let's check for 1 or 2.\n\n    # Actually, the above code for sequences was incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the sequence must be three consecutive numbers. \n    # Let me rework the sequence part:\n\n    # We'll consider each suit separately. For a given suit, we have up to three numbers. We want to know if by adding one tile we can form a sequence.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can think: \n    #   What are the possible sequences? They are (n, n+1, n+2) for n from 1 to 7.\n\n    # For each possible sequence, check if at least two of the three tiles are present in the hand (and in the correct suit). Then, drawing the missing one would complete the sequence.\n\n    # But note: we can only draw one tile. So for each possible sequence (for each suit), check if two of the three numbers are present in the hand (in that suit). Then, we can complete the sequence with one draw.\n\n    # Similarly, for triplets: if two tiles of the same suit and number are present, then drawing one more completes the triplet.\n\n    # So, we can do:\n\n    # Check for triplets with one draw: \n    #   For each suit, count the frequency of each number. If any number appears at least twice, then one draw completes a triplet.\n\n    # Check for sequences with one draw:\n    #   For each suit, for each possible starting number n (from 1 to 7), check if the numbers n, n+1, n+2 are present (each at least once) in the hand (for that suit). But wait, we can only draw one tile, so we need exactly two of these three numbers already in the hand (in that suit). Then, drawing the third completes the sequence.\n\n    # However, note: the hand has exactly three tiles. So if we break down by suit, we might have multiple suits. But sequences must be in the same suit.\n\n    # Revised plan for one-draw checks:\n\n    # Triplets: \n    #   For each suit, if there are at least two tiles with the same number, then one draw of that tile completes the triplet.\n\n    # Sequences:\n    #   For each suit, for each n from 1 to 7, check if two out of {n, n+1, n+2} are present in the hand (for that suit). Then, one draw of the missing number completes the sequence.\n\n    # But note: the hand might have two tiles of the same number, but that doesn't help for a sequence unless they are part of a sequence. \n\n    # However, the above triplet condition is independent.\n\n    # Let's recalculate min_draws:\n\n    # Check for triplet with one draw:\n    for suit in set(suits):\n        freq = {}\n        for i in range(3):\n            if suits[i] == suit:\n                num = nums[i]\n                freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1\n        for num, cnt in freq.items():\n            if cnt >= 2:\n                min_draws = 1\n                break\n        if min_draws == 1:\n            break\n\n    if min_draws == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Now, check for sequence with one draw:\n    for suit in set(suits):\n        # Get all distinct numbers in this suit\n        numbers = set()\n        for i in range(3):\n            if suits[i] == suit:\n                numbers.add(nums[i])\n                \n        # Check for each possible sequence (n, n+1, n+2) in this suit\n        for n in range(1, 8):\n            seq = {n, n+1, n+2}\n            present = seq & numbers\n            if len(present) == 2:\n                min_draws = 1\n                break\n        if min_draws == 1:\n            break\n\n    if min_draws == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # If not 0 or 1, then we need to consider 2 draws.\n    # Possibilities:\n    #   - Form a triplet: if we have two different pairs of same tiles (but we only have three tiles, so two pairs must be of the same tile? Actually, three tiles: two of one kind and one of another -> then drawing one of the first kind forms a triplet. But we already checked for one draw above. So if we get here, we didn't find a one-draw solution.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, we might have three distinct tiles, none forming a sequence or triplet. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (if two tiles are same, we already handled). Or form a sequence by drawing two tiles? But note, we can also form a triplet by drawing two of a kind if we have one tile of that kind (then drawing two more makes three). But wait, we have three tiles. If we have one tile, then we need two draws. But if we have two tiles of the same kind, then one draw suffices (already handled). So if we have one tile of a kind, then we need two draws to complete a triplet. However, we might also form a sequence by drawing two tiles.\n    #\n    # Actually, the minimal draws could be 2 in some cases, but note: with three tiles, we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles if we have at least one tile (because we can choose a tile that is not present, then draw two of that tile). However, is that minimal? Maybe we can form a sequence with two draws? But the problem asks for the minimum number.\n\n    # Let's consider: \n    #   If we have three distinct tiles, none forming a sequence or triplet, then:\n    #       - To form a triplet: we need to draw two of the same tile (if we have one tile, then two draws; if we have two tiles, then one draw — but we don't have two same tiles, so one tile per kind). So if we have one tile of kind A, then two draws of A will make a triplet.\n    #       - To form a sequence: we need to draw two tiles to complete a sequence. But note, we might have two tiles that are part of a sequence. For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 4m], then to form a sequence we need to draw 3m (then we have [1m,2m,3m]) — that's one draw. But wait, we already checked for one-draw sequences above. So if we got here, there was no one-draw solution. Therefore, we must consider two-draw solutions.\n\n    # Actually, our one-draw sequence check should have caught the case where two of the three consecutive numbers are present. In the example [1m, 2m, 4m], the sequence (1,2,3) has two numbers (1 and 2) present, so it should have been caught by the one-draw sequence check.\n\n    # Therefore, if we reach this point, it means no one-draw solution exists. Then the answer must be 2, because we can always form a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (even if the tile is not present at all, we can draw two of it).\n\n    # But wait, what if we have two tiles of the same kind? Then one draw suffices (already handled). So if we have three distinct tiles, each appearing once, then we need two draws to form a triplet (draw two of one of them).\n\n    # However, note: we might be able to form a sequence with two draws? For example, if we have [1m, 1m, 2m] — but wait, we don't have three distinct tiles. Let me clarify: the hand has three tiles. The possibilities are:\n    #   Case 1: All three same -> 0 draws.\n    #   Case 2: Two same, one different -> one draw (for triplet) if the two same can be completed, or one draw for sequence? Actually, two same tiles can be part of a sequence only if the sequence requires that number. But we already checked for one-draw triplet and sequence.\n\n    # Since we are here, the hand does not contain any two same tiles (otherwise we would have printed 1). And no sequence of two consecutive numbers in the same suit (otherwise we would have printed 1). Therefore, the hand must have three distinct tiles, each appearing once, and either:\n    #   - All three tiles are of different suits, then we cannot form a sequence (since sequence requires same suit) and we cannot form a triplet (since no duplicate). Then we need two draws (draw two of one of the tiles to form a triplet).\n    #   - Or, they are in the same suit, but no two form a consecutive sequence and no triplet. Then we can form a sequence by drawing one tile? But we already checked for one-draw sequence. So actually, if they are in the same suit, we should have found a one-draw sequence or triplet.\n\n    # Therefore, the remaining case is when the tiles are of different suits. Then, we cannot form a sequence (since sequences require same suit) and we cannot form a triplet (since no duplicates). Then the minimal draws is 2 (draw two tiles of any kind to form a triplet).\n\n    # However, wait: what if we draw two tiles to form a sequence? But sequences require three consecutive numbers in the same suit. With two draws, we can change the suit? No, we can only draw any tile. But if we draw two tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers, then we might form a sequence. However, the problem allows drawing any tiles, so we can choose the best option.\n\n    # Actually, the minimal number of draws is 2 because we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (which is allowed). \n\n    # But note: we might be able to form a sequence with two draws if we have two tiles in the same suit that are two apart? For example, [1m, 3m] and we draw 2m. But wait, we have three tiles. The hand might be [1m, 3m, something else]. Then to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m], we need to draw 2m. That's one draw. But we already checked for one-draw sequences.\n\n    # Since we are here, we did not find a one-draw solution. So the answer must be 2.\n\n    # However, let me confirm: \n    #   Example: ['1m', '2p', '3s'] — three distinct tiles, different suits, no duplicates, and no sequence possible. Then we need to draw two tiles. We can draw two '1m' to form a triplet, or draw any other combination. So the answer is 2.\n\n    # Therefore, we output 2.\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as a single line and split into three two-character strings, each representing a tile.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If all three tiles are identical, the answer is 0 because a triplet is already formed.\n3. **Sequence Check**: If the three tiles form a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit), the answer is 0.\n4. **One-Draw Check**: \n   - **Triplet**: If there are at least two tiles of the same suit and number, drawing one more tile completes the triplet.\n   - **Sequence**: If two of the three consecutive numbers in any suit are present, drawing the missing tile completes the sequence.\n5. **Two-Draw Check**: If no one-draw solution is found, the minimal draws required is 2, which can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of any existing tile.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu with minimal draws, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",

Then, we can complete the sequence with one draw.\n\n    # Similarly, for triplets: if two tiles of the same suit and number are present, then drawing one more completes the triplet.\n\n    # So, we can do:\n\n    # Check for triplets with one draw: \n    #   For each suit, count the frequency of each number.

But wait, we can only draw one tile, so we need exactly two of these three numbers already in the hand (in that suit). Then, drawing the third completes the sequence.\n\n    # However, note: the hand has exactly three tiles. So if we break down by suit, we might have multiple suits.

Then, one draw of the missing number completes the sequence.\n\n    # But note: the hand might have two tiles of the same number, but that doesn't help for a sequence unless they are part of a sequence. \n\n    # However, the above triplet condition is independent.\n\n    # Let's recalculate min_draws:\n\n    # Check for triplet with one draw:\n    for suit in set(suits):\n        freq = {}\n        for i in range(3):\n            if suits[i] == suit:\n                num = nums[i]\n                freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1\n        for num, cnt in freq.items():\n            if cnt >= 2:\n                min_draws = 1\n                break\n        if min_draws == 1:\n            break\n\n    if min_draws == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Now, check for sequence with one draw:\n    for suit in set(suits):\n        # Get all distinct numbers in this suit\n        numbers = set()\n        for i in range(3):\n            if suits[i] == suit:\n                numbers.add(nums[i])\n                \n        # Check for each possible sequence (n, n+1, n+2) in this suit\n        for n in range(1, 8):\n            seq = {n, n+1, n+2}\n            present = seq & numbers\n            if len(present) == 2:\n                min_draws = 1\n                break\n        if min_draws == 1:\n            break\n\n    if min_draws == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # If not 0 or 1, then we need to consider 2 draws.\n    # Possibilities:\n    #   - Form a triplet: if we have two different pairs of same tiles (but we only have three tiles, so two pairs must be of the same tile? Actually, three tiles: two of one kind and one of another -> then drawing one of the first kind forms a triplet. But we already checked for one draw above. So if we get here, we didn't find a one-draw solution.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, we might have three distinct tiles, none forming a sequence or triplet. Then we can form a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (if two tiles are same, we already handled). Or form a sequence by drawing two tiles? But note, we can also form a triplet by drawing two of a kind if we have one tile of that kind (then drawing two more makes three). But wait, we have three tiles. If we have one tile, then we need two draws. But if we have two tiles of the same kind, then one draw suffices (already handled). So if we have one tile of a kind, then we need two draws to complete a triplet. However, we might also form a sequence by drawing two tiles.\n    #\n    # Actually, the minimal draws could be 2 in some cases, but note: with three tiles, we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles if we have at least one tile (because we can choose a tile that is not present, then draw two of that tile). However, is that minimal? Maybe we can form a sequence with two draws? But the problem asks for the minimum number.\n\n    # Let's consider: \n    #   If we have three distinct tiles, none forming a sequence or triplet, then:\n    #       - To form a triplet: we need to draw two of the same tile (if we have one tile, then two draws; if we have two tiles, then one draw — but we don't have two same tiles, so one tile per kind). So if we have one tile of kind A, then two draws of A will make a triplet.\n    #       - To form a sequence: we need to draw two tiles to complete a sequence. But note, we might have two tiles that are part of a sequence. For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 4m], then to form a sequence we need to draw 3m (then we have [1m,2m,3m]) — that's one draw. But wait, we already checked for one-draw sequences above. So if we got here, there was no one-draw solution. Therefore, we must consider two-draw solutions.\n\n    # Actually, our one-draw sequence check should have caught the case where two of the three consecutive numbers are present. In the example [1m, 2m, 4m], the sequence (1,2,3) has two numbers (1 and 2) present, so it should have been caught by the one-draw sequence check.\n\n    # Therefore, if we reach this point, it means no one-draw solution exists. Then the answer must be 2, because we can always form a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (even if the tile is not present at all, we can draw two of it).\n\n    # But wait, what if we have two tiles of the same kind? Then one draw suffices (already handled). So if we have three distinct tiles, each appearing once, then we need two draws to form a triplet (draw two of one of them).\n\n    # However, note: we might be able to form a sequence with two draws? For example, if we have [1m, 1m, 2m] — but wait, we don't have three distinct tiles. Let me clarify: the hand has three tiles. The possibilities are:\n    #   Case 1: All three same -> 0 draws.\n    #   Case 2: Two same, one different -> one draw (for triplet) if the two same can be completed, or one draw for sequence? Actually, two same tiles can be part of a sequence only if the sequence requires that number. But we already checked for one-draw triplet and sequence.\n\n    # Since we are here, the hand does not contain any two same tiles (otherwise we would have printed 1). And no sequence of two consecutive numbers in the same suit (otherwise we would have printed 1). Therefore, the hand must have three distinct tiles, each appearing once, and either:\n    #   - All three tiles are of different suits, then we cannot form a sequence (since sequence requires same suit) and we cannot form a triplet (since no duplicate). Then we need two draws (draw two of one of the tiles to form a triplet).\n    #   - Or, they are in the same suit, but no two form a consecutive sequence and no triplet. Then we can form a sequence by drawing one tile? But we already checked for one-draw sequence. So actually, if they are in the same suit, we should have found a one-draw sequence or triplet.\n\n    # Therefore, the remaining case is when the tiles are of different suits. Then, we cannot form a sequence (since sequences require same suit) and we cannot form a triplet (since no duplicates). Then the minimal draws is 2 (draw two tiles of any kind to form a triplet).\n\n    # However, wait: what if we draw two tiles to form a sequence? But sequences require three consecutive numbers in the same suit. With two draws, we can change the suit? No, we can only draw any tile. But if we draw two tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers, then we might form a sequence. However, the problem allows drawing any tiles, so we can choose the best option.\n\n    # Actually, the minimal number of draws is 2 because we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (which is allowed). \n\n    # But note: we might be able to form a sequence with two draws if we have two tiles in the same suit that are two apart? For example, [1m, 3m] and we draw 2m. But wait, we have three tiles. The hand might be [1m, 3m, something else]. Then to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m], we need to draw 2m. That's one draw. But we already checked for one-draw sequences.\n\n    # Since we are here, we did not find a one-draw solution. So the answer must be 2.\n\n    # However, let me confirm: \n    #   Example: ['1m', '2p', '3s'] — three distinct tiles, different suits, no duplicates, and no sequence possible. Then we need to draw two tiles. We can draw two '1m' to form a triplet, or draw any other combination. So the answer is 2.\n\n    # Therefore, we output 2.\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
