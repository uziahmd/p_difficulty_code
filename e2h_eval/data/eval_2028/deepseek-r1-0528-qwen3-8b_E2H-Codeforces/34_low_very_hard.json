And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let's recalc: the problem says \"average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\"\n\n But note: the example input has two weeks, so we are to compute:\n   total_sleep = (sum of week1) + (sum of week2) = (3+4) + (4+7) = 7 + 11 = 18\n   number of weeks = 2\n   average = 18 / 2 = 9.0\n\n However, wait: the example output is 9.0, which matches.\n\n But then the third example: \n   Input: 8 2\n          1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n   There are 7 weeks (since n=8, k=2 -> 8-2+1=7)\n   The sum of the first week (1+2)=3, then 2+4=6, then 4+100000=100004, then 100000+123=100123, then 123+456=579, then 456+789=1245, then 789+1=790.\n\n   Total sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = let me calculate step by step:\n\n     3+6 = 9\n     9+100004 = 100013\n     100013+100123 = 200136\n     200136+579 = 200715\n     200715+1245 = 201960\n     201960+790 = 202750\n\n   Then average = 202750 / 7 ≈ 28964.2857142857...\n\n So the problem is: we need the average of the sums of each contiguous k-day period.\n\n We can do:\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep = (sum of the first k days) + (sum of the next k days, which is the same as the previous one minus the first day plus the next day) and so on.\n\n We can precompute the prefix sum array to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n and k.\n   2. Read the list of n integers.\n   3. Compute the prefix sum array for the list.\n   4. For each week i (from 0 to n-k), the week starts at index i and goes to index i+k-1.\n        week_sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n   5. Sum up all week_sums, then divide by (n-k+1) to get the average.\n\n However, note: the total number of weeks is (n-k+1). But if we do this, the time complexity is O(n) which is acceptable because n <= 200000.\n\n But wait: the example input \"1 1\" -> n=1, k=1, then one week. \n   prefix[0] = 0, then for i=0: week_sum = prefix[1]-prefix[0] = a0.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Let P[0] = 0, P[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1}\n\n   Then the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is P[j+1] - P[i].\n\n   For week starting at i (0-indexed) and length k: indices i to i+k-1.\n        sum_i = P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n   Then total = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous subarray of length k days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average across all such weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing multiple overlapping windows (each of size k) in a sequence of n days. For each window, we need the sum of sleep times, and then the average of these sums across all windows.\n2. **Intuition**: Using a prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This optimization is crucial because without it, the naive approach would result in O(n*k) time complexity, which is inefficient for large n (up to 200,000).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the original array. This enables O(1) range sum queries.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each starting index of a window, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the next k elements.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The prefix sum array construction takes O(n) time. Each of the (n - k + 1) windows is processed in O(1) time using the prefix sum array, leading to an overall O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sleep = 0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        \n    avg = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers (n and k) followed by a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array is built such that each entry at index i contains the sum of the first i elements of the original array. This allows efficient range sum queries.\n3. **Total Weeks Calculation**: The number of weeks (contiguous subarrays of length k) is computed as `n - k + 1`. If there are no weeks (k > n), the result is trivially 0.\n4. **Summing Week Sleep Times**: For each week starting at index i, the sum of sleep times is obtained by subtracting the prefix sum at index i from the prefix sum at index i + k. This sum is accumulated into a total.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is the total sleep time divided by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging the prefix sum array for quick range sum calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
