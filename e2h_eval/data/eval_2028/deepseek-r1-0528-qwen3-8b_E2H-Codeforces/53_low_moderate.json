Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n However, note: we need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and these occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can consider all substrings and check for duplicates. But note: the problem asks for the longest one.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - We want the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check from the maximum possible length (which is n-1) down to 1 until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n How to check for a fixed length L?\n   - Extract all distinct substrings of length L (using a set or dictionary to record which ones we've seen).\n   - If we find at least two occurrences (or one occurrence that we can confirm by having at least two different starting indices? Actually, we just need to count the frequency), then we have found our answer.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two or more.\n\n However, we are asked for the longest. So we can iterate from the maximum possible length (n-1) down to 1, and the first length for which we find a duplicate is the answer.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'abcd' -> no duplicate substring of any positive length? Then output 0.\n   Input: 'ababa' -> \n        length 3: substrings: 'aba' (from index0 and index2) -> duplicate -> so answer is 3.\n\n But note: the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and output is ['0','3','2']\n\n For 'zzz': \n   length 2: substrings: 'zz' (from index0 and index1) -> duplicate -> so answer 2.\n\n However, note that the substring must appear at least twice. In 'zzz', the substring 'zz' appears twice (overlapping is allowed). \n\n Implementation:\n\n Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n\n We'll start from L = n-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create an empty dictionary (or set) to record the substrings we've seen.\n\n   For start index i from 0 to n-L:\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        if substring is in the dictionary: then we found a duplicate for length L -> return L.\n        else: add it to the dictionary.\n\n   If we don't find any duplicate for this L, we continue to L-1.\n\n If we don't find any duplicate for any L from n-1 down to 1, then output 0.\n\n However, note: the problem says the substring must appear at least twice. The above method checks for at least one duplicate occurrence (so at least two). \n\n But what about non-overlapping? The problem allows overlapping. So we are counting every occurrence.\n\n But note: the same substring appearing three times is still valid, we just need at least two.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the same substring appears but we count the same occurrence twice? We are using a set for each fixed L, so we are checking distinct substrings.\n\n Example: 'aaa'\n   n=3\n   Check L=2: substrings: \"aa\" (at index0) and \"aa\" (at index1). So we see two distinct occurrences? Actually, we are storing the substring and then when we see the same substring again, we know it's a duplicate.\n\n But note: we are storing the substring itself. The same substring in two different places is considered duplicate.\n\n However, the problem says: \"can be met in the string at least twice\". So two or more occurrences, regardless of position.\n\n This method will work.\n\n But wait: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the first duplicate, but that's okay because we are looking for the longest.\n\n However, we are iterating from the largest L down to 1. So we want the maximum L for which we have at least two occurrences.\n\n But note: we don't necessarily need to check all duplicates for a given L. We can break as soon as we find one.\n\n But there's an edge: if the entire string has duplicate substrings of the same length, then we break at the maximum L.\n\n However, what if the string is \"abcabc\"? \n   n=6\n   Check L=5: substrings: \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n   Check L=4: \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n   Check L=3: \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> duplicate \"abc\" (at index0 and index3). So answer 3.\n\n This matches.\n\n However, note that the problem says the substring can be met",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring of a certain length appears more than once. The solution must return the maximum length of such a substring. If no such substring exists, it returns 0.\n2. **Intuition**: The approach is to iterate over possible substring lengths from the largest possible down to 1. For each length, we check all substrings of that length to see if any duplicate exists. The first length (largest) for which a duplicate is found is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm uses a sliding window technique to generate all substrings of a given length and checks for duplicates using a dictionary (or set) to record seen substrings. This method efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the fact that longer substrings are checked first.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (from n-1 down to 1), we process up to n - length + 1 substrings. Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is computationally feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                duplicate_found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n        if duplicate_found:\n            print(L)\n            return\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string and checks if it's empty, printing 0 immediately if true.\n2. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Using a dictionary, the program tracks seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the loop breaks, and the current length is printed as the result.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicate is found for any length, the program prints 0 after checking all possible lengths.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the largest valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
