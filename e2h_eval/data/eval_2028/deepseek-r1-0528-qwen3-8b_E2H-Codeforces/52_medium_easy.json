Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   current_old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the old candles to make more new ones.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We start with 'a' new candles. This gives us 'a' hours and then we get 'a' old candles.\n   Then we can use these old candles to make more candles. Specifically, we can form floor(old_candles / b) new candles, and the remainder old candles are left.\n\n But note: the problem allows us to act optimally. We can combine all the old candles we get.\n\n Steps:\n   Let's denote:\n     total = a   (total candles we have that are usable, initially new)\n     hours = 0\n     leftover = 0\n\n However, we can simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Use all new candles (a). Then we get a hours and a old candles.\n   Then, while we have at least b old candles, we can convert some old candles into new ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b:\n        # Burn as many as we have (which is candles) -> each burns one hour\n        total_hours += candles\n        # After burning, we get 'candles' old candles\n        # Then we can make new_candles = candles // b\n        # And we leave the remainder (candles % b) for later\n        candles = candles // b + candles % b   # because we use (candles // b) * b old candles, so remainder is (candles % b)\n\n   However, wait: after burning the candles, we have exactly 'candles' old candles. Then we use as many as possible (floor division by b) to make new candles, and the remaining old candles are saved.\n\n   But note: in the next iteration, we are going to use the new candles we just made (so we add them to the total candles we can burn) and also we still have the leftover.\n\n   However, the above while loop condition is that we have at least b old candles? Actually, no: we are using the entire set of candles (both the old ones and the new ones we make) as the current stock. But note: the process is:\n\n        We start with 'a' (all new). Then we burn them, and get 'a' old. Then we use old candles to make new ones.\n\n   Actually, we should consider:\n\n        total_hours += a   (because we burn a candles, then we get a old candles)\n        Then, we can make a//b new candles, and we are left with a % b old candles.\n\n        Then we add the new candles (a//b) to our available candles (for the next burn) and also we have the leftover a % b.\n\n        So the next state: current_candles = (a//b) + (a % b)\n\n        Then we burn those, so we add that many hours, and then we get that many old candles, and again we can make (current_candles // b) new candles and leave (current_candles % b) as leftovers.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require to break the process until we have less than b? Actually, we break when the current_candles < b, but note that even if current_candles is less than b, we can still burn them (each one gives one hour) and then we don't get any new candles from them.\n\n   However, the above simulation does:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a\n\n        while current >= b:\n            total_hours += current   # burning all current candles\n            current = current // b   # making new candles from the old ones (but wait, we have current old candles? Actually, when we burn current candles, we get current old candles, but then we use some of them to make new ones and leave the rest.\n\n        But wait, the above while loop does not account for the leftover. The standard solution is:\n\n            total = a\n            hours = a\n            while total >= b:\n                new_candles = total // b\n                remainder = total % b\n                hours += new_candles\n                total = new_candles + remainder\n\n        Then output hours.\n\n   Let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n        a=4, b=2\n        total = 4, hours=4\n        while total>=2: \n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, remainder = 0\n            hours = 4+2 = 6\n            total = 2+0 = 2\n        Then while 2>=2: \n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1, remainder=0\n            hours = 6+1 = 7\n            total = 1+0 = 1 -> break\n\n        Output 7 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n\n        a=6, b=3\n        total=6, hours=6\n        while 6>=3:\n            new_candles=6//3=2, remainder=0\n            hours=6+2=8\n            total=2+0=2 -> break\n\n        Output 8 -> correct.\n\n   However, let me check with the sample \"1 2\": \n        a=1, b=2\n        total=1, hours=1\n        while 1<2 -> break. Output 1 -> correct.\n\n   But what about \"3 2\":\n        a=3, b=2\n        total=3, hours=3\n        while 3>=2:\n            new_candles=3//2=1, remainder=1\n            hours=3+1=4\n            total=1+1=2\n        Then while 2>=2:\n            new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0\n            hours=4+1=5\n            total=1+0=1 -> break.\n\n        So 5 hours.\n\n   Let's verify manually:\n        Start with 3 candles -> burn 3, get 3 old -> make 1 new candle (since 3//2=1, remainder 1 old)\n        Now we have 1 new candle and 1 old -> burn the 1 new candle, now we have 1+1=2 old -> make 1 new candle (2//2=1, remainder 0)\n        Then burn that 1 new candle -> done.\n\n        Hours: 3 (first burn) + 1 (second burn) + 1 (third burn) = 5. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        Read a and b\n        Initialize:\n            total = a\n            hours = 0\n\n        But wait, in the above we started with total=a and then we burned them. Alternatively, we can start by:\n\n        hours = 0\n        current = a\n        while current > 0:\n            # Burn all current candles (each one gives one hour)\n            hours += current\n            # Now, we get 'current' old candles. From these, we can make new_candles = current // b, and we leave remainder = current % b.\n            # Then, for the next iteration, we have the new_candles (which are new) and the remainder (which are old and will be used later).\n            current = current // b + current % b\n\n        But wait, in the first iteration: we start with current = a (which is the number of new candles). Then we burn them and get a old candles. Then we make floor(a/b) new candles and leave a % b old candles. Then current becomes floor(a/b) + a % b.\n\n        However, note that the initial state: we have a new candles. We haven't burned them yet. The above while loop would burn the a new candles and then update.\n\n        But the problem says: initially we have a new candles. Then we use them optimally.\n\n        However, the above while loop does burn the initial a candles, which is correct.\n\n        But let's run the example \"4 2\" with this:\n\n            current = 4\n            hours = 0\n            First iteration:\n                hours = 4\n                current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2 + 0 = 2\n            Second iteration:\n                hours = 4+2 = 6\n                current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n            Third iteration: 1>0 -> \n                hours = 6+1 = 7\n                current = 1//2 + 1%2 = 0 + 1 = 1\n            Fourth iteration: 1>0 -> \n                hours = 7+1 = 8\n                current = 1//2 + 1%2 = 0+1=1 -> infinite loop?\n\n        Why is that? Because we are burning the same candle twice? \n\n        Actually, the process: \n            We start with 4 new candles. We burn them (4 hours) and get 4 old. Then we make 4//2=2 new from the 4 old. Then we have 2 new candles (and 0 old because 4%2=0). Then we burn the 2 new candles (so 2 more hours, total 6) and get 2 old. Then we make 2//2=1 new and 0 leftover. Then we burn the 1 new candle (1 hour, total 7) and get 1 old. Then we cannot make a new candle (because 1<2) so we stop. \n\n        But the above while loop did 4, then 2, then 1, then 1 again. That's incorrect.\n\n        The issue is that in the last step, after burning the 1 new candle, we get 1 old, but we don't burn that 1 old candle because it's not a new candle? Actually, we only burn new candles. The old candles are collected and then converted to new ones.\n\n        In the above simulation, we are counting the burning of the new candles and then we are updating the current to include the leftover (which are old). But then in the next iteration, we are burning those old candles as if they were new? That's the mistake.\n\n        Correction: The process is:\n\n            We have a certain number of new candles (and separately we have old candles that we collect). But the conversion is: from old candles we make new candles. Then we can burn the new candles.\n\n        The correct simulation:\n\n            Let:\n                new = a   (initially we have 'a' new candles)\n                old = 0\n\n            Step 1: Burn all new candles (each gives one hour). Then:\n                hours += new\n                old += new   (because the new candles become old after burning)\n\n            Then, from the old candles, we can make:\n                new_from_old = old // b\n                leftover_old = old % b\n\n            Then we reset old to leftover_old, and add new_from_old to new (so now we have new = new_from_old).\n\n            Then we repeat the process until new == 0 (or until we don't have any new candles to burn).\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine the old and the new we are going to get from old in the same variable, but note: we can only burn the new ones.\n\n        However, the problem states that we can use the old candles to make new ones, and then we can burn the new ones.\n\n        But the above method is:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total_hours += new\n                old += new\n                new = old // b   # because we use old candles to make new ones, and the leftover goes to old?\n                old = old % b\n\n        But wait, that doesn't account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous steps. Actually, we are accumulating old candles from the burned ones (the new candles) and then we use them to make new candles.\n\n        However, in the above, we are using the entire old set to make new candles, and then we set old to the remainder.\n\n        Let's test with \"4 2\":\n\n            Initially: new=4, old=0, hours=0.\n\n            Iteration1:\n                hours += 4 -> 4\n                old += 4 -> 4\n                new = 4 // 2 = 2\n                old = 4 % 2 = 0\n\n            Iteration2:\n                hours += 2 -> 6\n                old += 2 -> 2\n                new = 2 // 2 = 1\n                old = 2 % 2 = 0\n\n            Iteration3:\n                hours += 1 -> 7\n                old += 1 -> 1\n                new = 1 // 2 = 0\n                old = 1 % 2 = 1\n\n            Then the loop ends because new==0.\n\n            Output 7 -> correct.\n\n        Now test \"6 3\":\n\n            new=6, old=0, hours=0.\n\n            Iteration1:\n                hours=6\n                old=6\n                new=6//3=2, old=6%3=0\n\n            Iteration2:\n                hours=8\n                old=2\n                new=2//3=0, old=2%3=2\n\n            Then loop ends.\n\n            Output 8 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we burned 2 new candles (which we got from the first conversion) and then we get 2 old candles. Then we try to make new candles from 2 old ones: 2//3=0, so we stop.\n\n        However, note that we can only burn the new candles. We have burned the initial 6 and then the 2 new ones, so total 8 hours.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait, in the example \"3 2\" with the above method:\n\n            new=3, old=0, hours=0.\n\n            Iteration1:\n                hours=3\n                old=3\n                new=3//2=1, old=3%2=1\n\n            Iteration2:\n                hours=4\n                old=1+1=2\n                new=2//2=1, old=2%2=0\n\n            Iteration3:\n                hours=5\n                old=1\n                new=1//2=0, old=1%2=1\n\n            Then stop. Output 5 -> correct.\n\n        However, there's a simpler way: we can combine the two steps (burning and converting) without having two variables for new and old.\n\n        Notice that after burning, we get a bunch of old candles (which is the same as the number of candles we just burned). Then we convert the old candles (which we have accumulated) to new ones.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            hours = 0\n            current = a   # current new candles\n\n            while current > 0:\n                hours += current   # burn all current new candles\n                # Now, we have 'current' old candles from burning.\n                # But we also have leftover old candles from previous cycles? Actually, we need to accumulate the old candles.\n\n        Alternatively, we can accumulate the old candles separately.\n\n        But note: the problem is that the old candles are being accumulated from the burned candles. We can also think of it as:\n\n            total_candles_used = a\n            hours = a\n            remaining_old = a\n            while remaining_old >= b:\n                new_made = remaining_old // b\n                remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_made   # because we use some to make new, and the new ones become old after burning\n                hours += new_made\n\n        However, wait: the above does not account for the fact that the new_made candles are burned in the next cycle. But note, we are adding the new_made to the hours, but actually we should burn them in the next cycle.\n\n        Let me try:\n\n            a=4, b=2\n\n            Step0: hours=0, remaining_old=0\n            Step1: \n                We start by burning the initial 4 -> hours=4, then we have 4 old.\n                Then, while remaining_old>=2: \n                    new_made = 4//2=2, remaining_old=0+2=2 -> then we add 2 to hours? (so hours=6) and then we continue the while because 2>=2.\n                    Then new_made=2//2=1, remaining_old=0+1=1 -> hours=7.\n\n            This gives 7.\n\n        But wait, the above accumulates the old candles and then uses them to make new ones and adds the new ones to the hours (without burning them in the same cycle). But note: the process is that we use the old candles to make new ones, and then we can burn those new ones. However, in the above we are adding the new ones to the hours immediately. This is acceptable because effectively we are burning the new ones in the next cycle, but we are counting the hours as we go.\n\n        However, note: the new ones we make are going to be burned in the next cycle, but we are adding their count to the hours. This is the same as if we burned them now? Actually, no: we are burning the initial a in the first cycle, then the new ones we made from the first cycle's old candles in the next cycle.\n\n        But the above code:\n\n            hours = a\n            remaining_old = a\n            while remaining_old >= b:\n                new_made = remaining_old // b\n                remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_made\n                hours += new_made\n\n        For a=4, b=2:\n\n            Start: hours=4, remaining_old=4\n            Iteration1: \n                new_made = 4//2=2, remaining_old=0+2=2, hours=6\n            Iteration2:\n                new_made=2//2=1, remaining_old=0+1=1, hours=7\n\n        This is the same as the two-variable method.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the initial a candles are burned and then we get a old candles. Then we use the old candles to make new ones (which we then burn in the following cycles). The above code counts the initial burn (a) and then the new_made (from the old candles) as hours, but the new_made candles are burned in the next cycle. But note: the problem counts each hour of burning. So the initial a candles give a hours, and then the new_made candles (from the first cycle) will give new_made hours (in the next cycle) and so on.\n\n        But the above code does not account for the fact that the new_made candles are burned in the next cycle. However, the process is sequential. We are effectively counting the hours from all the candles we have (including those made from old) without having to simulate the burning of the new_made candles separately.\n\n        However, the problem is that we are using the old candles to make new ones, and then we are burning the new ones. The above code is counting the initial a and then the new_made from the old, but the new_made candles are burned in the next cycle and they are added to the hours. This is correct.\n\n        But wait, what about the leftover old candles? In the above code, we are updating remaining_old to be the remainder plus the new_made (which are then available for the next cycle). However, note: the new_made candles are not old until they are burned. But we are not burning them until the next cycle. In the above code, we are treating the new_made as if they are available for immediate conversion? Actually, no: the new_made candles are made from the old, and then they are burned in the next cycle (so they are new in the next cycle). But in the above code, we are using the old candles (from the current cycle) to make new ones, and then we add the new ones to the remaining_old? That doesn't make sense because the new ones are not old until they are burned.\n\n        Let me clarify the state:\n\n            We have two types: \n                - Old candles: from the burned candles (which we are keeping)\n                - New candles: the ones we have that haven't been burned (which we can burn immediately)\n\n        The above code does not differentiate between the source of the candles. But note: the process is:\n\n            Step 1: Burn the new candles (if any) -> this gives hours and then we get old candles (from the burned ones). Then we use the old candles to make new ones.\n\n            However, in the above code we are starting with a (which is the initial new candles) and then we are using the old candles (which are a) to make new ones. Then we add the new ones to remaining_old. But the new ones are not old until they are burned.\n\n        But the key point is: we are allowed to use the old candles (from any previous burning) to make new ones. The above code is accumulating the old candles and then using them to make new ones, and then we add the new ones to the pool of old candles (but they are not old until burned). However, in the next cycle, we are going to burn the new ones (which are now available as new candles) and then they become old.\n\n        But wait, how do we separate the new ones from the old ones? Actually, we don't need to. The problem does not care about the type until they are burned. The rule is: you can make a new candle from any old candles (regardless of when they were produced). And when you burn a candle, it becomes old.\n\n        However, the above code is mixing the two: we are using the old candles to make new ones, and then we are including the new ones in the old set (remaining_old) for the next cycle. But the new ones are not old until they are burned. However, in the next cycle, we are going to burn them (so they become old) and then we use the old ones (which now include the burned new ones) to make more.\n\n        This is acceptable because the process is:\n\n            Cycle 1: \n                Burn the initial new candles (a) -> hours += a\n                Then we have a old candles.\n                Then we make floor(a/b) new candles from the old, and leave a % b old.\n                Then we have floor(a/b) new candles (which we can burn in the next cycle) and a % b old.\n\n            Cycle 2:\n                Burn the floor(a/b) new candles -> hours += floor(a/b)\n                Then we have floor(a/b) + a % b old candles (because the burned ones from cycle2 are old, and we had a % b old from cycle1)\n                Then we make floor((floor(a/b)+a % b)/b) new candles, and leave the remainder.\n\n        The above code does:\n\n            hours = a\n            remaining_old = a   [from cycle1]\n\n            Then, while remaining_old >= b:\n                new_made = remaining_old // b\n                remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_made   [this is the old from the current cycle (remaining_old % b) plus the new_made (which are from the old, and in the next cycle they become old)]\n\n            But note: the new_made candles are not burned in this cycle. They are burned in the next cycle. However, the above code is counting the new_made as hours? \n\n            Actually, no: the above code does not count the new_made candles as hours. It only counts the initial a. Then in the while loop, we are making new_made candles from the old, and then we add new_made to hours. \n\n            Wait, the code I wrote above was:\n\n                hours = a\n                remaining_old = a\n                while remaining_old >= b:\n                    new_made = remaining_old // b\n                    remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_made\n                    hours += new_made\n\n            This is different from the two-variable method. In the two-variable method, we burned the new candles and then updated the old. Here, we are not burning the new_made candles (we are just making them and then adding their count to hours). \n\n            Example \"4 2\":\n\n                hours = 4\n                remaining_old = 4\n                Iteration1: \n                    new_made = 4//2=2, remaining_old = 0+2=2, hours=6\n                Iteration2:\n                    new_made=2//2=1, remaining_old=0+1=1, hours=7\n\n            This counts the initial 4, then the 2, then the 1. But the 2 and 1 are the new candles we made, which are burned in the next cycles. However, in the problem, the burning happens one cycle at a time.\n\n            The correct process:\n\n                Cycle1: burn 4 -> 4 hours, then make 2 new from the 4 old -> then we have 2 new (which are not burned yet) and 0 old.\n                Cycle2: burn 2 -> 2 hours, then make 1 new from the 2 old -> then we have 1 new and 0 old.\n                Cycle3: burn 1 -> 1 hour, then make 0 from 1 old -> done.\n\n            Total hours = 4+2+1 = 7.\n\n            But in the above code, we are counting the initial 4, then the 2 (from the first conversion) and then the 1 (from the second conversion). This is the same as the total hours.\n\n            Why? Because the new_made candles are exactly the candles we are going to burn in the next cycle. And we are counting the hours from all the candles we ever have (including those made from old) by simply adding the number of candles we make (which we then burn). \n\n            But note: the initial a candles are burned and we count them. Then the new_made candles are burned and we count them. And the next new_made candles are burned and counted.\n\n            However, the above code does not simulate the burning of the new_made candles separately. It just accumulates the hours by the total number of candles that are eventually burned.\n\n            This is valid because every candle (whether originally new or made from old) burns for one hour.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            Read a and b\n            hours = 0\n            candles = a   # This is the initial new candles. But we haven't burned them yet.\n\n            However, the above code started with hours = a. But wait, we are going to burn the initial a candles, and then the new ones we make. But the above code counts the initial a and then the new_made (which are made from the old, i.e., from the initial a and then the next set). \n\n        Actually, the above code is:\n\n            hours = a   # This counts the initial burn\n            remaining_old = a   # the old candles from the initial burn\n\n            Then we use the old candles to make new ones, and we add the number of new ones to hours (because they will be burned later). Then we update the remaining_old.\n\n        But wait, the initial burn is counted, and then the new ones we make from the old are counted without burning them in the same cycle. However, the problem is that the new ones we make from the old are burned in the next cycle, so they are separate.\n\n        But note: the entire process is linear. The total hours is the sum of all the candles we burn. And the candles we burn are:\n\n            Cycle1: a (initial)\n            Cycle2: floor(a/b) (the new ones made from the old of cycle1)\n            Cycle3: floor( (floor(a/b) + (a % b)) / b )   [but wait, no: after cycle1, we have a old, then we make floor(a/b) new and leave a % b old. Then in cycle2, we burn the floor(a/b) new (so we get floor(a/b) old) and then we have a % b + floor(a/b) old, then we make floor((a % b + floor(a/b))/b) new.\n\n        The above code is effectively:\n\n            hours = a + floor(a/b) + floor((a % b + floor(a/b))/b) + ... \n\n        But note: the above code does not use the same formula. The above code does:\n\n            hours = a\n            remaining_old = a\n            while remaining_old >= b:\n                new_made = remaining_old // b\n                remaining_old = remaining_old % b + new_made\n                hours += new_made\n\n        This is a standard way to solve the problem.\n\n        However, let me test with \"1 2\": \n            a=1, b=2\n            hours = 1\n            remaining_old = 1 -> 1<2 -> break. Output 1 -> correct.\n\n        With \"3 2\": \n            a=3, b=2\n            hours=3\n            remaining_old=3\n            Iteration1: new_made=3//2=1, remaining_old=3%2+1=1+1=2, hours=4\n            Iteration2: new_made=2//2=1, remaining_old=0+1=1, hours=5 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the above code does not break down the process correctly? \n\n        Actually, the above code is:\n\n            hours = a   [we are burning the initial a candles, so that's correct]\n            remaining_old = a   [the old candles from the initial burn]\n\n            Then, while we have at least b old candles, we convert them to new ones. But note: the conversion is done from the entire remaining_old (which includes old from previous cycles and the current cycle) and then we update remaining_old to be the remainder and the new_made (which we then burn in the next cycle). \n\n        However, the new_made candles are burned in the next cycle, and we are counting them in the next iteration (by adding new_made to hours). But the condition for the next iteration is based on the remaining_old (which now includes the new_made?).\n\n        Actually, in the above code, the new_made candles are added to remaining_old (as part of the old set) for the next cycle? No, wait: \n\n            remaining_old = (remaining_old % b) + new_made\n\n        But the new_made candles are not old until they are burned. However, we are adding them to remaining_old. This is incorrect because they are not old until they are burned.\n\n        But note: in the next cycle, we are going to burn the new_made candles (if we have any) and then they become old. However, in the above code, we are using the new_made candles (which are new) as if they were old? \n\n        Let me reexamine the process:\n\n            Cycle1: \n                We burn the initial a (new) -> get a old.\n                Then we convert the old (a) to new_made = a//b and leave remainder = a % b.\n                Now, the new_made candles are new, so we should not consider them as old until they are burned.\n\n            Cycle2:\n                We burn the new_made candles (which are new) -> then they become old, and we get new_made old from burning, plus the remainder from cycle1 (a % b). Then we convert the total old (new_made + a % b) to new_made2.\n\n            However, the above code does:\n\n                remaining_old = (a % b) + new_made   [after cycle1]\n\n            But then in the next iteration, we use remaining_old (which includes new_made) to make new_made2. This is wrong because the new_made candles are not old until they are burned.\n\n        How to fix?\n\n        We need to separate the new candles and the old candles. But note: the problem does not require separating them, because the rule is: from any old candles (regardless of when they were produced) you can make new ones.\n\n        However, the process is:\n\n            We have two pools: \n                new_pool: the candles that are currently available and not burned (initially a)\n                old_pool: the candles that have been burned (initially 0)\n\n            Steps:\n\n            While new_pool > 0 or old_pool >= b:\n                If new_pool > 0:\n                    burn one new candle (but we can burn all at once because we act optimally)\n                    Actually, we burn all new candles at the beginning of the cycle? Or we can interleave? \n\n            But the problem says: Vasily can light up a new candle (each burns for an hour) and then he can use the went out candles (old) to make new ones.\n\n            The optimal strategy is to burn all available new candles (which are the ones we have that haven't been burned) and then use the old ones (from the burned ones and any leftovers) to make more new ones.\n\n            So we can model:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                new = a\n                old = 0\n\n                while new > 0 or old >= b:\n                    # Burn all new candles\n                    if new > 0:\n                        total_hours += new\n                        # The new candles become old\n                        old += new\n                        new = 0   # because we burned them all\n\n                    # Now, if old >= b, convert some old to new\n                    if old >= b:\n                        new_from_old = old // b\n                        old = old % b\n                        new += new_from_old\n\n            But note: we can do the conversion at any time, but optimally we do it after burning. However, we can also do multiple conversions? Actually, we can convert as long as we have enough old candles.\n\n            However, the above while loop condition is \"while new > 0 or old >= b\", meaning we break when there are no new candles and less than b old candles.\n\n            Let me test \"4 2\":\n\n                new=4, old=0 -> enter loop.\n                Burn new: total_hours=4, old=4, new=0.\n                Then, since old>=2: new_from_old=4//2=2, old=0, new=2.\n                Then, condition: new=2>0 -> enter loop.\n                Burn new: total_hours=6, old=2, new=0.\n                Then, old>=2: new_from_old=2//2=1, old=0, new=1.\n                Then, condition: new=1>0 -> enter loop.\n                Burn new: total_hours=7, old=1, new=0.\n                Then, old=1<2 -> break.\n\n            This gives 7.\n\n            Test \"6 3\":\n\n                new=6, old=0 -> burn: hours=6, old=6, new=0.\n                Convert: new_from_old=6//3=2, old=0, new=2.\n                Then, condition: new=2>0 -> burn: hours=8, old=2, new=0.\n                Then, convert: 2//3=0, so no change.\n                Break.\n\n            Output 8.\n\n            Test \"3 2\":\n\n                new=3, old=0 -> burn: hours=3, old=3, new=0.\n                Convert: 3//2=1, old=1, new=1.\n                Then, condition: new=1>0 -> burn: hours=4, old=2, new=0.\n                Convert: 2//2=1, old=0, new=1.\n                Then, condition: new=1>0 -> burn: hours=5, old=1, new=0.\n                Break.\n\n            Output 5.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note that the above while loop condition is \"while new > 0 or old >= b\". We break when there are no new candles and we don't have enough old candles to make a new one.\n\n        But wait, what if we have old candles but not enough to make a new one? We still have to burn the new ones if any. The above code does that.\n\n        But there's an edge: if we have no new candles and old candles, we don't burn anything (because new==0) and then we check if old>=b. If not, we break.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But is this efficient? The constraints are a, b from 1 to 1000. The number of iterations is logarithmic (base b) so it's safe.\n\n        However, we can also use the first method (with the while loop that uses the entire remaining_old including the new ones) but that method was incorrect because it mixed the types. The above method is clearer.\n\n        But the problem asks for a single integer. We can write:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while new > 0 or old >= b:\n                if new > 0:\n                    total_hours += new\n                    old += new\n                    new = 0\n\n                if old >= b:\n                    # Convert old candles to new\n                    new_from_old = old // b\n                    old = old % b\n                    new += new_from_old\n\n            print(total_hours)\n\n        Let me test with the examples.\n\n        However, note: the above code burns all new candles at once and then converts all old candles at once. This is optimal.\n\n        But wait, what if we have both new and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation is that each candle burns for one hour and can be regenerated from a certain number of used candles. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and converting used candles back into new ones until it's no longer possible to do so.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` new candles and zero old candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: While there are new candles available, burn all of them, adding their count to the total hours. Each burned candle contributes one hour and becomes an old candle.\n3. **Converting Old Candles**: After burning, if there are enough old candles (at least `b`), convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of the old candles by `b`, and the remainder old candles remain.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles or enough old candles to convert into new ones. The process stops when neither condition is met, and the total hours accumulated is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and regenerating process, ensuring optimal use of candles to maximize the total burning time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    new = a\n    old = 0\n    \n    while new > 0 or old >= b:\n        if new > 0:\n            total_hours += new\n            old += new\n            new = 0\n            \n        if old >= b:\n            new_from_old = old // b\n            old = old % b\n            new += new_from_old\n            \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `total_hours`, `new`, and `old` are initialized to zero. The initial number of new candles is set to `a`.\n2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles or enough old candles to convert into new ones.\n3. **Burning New Candles**: Inside the loop, if there are new candles, they are burned (each contributing one hour), and the total hours are updated. The burned candles are then added to the old candles count.\n4. **Converting Old Candles**: If the old candles count reaches or exceeds `b`, they are converted into new candles. The number of new candles is calculated using integer division, and the remainder old candles are kept for future conversions.\n5. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the total hours accumulated is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
