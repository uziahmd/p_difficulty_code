Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Conditions:\n   Two vouchers i and j (i != j) such that:\n     1. They don't intersect: either ri < lj or rj < li.\n     2. The sum of durations is exactly x: (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x.\n\n We are to find the minimal total cost.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note: duration_i = d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1). Then we need two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n 2. We can group vouchers by their duration. However, note that the condition for disjointness is more complex.\n\n 3. Let's denote:\n        For voucher i: (l_i, r_i, cost_i, duration_i)\n\n 4. We cannot iterate over all pairs (n up to 200000) so we must use a smarter way.\n\n 5. Idea:\n    We are going to consider pairs (d, x-d) for durations. But note: the same duration might appear multiple times.\n\n 6. We can precompute an array `vouchers_by_duration` where for each duration d (from 1 to max_duration, which is up to 200000) we store the list of (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n 7. But then we have to check non-intersection. However, even if two vouchers have durations d and x-d, they still must not overlap.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can think: we need two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] such that (r1-l1+1)+(r2-l2+1)=x, and either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n 9. How to efficiently check for two intervals of fixed durations? \n\n    Let d1 = some value, d2 = x - d1.\n\n    For a fixed pair (d1, d2):\n        Consider all vouchers with duration d1 and all with duration d2.\n\n        Condition 1: They don't intersect. This means we require that the first voucher ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts.\n\n        But note: the two vouchers are independent. We have two cases:\n\n            Case A: [voucher1] and [voucher2] (with duration d1 and d2 respectively) must satisfy: \n                    r1 < l2   OR   r2 < l1\n\n        However, we can break this into two separate cases:\n\n            Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts: r1 < l2.\n            Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n        But note: we don't know which one is first. So we can do:\n\n            We consider two orders:\n\n                Order 1: The first voucher (duration d1) must end by a certain day, and the second (duration d2) must start after that.\n\n                Order 2: The second voucher (duration d2) must end by a certain day, and the first (duration d1) must start after that.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify which voucher is taken first. However, the condition is symmetric.\n\n        Actually, we can consider without loss of generality that the first voucher (with duration d1) must end before the second starts (if we take the first voucher first) OR the second voucher (with duration d2) must end before the first starts.\n\n        However, we can also consider: we want to combine any two vouchers from two different groups (unless d1==d2, then we have two vouchers from the same group) but note: if d1+d2=x and d1==d2 then 2*d1=x, so x must be even. In that case, we cannot use two distinct vouchers from the same group if they are the same duration? Actually, wait: the problem says two distinct vouchers (i != j). But if the same duration appears multiple times, then we can use two from the same group as long as they don't intersect.\n\n        So, we have two scenarios:\n\n            Scenario 1: d1 != d2. Then we have two distinct groups (for duration d1 and d2). We want to find two vouchers (one from d1 and one from d2) that are disjoint.\n\n            Scenario 2: d1 == d2 and d1+d2=x, then d1 = d2 = x/2. Then we have to pick two distinct vouchers from the same group (with duration x/2) that are disjoint.\n\n 10. How to handle Scenario 1?\n\n        We need to find a voucher in group d1 and a voucher in group d2 such that either:\n            (a) r1 < l2   OR   (b) r2 < l1\n\n        We can break it down:\n\n            (a) r1 < l2: then we want the smallest cost in group d1 that has r1 <= some bound (and then we can look for the smallest cost in group d2 that has l2 >= r1+1). But note: we are free to choose any two.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            For each voucher in group d1, we want to consider:\n\n                In group d2: we want a voucher that starts at least at r1+1 (so that they don't overlap). And we want the minimum cost in group d2 for vouchers with l2 >= r1+1.\n\n            Similarly, we can consider the other order: for each voucher in group d2, we want a voucher in group d1 that starts at least at r2+1.\n\n        However, note that the condition is symmetric. But we are already considering both orders by the two conditions. Actually, the two conditions are:\n\n            Condition (a): r1 < l2   -> the first voucher ends before the second starts.\n\n            Condition (b): r2 < l1   -> the second voucher ends before the first starts.\n\n        But note: the two conditions are independent. We can process:\n\n            For condition (a): we fix the first voucher (from d1) and then look in d2 for a voucher that starts after r1.\n\n            For condition (b): we fix the second voucher (from d2) and then look in d1 for a voucher that starts after r2.\n\n        But wait: the two conditions are actually the same set of pairs? No, because the condition (a) requires the first voucher (d1) to end before the second (d2) starts, and condition (b) requires the second (d2) to end before the first (d1) starts.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not assign order. So we can also consider that the two vouchers can be taken in any order. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            We require that the entire interval of d1 is before the entire interval of d2 OR the entire interval of d2 is before the entire interval of d1.\n\n        But note: the condition is \"at least one of the following\": \n            Condition 1: ri < lj   [here i is d1 and j is d2] -> meaning the first voucher (d1) ends before the second (d2) starts.\n            Condition 2: rj < li   [here i is d1 and j is d2] -> meaning the second voucher (d2) ends before the first (d1) starts.\n\n        So we have two possibilities.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Possibility 1: Use a voucher from d1 and a voucher from d2 such that the d1 voucher ends before the d2 voucher starts.\n\n            Possibility 2: Use a voucher from d2 and a voucher from d1 such that the d2 voucher ends before the d1 voucher starts.\n\n        However, note: the groups are defined by duration. The two possibilities are actually the same set of pairs, but the condition is asymmetric. We must consider both.\n\n        But note: the two possibilities are mutually exclusive. So we can combine them by:\n\n            Consider all pairs (i, j) from the two groups (d1, d2) and check the condition. But that is too expensive.\n\n        Instead, we can preprocess the groups.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n            For group d1 (duration d1), we want to quickly query: given a value 'a' (which is the end of a voucher from d2, say), we want the minimal cost for a voucher in d1 that ends before 'a'? Actually, no.\n\n        Let me reframe:\n\n            Possibility 1: We want a voucher in d1 (with [l1, r1]) and a voucher in d2 (with [l2, r2]) such that r1 < l2.\n\n                Then we can sort the group d1 by r (the end) and then for each voucher in d2, we can look for the minimal cost in d1 for all vouchers with r < l2.\n\n            Possibility 2: We want a voucher in d1 and a voucher in d2 such that r2 < l1.\n\n                Then we can sort the group d1 by l (the start) and then for each voucher in d2, we can look for the minimal cost in d1 for all vouchers with l > r2.\n\n        However, note: the condition in possibility 2 is: the entire d2 voucher must end before the d1 voucher starts. So we can also index d1 by l.\n\n        But wait: we are combining two groups. We need to do two separate queries.\n\n        Alternatively, we can preprocess each group with two structures:\n\n            Group d1: \n                Structure A (for possibility 1): keyed by r (end) and store the minimal cost for any voucher in d1 with a given r (or up to a given r).\n                Structure B (for possibility 2): keyed by l (start) and store the minimal cost for any voucher in d1 with a given l (or above a given l).\n\n        Similarly for group d2, but note: in possibility 1 we use d1 and d2, so for d2 we can just use the entire group and then for each voucher in d2, we query d1 by its r (for structure A) and for possibility 2, we use d2 and d1, so we can use structure B of d1 and then for each voucher in d2, we query d1 by l.\n\n        But note: the two possibilities are independent.\n\n        Steps for a fixed (d1, d2):\n\n            Possibility 1 (d1 ends before d2 starts):\n\n                Sort the group d1 by r (end). Then create an array min_cost_by_r where for each r, we store the minimal cost for any voucher in d1 that has end <= current r.\n\n                Then, for each voucher in d2 (with [l2, r2]), we require a voucher in d1 with r1 < l2. So we can binary search in the sorted list of d1 by r (we have the list of r's) to find the maximum r1 that is < l2, and then get the minimal cost for all vouchers in d1 with r <= that maximum.\n\n                Then, candidate1 = (min_cost_d1 + cost_d2) for each d2.\n\n            Possibility 2 (d2 ends before d1 starts):\n\n                Sort the group d1 by l (start). Then create an array min_cost_by_l where for each l, we store the minimal cost for any voucher in d1 that has start >= current l.\n\n                Then, for each voucher in d2 (with [l2, r2]), we require a voucher in d1 with l1 > r2. So we can binary search in the sorted list of d1 by l (we have the list of l's) to find the minimum l1 that is > r2, and then get the minimal cost for all vouchers in d1 with l >= that minimum.\n\n                Then, candidate2 = (min_cost_d1 + cost_d2) for each d2.\n\n            Then, we combine the two possibilities for the fixed (d1,d2) and update the answer.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating over all d1 and d2 such that d1+d2=x. The number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but note that x is fixed and the durations are positive integers. The pairs (d1, d2) are only the ones that satisfy d1+d2=x. So d1 can range from 1 to x-1, and d2=x-d1. But note: we only consider durations that are in the range [1, 200000]. So we can iterate d1 from 1 to x-1 (but skip if d1>d_max or d2>d_max, where d_max=200000).\n\n        But note: the input constraints: li, ri in [1, 200000] -> so duration d_i = ri-li+1 is in [1, 200000]. So d1 and d2 must be in [1,200000]. Therefore, we only consider d1 in [max(1, x-200000), min(x-1,200000)].\n\n        However, the problem says that the vacation is x days, and the total duration is x. Since each voucher's duration is at most 200000, then d1 must be at least 1 and d2=x-d1 must be at most 200000, so d1>=x-200000 (if x>200000, then d1>=x-200000, else d1>=1). Similarly, d2=x-d1 must be at least 1 -> d1<=x-1.\n\n        Since x up to 200000, then we iterate over about 200000 distinct pairs? That is too many.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        We cannot iterate over all d1 from 1 to x-1 because x can be up to 200000 and we have 200000 distinct durations, but note: many durations may not appear. We can:\n\n            Precompute an array `groups` for durations from 1 to 200000 (index by duration) containing the list of vouchers (each voucher is (l, r, cost)) for that duration.\n\n        Then, for each duration d that appears (and d <= 200000) and let d2 = x-d, and if d2 is in the range [1,200000] and d2 exists, then we process the pair (d, d2). But note: if d==d2, then we are processing the same group twice? Actually, we would process (d, d2) and then (d2, d) is the same. So we should avoid double counting.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require ordering. We can process each unordered pair (d1, d2) once. However, if d1 != d2, then we process the pair (d1, d2) and then (d2, d1) is the same. But wait: our two possibilities are symmetric. Actually, we are processing the same two groups. However, we are storing the groups by duration. So we can do:\n\n            For d1 in [1, 200000]:\n                d2 = x - d1\n                if d2 < 1 or d2 > 200000: skip.\n                if d1 < d2: \n                    Process the pair (d1, d2)\n                elif d1 == d2:\n                    Process the pair (d1, d2) [then we are using the same group for both]\n\n        But wait: the two possibilities are:\n\n            Possibility 1: d1 voucher ends before d2 voucher starts.\n            Possibility 2: d2 voucher ends before d1 voucher starts.\n\n        However, note: when d1==d2, we are processing the same group for both possibilities. But that's okay because the two possibilities are distinct: one requires the first voucher (which is of duration d1) to end before the second (same duration) starts, and the other requires the second (same duration) to end before the first starts. However, note: the two conditions are symmetric and we are considering the same set of vouchers.\n\n        But note: if we consider the same group for both, then we are effectively considering all pairs of two distinct vouchers from the same group (with duration d1) that satisfy either condition.\n\n        However, in our processing above for (d1, d2) we considered:\n\n            Possibility 1: from group d1 and group d2 (if d1 != d2, then d1 and d2 are distinct groups). If d1==d2, then we are using the same group for both groups. But note: the two possibilities are:\n\n                Possibility 1: (voucher from d1) ends before (voucher from d2) starts -> but since d1==d2, we are taking two distinct vouchers from the same group.\n\n                Possibility 2: (voucher from d2) ends before (voucher from d1) starts.\n\n            However, these two possibilities are the same set of pairs? Actually, no. They are two different ways to arrange the two vouchers. But note: the condition is symmetric: if we have two vouchers A and B, then either A ends before B starts OR B ends before A starts. But they cannot both happen (unless they are the same, but distinct). So we must consider both.\n\n        But wait: if we use the same group for both, then we are effectively processing the same set of pairs twice? \n\n        Actually, we are processing the same two groups (when d1==d2) only once. Because we are iterating d1 from 1 to 200000, and when d1==d2, we only process the pair (d1, d2) once (because we skip if d1>d2? Actually, no: we are iterating d1 and then checking if d1<d2 or not. But when d1==d2, we don't skip, we process. However, if we process (d1, d2) for d1==d2, then we are using the same group for both. But then we are processing the same pair (the same two groups) again when we later get to d1' = d2 = d1? \n\n        We must avoid processing the same pair twice. So we can:\n\n            For d1 from 1 to 200000:\n                d2 = x - d1\n                if d2 < 1 or d2 > 200000: continue\n                if d1 < d2:\n                    process (d1, d2)   # distinct groups\n                elif d1 == d2:\n                    process (d1, d2)   # same group, but we will handle the same group separately\n\n        However, note: if we process the same group, then we are effectively processing the same set of pairs as the distinct groups but with two possibilities.\n\n        But wait: in the distinct groups case (d1 != d2) we process two possibilities. In the same group case (d1==d2) we also process two possibilities? Actually, no: in the same group case, we have only one set of vouchers (the same group) and the two possibilities are two different conditions. However, we cannot use the same method because our data structure for d1 and d2 (which are the same) would be the same. \n\n        Alternatively, we can split the processing:\n\n            For distinct groups (d1, d2) with d1 < d2:\n                Possibility 1: from group d1 (voucher1) and group d2 (voucher2) such that r1 < l2.\n                Possibility 2: from group d1 (voucher1) and group d2 (voucher2) such that r2 < l1.\n\n            For same group (d1 == d2) and d1+d2=x (so 2*d1=x, and x must be even):\n                We need two distinct vouchers from the same group (duration d1) such that either:\n                    Condition 1: r1 < l2   (voucher1 ends before voucher2 starts)\n                    Condition 2: r2 < l1   (voucher2 ends before voucher1 starts)\n\n                But note: Condition 1 and Condition 2 are the same set of pairs? Actually, no: Condition 1 requires that the first voucher ends before the second starts, and Condition 2 requires the opposite. And these are two separate conditions. But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive for distinct vouchers? Not necessarily: two intervals can be disjoint in two different ways, but actually if two intervals are disjoint then one must be entirely to the left of the other. So the two conditions are the two possible ways they are disjoint.\n\n                However, we cannot use the same two-possibility method as above because we are using two different groups. Now we have only one group. So we can do:\n\n                    We want to find two distinct vouchers (i and j) from the same group (duration d1) such that either:\n                        (a) r_i < l_j   OR   (b) r_j < l_i\n\n                    And we want the minimal total cost.\n\n                How to do that? We can:\n\n                    Sort the entire group (all vouchers of duration d1) by their end (r) and then by their start (l)? \n\n                    Then, for each voucher i (with [l_i, r_i]), we want to find a voucher j (distinct) such that either:\n                        (a) r_i < l_j, OR\n                        (b) r_j < l_i.\n\n                    Then, we can:\n\n                        For condition (a): we want the minimal cost voucher j (with j != i) that has l_j > r_i.\n\n                        For condition (b): we want the minimal cost voucher j (with j != i) that has r_j < l_i.\n\n                    But note: we are allowed to use any two distinct vouchers. We can precompute:\n\n                        Let A = sorted list of all vouchers in the group by l (start) and by r (end) separately.\n\n                    However, we can also use two Fenwick trees or segment trees, but note the constraints: up to 200000 vouchers per group? Actually, the total n is 200000, so the group might have up to 200000 vouchers.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                        Precompute two arrays for the same group:\n\n                            Array1: for condition (a): sort by r (end) and then build a structure that for a given r, we can get the minimal cost for any voucher with l > some value? Actually, we want to find a voucher j with l_j > r_i (for condition a). Similarly, for condition (b): we want a voucher j with r_j < l_i.\n\n                    But note: we are iterating over each voucher i and then querying the entire group. We can precompute:\n\n                        For condition (a): \n                            We want the minimal cost for any voucher j (in the same group) with l_j > r_i.\n\n                            We can sort the group by l (start) and then for each voucher i, we can do a binary search for the first voucher j with l_j > r_i, and then take the minimal cost from the suffix of that subarray.\n\n                        Similarly, for condition (b):\n                            We want the minimal cost for any voucher j (in the same group) with r_j < l_i.\n\n                            We can sort the group by r (end) and then for each voucher i, we can do a binary search for the last voucher j with r_j < l_i, and then take the minimal cost from the prefix of that subarray.\n\n                    However, we must remember that the two vouchers must be distinct. So we cannot use the same voucher. But if we store the minimal cost for the entire group (without excluding the current) then we might include the same voucher. So we need to be careful.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Step 1: Precompute two arrays for the same group:\n\n                            By start (l): \n                                sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])   # x is (l, r, cost)\n                                Then, we can create an array min_cost_from_start: from the right (by l) we can compute the minimum cost for any voucher from index i to the end (by start). But note: we want by l, so we are sorting by l. Then for a given l_i, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= some value? Actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l > r_i (for condition a). So:\n\n                                    Let arr_start = sorted_by_start, and then we can create an array min_cost_suffix[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                            Similarly, for condition (b): \n                                sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                                Then, min_cost_prefix[i] = minimum cost from the beginning to index i.\n\n                        But note: condition (a): we require l_j > r_i. So we can:\n\n                            Find the first index j0 in sorted_by_start such that l_j >= (r_i+1) [since l_j must be > r_i, and l_j are integers]. Then the minimal cost in the suffix starting at j0.\n\n                        However, we must ensure that the voucher j is distinct from i. But if the minimal cost in the suffix includes i, then we must check. Alternatively, we can precompute the minimal cost for the entire group and then if the minimal cost is from the same voucher, we have to look for the next one.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute the entire group's minimal cost and then remove the current voucher's cost and then query? But that would be too slow.\n\n                    Instead, we can precompute two arrays for the entire group:\n\n                        min_cost_overall = min(cost for voucher in group)\n\n                    But then if the overall minimum is from the current voucher, then we need the next minimum.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Precompute two arrays for the entire group (by start and by end) without including the current voucher? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n                        Let S = sorted list of (l, r, cost) for the group.\n\n                        For condition (a): \n                            We want to find the minimal cost among all vouchers (in the group) with l > r_i, excluding the current voucher if necessary.\n\n                        We can precompute:\n\n                            min_cost_by_start = an array for the entire group (by l) that stores the minimal cost for each l, and then we can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for range minimum queries.\n\n                    Given the constraints (n up to 200000) and the fact that we have to do this for each group that appears, we need an efficient method.\n\n        This is getting complicated.\n\n        Let me reconsider the overall approach.\n\n        We are required to minimize the total cost. We are only concerned with pairs (i, j) that have durations d1 and d2 (where d1+d2=x) and are disjoint.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n        Instead of grouping by duration, we can try to use the fact that the total duration is fixed (x). We can iterate over the vouchers and for each voucher i (with duration d_i) we want to find a voucher j (with duration x-d_i) that is disjoint from i.\n\n        But then we have to check for each voucher i and for each voucher j of duration x-d_i (which might be many) and check disjointness. That is O(n^2).\n\n        We need to do better.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n            We want to consider two sets of vouchers: one set is for durations d, the other set is for durations x-d.\n\n            We can precompute for each duration d (that appears) the list of vouchers (l, r, cost) and then for each duration d, we want to store:\n\n                For the group d: \n                    sorted by l (start) and by r (end)\n\n                Additionally, we want to store the minimal cost for a given constraint.\n\n            Then, for each duration d, we can:\n\n                Let d2 = x - d.\n\n                Then, we consider two possibilities: \n\n                    Possibility 1: use a voucher from group d (call it A) and a voucher from group d2 (call it B) such that A ends before B starts.\n\n                    Possibility 2: use a voucher from group d (call it A) and a voucher from group d2 (call it B) such that B ends before A starts.\n\n                But note: the condition for possibility 1 is: r_A < l_B.\n\n                How to quickly find the minimal total cost for possibility 1?\n\n                    We can iterate over the group d2 (which is the other group) and for each voucher B (l_B, r_B) in group d2, we want the minimal cost in group d for any voucher A with r_A < l_B.\n\n                Similarly, for possibility 2: for each voucher B in group d2, we want the minimal cost in group d for any voucher A with l_A > r_B.\n\n            But note: we cannot iterate over each voucher in group d2 and then do a linear scan over group d. We need to preprocess group d for possibility 1 and group d for possibility 2.\n\n            Steps for possibility 1 (for a fixed pair (d, d2)):\n\n                Preprocess group d:\n\n                    Sort the vouchers in group d by r (the end). Then, create an array `min_cost_by_r` for group d: for each end value, we want the minimal cost for any voucher in group d that has end <= that value.\n\n                    Then, for each voucher B in group d2 (with start s = l_B), we want to find the maximal end value r0 such that r0 < s, and then the minimal cost in group d for vouchers with end <= r0.\n\n                Similarly, for possibility 2:\n\n                    Preprocess group d by sorting by l (the start). Then, for each voucher B in group d2 (with end e = r_B), we want the minimal cost in group d for vouchers with start > e.\n\n            Then, the total cost for possibility 1 is: min_cost_found (from group d) + cost_B (for voucher B).\n\n            And similarly for possibility 2.\n\n            Then, we take the minimum over all B in group d2 and over the two possibilities.\n\n            Then, we combine with the same for the other order (if d != d2, then we also consider the pair (d2, d) for the two possibilities? Actually, no: because the two possibilities are symmetric. But note: we are fixing the pair (d, d2). In possibility 1, we are using a voucher from d and then a voucher from d2. In possibility 2, we are using a voucher from d and then a voucher from d2 (but the condition is reversed). \n\n            However, wait: the condition for possibility 2 is: the voucher from d2 must end before the voucher from d starts. But in our processing above, we are using group d for the voucher A and group d2 for voucher B. But in possibility 2, we are requiring that the voucher B (from d2) ends before the voucher A (from d) starts. So we are not swapping the groups arbitrarily.\n\n            But note: the two possibilities are:\n\n                Possibility 1: A (from d) ends before B (from d2) starts.\n                Possibility 2: B (from d2) ends before A (from d) starts.\n\n            These are two distinct conditions.\n\n            Now, what if we swap the groups? Then we would get the same conditions but with d and d2 swapped. But note: the pair (d, d2) is the same as (d2, d) only if d==d2. Otherwise, they are distinct.\n\n            However, we are iterating over d from 1 to 200000 and consider d2=x-d. We are processing each unordered pair (d, d2) once (if d<=d2) and once if d>d2? Actually, we are processing each ordered pair (d, d2) for every d. But note: the conditions are not symmetric in d and d2. \n\n            Example: \n                Possibility 1 for (d, d2): requires A (from d) ends before B (from d2) starts.\n                Possibility 1 for (d2, d): requires A (from d2) ends before B (from d) starts.\n\n            These are different conditions. But note: if d != d2, then we are processing (d, d2) and (d2, d) separately. However, we are only processing (d, d2) when d<=d2 (to avoid double counting) and then we are missing the condition for the other order? \n\n            Let me clarify:\n\n                Condition 1: A from d ends before B from d2 starts. -> processed in (d, d2) for possibility 1.\n\n                Condition 2: B from d2 ends before A from d starts. -> processed in (d, d2) for possibility 2.\n\n            But wait: in our processing above for the same pair (d, d2) we are processing both conditions. So we don't need to process (d2, d) separately.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                For d in [1, 200000]:\n                    d2 = x - d\n                    if d2 < 1 or d2 > 200000: skip.\n                    if d < d2:\n                        process the pair (d, d2) for both possibilities.\n                    elif d == d2:\n                        process the same group for both possibilities (as described for same group).\n\n            However, note: when d > d2, we skip. But then we miss the pair (d2, d) because d2 < d. But we are iterating d from 1 to 200000, and when d2=x-d is in [1,200000] and d2<d, then we would have encountered d2 earlier? \n\n            Actually, if d2 < d, then we would have processed the pair (d2, d) when d'=d2 and d2'=d (and then d' < d2') is true, so we would have processed (d2, d). But note: the conditions are symmetric. \n\n            However, wait: the conditions in the two possibilities are not symmetric in d and d2. But note: the conditions are defined by the durations. The condition for possibility 1 is: a voucher from d must end before a voucher from d2 starts. This is the same as: a voucher from d2 must start after a voucher from d ends. \n\n            But if we swap d and d2, then the condition becomes: a voucher from d2 must end before a voucher from d starts. Which is possibility 2 of the original pair (d, d2). \n\n            Actually, we are processing both conditions for the pair (d, d2) in one go. So we don't need to process (d2, d) separately.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply iterate d from 1 to 200000, and for each d, if d2=x-d is in [1,200000] and d<=d2, then process the pair (d, d2). But then we are only processing half of the pairs? \n\n            Let me think with an example:\n\n                Suppose x=5, then we consider d=1, d2=4; d=2, d2=3; d=3, d2=2; d=4, d2=1.\n\n                We only process d=1 (d2=4) and d=2 (d2=3) because d<=d2.\n\n                But the pair (3,2) is the same as (2,3) in terms of the set of durations, but the conditions are:\n\n                    For (2,3): \n                        Possibility 1: a voucher from duration 2 ends before a voucher from duration 3 starts.\n                        Possibility 2: a voucher from duration 3 ends before a voucher from duration 2 starts.\n\n                For (3,2): \n                    Possibility 1: a voucher from duration 3 ends before a voucher from duration 2 starts. -> this is the same as possibility 2 of (2,3)\n                    Possibility 2: a voucher from duration 2 ends before a voucher from duration 3 starts. -> this is the same as possibility 1 of (2,3)\n\n                So if we process (2,3) and (3,2) we are essentially processing the same two conditions. But we are only processing (2,3) (because 2<3) and skipping (3,2) (because 3>2). \n\n                However, the conditions are the same. So we don't need to process (3,2). \n\n                But wait: the conditions are defined by the durations, and the durations are fixed. The two possibilities are independent of the order of d and d2. \n\n                Therefore, we can simply iterate d from 1 to floor(x/2) (inclusive) and consider d2=x-d (which is >=d). \n\n                However, if x is even, then d=x/2 is included (and then d==d2). \n\n                But note: d from 1 to floor(x/2) might not cover d2 if d2 is greater than floor(x/2). \n\n                Actually, if d runs from 1 to floor(x/2), then d2 = x-d runs from x-1 down to ceil(x/2). And if d<=floor(x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently processing the vouchers by grouping them based on their durations and then checking for valid pairs that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we categorize all vouchers into groups based on their duration (i.e., the number of days they cover). This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d` in the groups. If such a duration exists, we then look for pairs of vouchers (one from `d` and one from `d2`) that do not overlap.\n3. **Non-Overlapping Condition**: To ensure vouchers do not overlap, we use two conditions:\n   - The end of the first voucher must be before the start of the second voucher.\n   - The end of the second voucher must be before the start of the first voucher.\n4. **Efficient Query Handling**: For each group, we preprocess the vouchers to allow efficient range queries. Specifically, we sort the vouchers by their start and end times and use prefix and suffix arrays to store the minimum costs for quick access during the search for valid pairs.\n5. **Combining Results**: For each valid pair found, we compute the total cost and keep track of the minimum cost encountered during the entire search process.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom

each voucher.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of tuples containing the start day, end day, and cost of each voucher.\n3. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, the code checks if there exists a complementary duration `d2 = x - d`. If found, it processes the pairs of vouchers from these two durations.\n4. **Non-Overlapping Check**: For each voucher in one duration group, the code checks if there's a voucher in the complementary group that does not overlap with it. This is done using binary search on pre-sorted lists of start and end times.\n5. **Cost Calculation**: The minimum cost for valid pairs is tracked and updated during the search. If no valid pairs are found, the output is `-1`; otherwise, the minimum cost is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
