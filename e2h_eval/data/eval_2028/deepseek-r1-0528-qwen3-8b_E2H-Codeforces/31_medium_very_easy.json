Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards (each with an integer between -x and x) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then, we need to add a set of cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of the added cards is -S.\n\n We wish to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n We can use as many cards as we want, but each card's absolute value is at most x.\n\n The key is: what is the minimum number of cards needed to represent the value -S?\n\n Note: We are allowed to choose any integers from -x to x.\n\n Actually, we can break it down:\n\n Let T = -S (the target sum for the additional cards)\n\n We want to represent T as the sum of k integers, each in the range [-x, x]. What is the minimum k?\n\n Since we can choose positive and negative numbers, note:\n\n - If T = 0, then we need 0 additional cards.\n\n But note: we might already have a sum S that is non-zero, so T = -S.\n\n However, we are allowed to use multiple cards. The problem reduces to: \n\n What is the minimum number of cards (each with absolute value at most x) required to form the integer T?\n\n This is equivalent to: \n   We want the smallest k such that there exist integers a1, a2, ..., ak with |ai|<=x and sum_i ai = T.\n\n Conditions for k:\n\n 1. The maximum positive contribution from k cards is k*x (if all are +x)\n 2. The maximum negative contribution from k cards is -k*x (if all are -x)\n\n Therefore, the total sum we can achieve must lie in [-k*x, k*x].\n\n Moreover, we can achieve every integer value between -k*x and k*x? \n\n Actually, we can achieve every integer in the interval [ -k*x, k*x ] if we are allowed to use any integers in [-x,x]?\n Let's think:\n\n With one card: we can get any integer from -x to x.\n\n With two cards: \n   Minimum: -2x, maximum: 2x, and we can get every integer in between? \n   For example, to get 0: two cards [0,0] or [1,-1] etc. But note: we are not restricted to distinct numbers.\n\n However, note that we can use zeros as well. But zeros don't change the sum.\n\n Actually, we can get every integer between -2x and 2x because:\n   We can adjust the two cards by 1. For example, to get T (with |T|<=2x), we can do:\n\n   Let a and b be two integers in [-x, x] such that a+b = T.\n\n   We can set a = min(x, max(-x, T)) and then set b = T - a, but we must ensure |b|<=x.\n\n   However, note that if T is even, we can split it arbitrarily. But wait, what if T is odd? \n\n   Actually, we can always represent T with two cards as long as |T| <= 2x. Why?\n     Let a be the first card. We can choose a in the range [max(-x, T- x), min(x, T+x)] but actually we require |a|<=x and |T-a|<=x.\n\n     The condition is: a must be in [T-x, T+x] and also in [-x, x]. So we require:\n        max(-x, T-x) <= min(x, T+x)\n\n     Since |T|<=2x, we have T-x >= -2x -x = -3x? Wait, let me correct: actually we know |T|<=2x, so T is between -2x and 2x.\n\n     Then, T-x is between -2x-x = -3x and 2x-x = x, and similarly T+x is between -2x+x=-x and 2x+x=3x.\n\n     The intersection of [T-x, T+x] and [-x, x] is non-empty because |T|<=2x, so the entire interval [T-x, T+x] is contained within [-3x, 3x] and we only care about the part in [-x,x]. \n\n     Actually, we require that there exists an integer a in [-x,x] such that T - a is in [-x,x]. That is, a must be in [T-x, T+x] ∩ [-x,x]. \n\n     The length of the interval [T-x, T+x] is 2x, and the interval [-x,x] has length 2x. Since |T|<=2x, the two intervals overlap. In fact, the entire interval [T-x, T+x] is contained in [-3x,3x] and we are taking the intersection with [-x,x]. \n\n     But note: we can always choose a = min(max(T-x, -x), x) and then check if |T - a| <= x. However, because |T|<=2x, we have:\n\n        If T is positive, then a can be at least T-x, but T-x might be negative? Actually, since T<=2x, T-x <= x, and T-x >= -x? Not necessarily: if T is negative, then T-x is negative and might be below -x.\n\n     Alternatively, note that the minimal requirement for two cards is that |T|<=2x. Then we can always find two cards.\n\n     Example: T=3, x=2 -> then we cannot form 3 with two cards because 2+1=3, but wait: 1 is allowed because |1|<=2. So yes, we can. Similarly, T=-3: -2-1=-3.\n\n     But wait, what if T=2x+1? Then |T|=2x+1 which is >2x -> not allowed. So indeed we require |T|<=2x.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use more than two cards. \n\n The general problem: Represent T with k cards, each in [-x, x]. \n\n Conditions:\n\n 1. The total sum must be T.\n 2. Each card is at least -x and at most x.\n\n The necessary condition is that the total sum T must satisfy:\n    -k*x <= T <= k*x\n\n And then, we must check if we can form T with k cards.\n\n But note: we can also use zeros. However, the key is that we can adjust the cards by 1. \n\n Actually, with k cards, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x and T ≡ s (mod 1) ? But since we are using integers, and we can use any integers, the parity condition doesn't matter because we can use zeros and ones arbitrarily.\n\n However, wait: consider k=1. Then we can form T if and only if |T|<=x.\n\n For k=2: we can form T if |T|<=2*x. But note: we can form every integer T in [-2*x, 2*x]? \n\n   Yes, because we can use two cards. For example, if T is even, we can use two cards of T/2 (if |T/2|<=x). But if T is odd, we can use one card for floor(T/2) and the other for ceil(T/2) as long as both are in [-x,x]. \n\n   Actually, the set of achievable sums with two cards is exactly the set of integers from -2*x to 2*x. Why? \n      The minimal sum is -2*x, the maximal is 2*x. And the step is 1 because we can change one card by 1 and the other adjusts by 0 (or vice versa). \n\n   Example: to get 2*x-1: use (x, x-1) -> sum=2*x-1.\n\n   Similarly, to get 2*x: (x, x) -> 2*x.\n\n   So two cards can form every integer in [-2*x, 2*x].\n\n Similarly, for three cards: we can form every integer from -3*x to 3*x.\n\n But wait, is that true? \n\n   With three cards, the minimal sum is -3*x, the maximal is 3*x. And we can form every integer in between? \n\n   We can: for example, to form T (with |T|<=3*x), we can use the following:\n\n   Let a1, a2, a3 be chosen arbitrarily. We can start with (0,0,0) and then adjust by ±1. But note, we are constrained by the absolute value.\n\n   However, we can use the same idea: the set of achievable sums with k cards is all integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n Why is that?\n\n   Base case: k=1 -> [-x, x] (which is consecutive integers? Actually, no: the integers from -x to x are consecutive, but if x is integer, then yes. But note: x is integer, so the integers from -x to x are consecutive.\n\n   Now, assume that with k cards we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x. Then with k+1 cards, we can form:\n\n        { t + d : t in [-k*x, k*x] and d in [-x, x] }\n\n   The minimum is -k*x -x = -(k+1)*x, the maximum is k*x + x = (k+1)*x.\n\n   Now, is every integer in between achieved?\n\n        We know that t runs over every integer from -k*x to k*x, and d runs over every integer from -x to x.\n\n        Then the set of sums is the union of intervals [t-d_min, t-d_max] for each t, but actually we are adding d to t.\n\n        Actually, the set is the Minkowski sum of the set [-k*x, k*x] (integers) and [-x, x] (integers).\n\n        The Minkowski sum of two sets of integers is the set of all integers from -k*x-x to k*x+x.\n\n        But note: the set [-k*x, k*x] is consecutive, and [-x,x] is consecutive, and the Minkowski sum of two consecutive sets of integers is consecutive? \n\n        Yes, because the steps are 1. \n\n   Therefore, by induction, for k>=1, we can form every integer T with |T|<=k*x.\n\n So the problem reduces to:\n\n   Let T = -S (the current sum of the found cards). We wish to find the minimum k (nonnegative integer) such that:\n\n        |T| <= k*x.\n\n   Then, the answer is k.\n\n However, note: we might already have a sum S=0, then T=0, then k=0.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\", meaning we are adding k cards.\n\n However, consider the example:\n\n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n   Here, n=3, x=2, and the cards are [-1,1,2]. The sum S = -1+1+2 = 2.\n   Then T = -2.\n\n   Condition: |T| = 2 <= k*2.\n\n   The smallest k satisfying 2 <= 2*k is k=1 (because 2<=2*1 -> true). So answer is 1.\n\n   Another example: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n\n   Sum S = -4, so T = 4.\n\n   Condition: 4 <= k*3. \n\n   k=1: 4<=3 -> false.\n   k=2: 4<=6 -> true. So answer is 2.\n\n But wait, the sample output for the second example is 2.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says: \n        \"In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2.\"\n\n So our reasoning matches.\n\n But wait, is there a catch?\n\n Consider: what if T is 0? Then k=0. That's correct.\n\n However, what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive. The condition |T|<=k*x is the same as k >= ceil(|T|/x) if |T|>0, but if |T|==0 then k=0.\n\n However, note that k must be an integer and we take the smallest k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if |T|>0, but if |T|==0 then k_min=0.\n\n But note: if |T| is divisible by x, then k_min = |T|//x.\n\n However, even if |T| is not divisible by x, we just need k_min = ceil(|T| / x). \n\n Example: |T|=5, x=2 -> then k_min = ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n But wait, is 3 sufficient? 3*2=6 >=5 -> yes.\n\n But note: we don't require that the cards must be exactly the same, just that the absolute value is at most x.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the above condition (that we can form any integer T with |T|<=k*x) is true, so we only need to satisfy |T|<=k*x.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   Let S = sum(found_cards)\n   Let T = -S\n   Let absT = abs(T)\n\n   Then, we are looking for the smallest integer k>=0 such that k*x >= absT.\n\n   k_min = ceil(absT / x) if absT > 0, but note: if absT==0, then k_min=0.\n\n   However, if absT % x == 0, then k_min = absT // x, else k_min = absT // x + 1.\n\n   But wait: what if absT==0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        if absT == 0:\n            k = 0\n        else:\n            k = (absT + x - 1) // x   # This is ceiling division for positive integers.\n\n   However, note: the condition is k*x >= absT, so k_min is the smallest integer k such that k >= ceil(|T|/x) if we were thinking of real numbers, but note:\n\n        k_min = ceil(|T|/x)   if |T|>0.\n\n   But note: if |T| is 0, then ceil(0/x)=0, so we can write:\n\n        k = 0 if T==0 else ceil(|T|/x)\n\n   However, we must be cautious: if T is negative, we use |T|. Also, if T is positive, same.\n\n   But note: the ceiling of a positive number a divided by x is:\n\n        k = (a + x - 1) // x   for integer a and x, but only when a>0.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if T is not an integer? But T is the negative of the sum of integers, so T is integer.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n\n        S = sum(list)\n        T = -S\n        absT = abs(T)\n\n        if absT == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We need to compute the smallest k such that k*x >= absT\n            # k_min = ceil(absT / x)\n\n            # Since absT and x are positive integers, we can do:\n            if absT % x == 0:\n                k = absT // x\n            else:\n                k = absT // x + 1\n\n            print(k)\n\n But wait, consider the example: \n        Example 1: n=3, x=2, T=-2 -> absT=2, 2%2==0 -> k=2//2=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: n=2, x=3, T=4 (since S=-4) -> absT=4, 4%3=1 -> k=4//3 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, what if absT is 0? Then we skip the else and print 0.\n\n   But wait: what if we have multiple zeros? The problem says we have n found cards, and they can be zeros.\n\n   But note: the input says \"It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\" and n is given.\n\n   However, let's test with another example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n0\" -> then S=0, T=0 -> absT=0 -> output 0. Correct.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n1\" -> S=1, T=-1 -> absT=1, then k = ceil(1/1)=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a sum that is very large? \n\n        Example: n=1, x=1, and the card is 1 -> then we need one card: -1. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and we are only considering the absolute value condition.\n\n   But is that sufficient? \n\n        The condition is that we can form T with k cards (each absolute value <=x) if and only if |T| <= k*x.\n\n        And we have shown by induction that the set of achievable sums is exactly the integers in [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   However, note: sometimes we might use negative numbers. But the absolute value condition is symmetric.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        T = -total\n        absT = abs(T)\n\n        if absT == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Calculate k = ceil(|T| / x)\n            # Using integer arithmetic: \n            k = (absT + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait, let me check the ceiling division: \n\n        ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive integers a and b.\n\n        Example: a=2, b=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> correct.\n        Example: a=3, b=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, note that if absT is 0, we handled separately. But we can avoid the if by:\n\n        k = (absT + x - 1) // x   if absT !=0, but if absT==0 then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1, which it is). So we can simply do:\n\n        k = (absT + x - 1) // x\n\n        But wait: if absT==0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. Since x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0 (because x-1 < x). So yes.\n\n        Therefore, we can write without the if:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        T = -total\n        absT = abs(T)\n        # If absT is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = 0, which is correct.\n        k = (absT + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   Let me test with absT=0: \n        k = (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> for x>=1, this is 0 (floor division). \n\n   However, note: if x=1, then (0+1-1)//1 = 0//1 = 0 -> correct.\n        if x=2, then (0+2-1)//2 = 1//2 = 0 (in Python, 1//2 is 0) -> correct.\n\n   So the code becomes:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        absT = abs(-s)   # which is abs(s) actually? Because T = -s, so abs(T)=abs(s). But wait: \n        Actually, T = -s, then |T| = |s|. So we can also compute:\n\n        absT = abs(s)   # because |T| = |s|\n\n        But wait, that's the same as the absolute value of the original sum.\n\n        However, note: T = -s, so |T| = |s|. So we can just use abs(s).\n\n        Therefore, we can simplify:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        absT = abs(s)   # because we need to balance the sum to zero, so the deficit is |s|\n        k = (absT + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait, let's check: \n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            s = (-1+1+2)=2, absT=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            s = -4, absT=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: why did we use absT = abs(s)? \n\n        Explanation: We are starting with sum s. We need to add cards that sum to -s, so the deficit is |s|. The absolute value of the deficit is |s|.\n\n   Therefore, the program:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        # If deficit is 0, then we need 0 cards.\n        # Otherwise, we need at least ceil(deficit/x) cards.\n\n        # Using integer ceiling division: (deficit + x - 1) // x\n\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait: is that always true?\n\n   Let me think: what if the deficit is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 -> correct.\n\n   However, consider: what if the deficit is very small, say 1, and x=1 -> (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says that the cards we can use have absolute value at most x. \n\n   There is one more catch: the above reasoning assumed that we can form any integer T with absolute value <= k*x. \n\n   However, note: the cards we are adding can be any integer between -x and x, including negative and positive. \n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1? Then we need one card of -1 (if s=1, then we need to add -1) -> correct.\n\n   But what if the deficit is 1 and x=2? Then k=(1+2-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct.\n\n   However, consider deficit=3 and x=2: \n        k = (3+2-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> correct, because 2 cards: 2 and 1 (but wait, 2+1=3, but we need to add cards that sum to -3 (if s=3) or 3 (if s=-3)? \n\n        Actually, if s=3, then we need to add cards that sum to -3. We can use two cards: -2 and -1 -> sum=-3. \n\n        But note: the deficit is 3 (absolute value). The condition is that we can form -3 with two cards (each card in [-2,2])? \n\n        Yes: -2 and -1 are both in [-2,2] and their sum is -3.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if deficit=1 and x=1000? Then k= (1+1000-1)//1000 = 1000//1000=1 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, consider a deficit that is 0.5? But deficit is an integer because s is the sum of integers.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the cards found have integers (so s is integer) and x is integer.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait: what if deficit is 0? Then k=0, which is correct.\n\n   However, there's a twist: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. \n\n   And we are allowed to use as many as we want. \n\n   But note: the above calculation gives the minimal k such that k*x >= deficit, and we have shown that k cards are sufficient.\n\n   However, is it possible that we can use fewer than k cards by using negative and positive together? \n\n   Actually, the condition |T|<=k*x is necessary and sufficient. And we have proven that with k cards we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is the ceiling of deficit/x.\n\n   But wait, there's an alternative: sometimes we might not need to use the absolute value condition in the way we did. \n\n   However, note: the deficit is |s|, and we require the sum of the additional cards to be -s (so absolute value deficit). \n\n   And the minimal number of cards is the smallest k such that k*x >= deficit, because:\n\n        The maximum absolute value we can cancel with k cards is k*x (if we use all cards with the same sign as needed).\n\n        For example, if deficit is 5 and x=2, then we need at least ceil(5/2)=3 cards. Why? Because 2 cards can only cancel up to 4 in absolute value.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we can use both positive and negative to our advantage? \n\n        Example: deficit=5, x=2. We need to form -5 (if s=5). \n\n        We can use three cards: \n            -2, -2, -1 -> sum=-5.\n\n        But note: we could also use two cards? Two cards: maximum negative we can get is -4, so no.\n\n        But wait, what if we use a mix of positive and negative? \n\n        Actually, we are trying to get a negative total of -5. We can use:\n\n            Option: use two cards: one positive and one negative? But that would give a smaller absolute total.\n\n        However, we are only concerned with the absolute total we need to cancel. The goal is to get -5. \n\n        The minimal k is determined by the fact that the total absolute value we can assign (if we use all negative) is k*x.\n\n        But note: the condition is that the sum of the additional cards must be -5. \n\n        The minimal k is the smallest k such that k*x >= 5. \n\n        Why? Because if we use k cards, the most negative we can get is -k*x. To get -5, we require -k*x <= -5, i.e., k*x>=5.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is necessary.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: the example in the problem statement was:\n\n        Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n        Our code:\n\n            For the first: n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, deficit=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 -> output 1.\n            For the second: n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, deficit=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n   It matches.\n\n   But wait, what if the deficit is 0? Then k=0, which is correct.\n\n   One more edge: n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n However, wait: what if the deficit is very large? \n\n        Example: deficit=1000, x=1 -> k= (1000+1-1)//1 = 1000//1=1000 -> correct.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints: n<=1000, x<=1000, and the numbers on the cards are integers with absolute value <=x.\n\n   The maximum deficit is at most 1000*x (since n<=1000, and each card at most x in absolute value, so the maximum absolute sum is 1000*x). \n\n   Then k = (1000*x + x - 1) // x = 1000 + (x-1)//x = 1000 (if x>=1). \n\n   But note: (1000*x + x -1) // x = 1000*x//x + (x-1)//x = 1000 + 0 = 1000, because (x-1)//x is 0 for x>=1.\n\n   Actually, 1000*x + (x-1) is 1000*x + x -1, then dividing by x: 1000*x//x is 1000, and (x-1)//x is 0, so total 1000.\n\n   But wait, we have deficit=1000*x, then k_min = (1000*x + x-1)//x = (1000*x+x-1)//x = 1000 + (x-1)//x = 1000 (if x>=1). \n\n   However, note: 1000*x is the deficit, then k_min = ceil(1000*x/x)=ceil(1000)=1000. Correct.\n\n   But wait, if deficit=1000*x+1, then k_min = ceil((1000*x+1)/x)=ceil(1000 + 1/x)=1001. \n\n        k = (1000*x+1+x-1)//x = (1000*x+x)//x = (1001*x)//x = 1001.\n\n   But wait, 1000*x+1 is the deficit. The minimal k is 1001? \n\n        Condition: k*x>=1000*x+1 -> k>=1000+1/x -> since k must be integer, k>=1001.\n\n   Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note: the deficit is the absolute value of the sum of the found cards. The maximum absolute sum of the found cards is at most 1000*x (since there are 1000 cards, each at most x in absolute value). \n\n   Therefore, the deficit is at most 1000*x, so k_min is at most 1000.\n\n   But wait, if deficit=1000*x, then k_min=1000, which is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the code is efficient and handles all cases.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: There is a possibility of integer overflow? But n<=1000, x<=1000, so maximum deficit is 1000*1000=1000000, which is acceptable for integer arithmetic in Python.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        # If deficit is 0, then k=0. Otherwise, k = ceil(deficit/x)\n        # Using the ceiling division formula for positive integers.\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: the ceiling division formula works for positive integers. But deficit is nonnegative (because we take absolute value).\n\n   This should be safe.\n\n   But wait, what if x=0? The problem states x>=1, so no.\n\n   Therefore, final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: the problem says that the initial set has cards from -x to x. We are allowed to use any of these. \n\n   But note: the above reasoning holds.\n\n   But wait, I see a potential flaw: \n\n        The condition for forming T with k cards is that |T| <= k*x, and we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        However, note: the cards we are adding must be integers between -x and x. \n\n        The proof by induction that we can form every integer in [-k*x, k*x] uses the fact that the Minkowski sum of consecutive integers is consecutive. \n\n        But note: the base case (k=1) is [-x, x] which is consecutive. Then by induction, the k+1 case is the Minkowski sum of [-k*x, k*x] (consecutive) and [-x,x] (consecutive) and the result is consecutive.\n\n        So the set of achievable sums is consecutive integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n        Therefore, the condition |T|<=k*x is necessary and sufficient.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. \n\n   This means we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> deficit=2, k=(2+2-1)//2= 3//2=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> deficit=4, k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0). Correct.\n\n   One more example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n0\" -> deficit=0, k=0 -> output 0. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n1\" -> deficit=1, k=(1+1-1)//1=1//1=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n-1\" -> deficit=1, k=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 1\\n1 1\" -> deficit=2, k=(2+1-1)//1=2//1=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 1\\n1 -1\" -> deficit=0, output 0. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n2 2\" -> deficit=4, k=(4+2-1)//2=5//2=2 (in integer floor division, 5//2=2) -> but wait, 2*2=4, so we need 2 cards: two -2's. Correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n2 1\" -> deficit=3, k=(3+2-1)//2=4//2=2. \n        We need two cards: to get -3. We can use -2 and -1 (both in [-2,2]). So correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n1 1\" -> deficit=2, k=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 (in Python, 3//2=1). \n        But wait: 1 card: we need to get -2. The card must be -2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each additional card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must be equal to the negative of the current sum of the found cards. Let the current sum be `s`. The deficit, which is the absolute value of `s`, must be canceled out by the sum of the additional cards. Each additional card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards canceling this deficit.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by how many times `x` fits into the deficit. Specifically, if the deficit is `d`, then the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of `d / x`. This is because each card can contribute up to `x` in absolute value towards reducing the deficit.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the absolute value of the sum of the found cards (the deficit). The minimal number of cards is then computed using integer arithmetic to find the ceiling of the division of the deficit by `x`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the list of found cards to compute their sum, which is O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of cards. The subsequent calculations are constant time operations, making the overall approach efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    deficit = abs(s)\n    k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line contains `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. The absolute value of this sum (`deficit`) represents how much we need to adjust the total sum to zero.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards required is calculated using the formula `(deficit + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of `deficit / x` without using floating-point arithmetic.\n4. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of additional cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
