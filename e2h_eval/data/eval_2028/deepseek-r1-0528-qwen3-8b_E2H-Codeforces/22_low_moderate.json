After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m marks for a student).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject (column) what is the maximum mark. But note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark for a subject. However, if a subject has maximum mark 'max_mark', then every student who got that mark in that subject is considered best at that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject (column) in which he has the maximum mark (i.e., he is one of the best in that subject).\n\n 5. However, note: a student can be best in multiple subjects, but we only need one.\n\n Approach:\n - First, we can precompute for each subject (column) the maximum mark.\n   Let's have a list `max_marks` of length m, where `max_marks[j]` is the maximum mark (as character) in column j.\n\n - Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j: \n        gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n   If we find at least one such j, then student i is successful.\n\n 6. Count the number of students that satisfy the above condition.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Step 1: n=3, m=3\n   Step 2: The gradebook is:\n        ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   Step 3: For each subject (column):\n        Subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        Subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        Subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Actually wait, let me write the example correctly:\n\n   The example input is given as a string: '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'\n\n   So the three students have marks:\n        Student0: \"223\" -> [2,2,3]\n        Student1: \"232\" -> [2,3,2]\n        Student2: \"112\" -> [1,1,2]\n\n   Now, for each subject:\n        Subject0: [2,2,1] -> max = 2\n        Subject1: [2,3,1] -> max = 3\n        Subject2: [3,2,2] -> max = 3\n\n   Now check each student:\n        Student0: \n            subject0: 2==2 -> yes, so successful.\n        Student1:\n            subject0: 2==2 -> yes, so successful.\n        Student2:\n            subject0: 1 !=2 -> no.\n            subject1: 1 !=3 -> no.\n            subject2: 2 !=3 -> no. -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n But wait, the example says:\n        Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n        Output: ['2', '3']\n\n   Second sample:\n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Marks:\n            Student0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n            Student1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n            Student2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\n        For each subject:\n            Subject0: [9,1,1] -> max=9\n            Subject1: [1,1,1] -> max=1\n            Subject2: [7,8,1] -> max=8\n            Subject3: [2,2,1] -> max=2\n            Subject4: [8,8,1] -> max=8\n\n        Check each student:\n            Student0:\n                subject0: 9==9 -> yes.\n            Student1:\n                subject0: 1 !=9 -> no.\n                subject1: 1==1 -> yes.\n            Student2:\n                subject0: 1 !=9 -> no.\n                subject1: 1==1 -> yes.\n\n        So all three are successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Read the first line: split to get n and m.\n  Then read the next n lines.\n\n  We can do:\n\n     ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the first line to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Then read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks across m subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps identify the benchmark for being the best in that subject.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: The total count of successful students is printed as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        gradebook.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks_per_subject = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_mark = max(col)\n        max_marks_per_subject.append(max_mark)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks_per_subject[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input lines from standard input. The first line contains the dimensions (number of students and subjects). Subsequent lines contain each student's marks as a string of digits.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the program checks all student marks to determine the highest value. This is stored in a list `max_marks_per_subject`.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student, the program checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If found, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Result Output**: The total count of successful students is printed. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring accurate identification of successful students. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful.",
