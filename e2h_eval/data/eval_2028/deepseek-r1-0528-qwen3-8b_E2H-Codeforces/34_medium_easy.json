And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me recalc: the problem says \"average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\"\n\n But note: the example input has two weeks, so we are to compute the average of the two week averages?\n Actually, no: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n What is 9? \n If we look at the two weeks: \n   Week1: 3.5, Week2: 5.5 -> average of these two is (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 4.5, but that's not 9.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the average over all the days in the entire record, but considering each week separately? \n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\"\n\n But note: the example calculation in the problem says: \n   \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is\"\n\n And they don't show the result, but the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Actually, let's compute the total sleep and then divide by the total number of days? That would be the overall average.\n\n Total sleep = 3 + 4 + 7 = 14\n Number of days = 3, so average per day = 14/3 ≈ 4.666... which is not 9.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the entire set of weeks (each week is k consecutive days) and we want the average of the sleep time over the entire record, but weighted by the fact that each day is counted once?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". But then they say there are n-k+1 weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" gives 10.0000000000.\n\n How many weeks? n-k+1 = 1-1+1 = 1. The week is one day: [10]. So the average per week is 10. And that is the answer.\n\n Now the example \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> output 28964.2857142857\n\n There are 7 weeks. Each week is two days.\n\n We need to compute the average per week over the 7 weeks.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", meaning we are to compute the average of the weekly totals?\n\n However, if we do that, we would take the sum of all weekly totals and divide by the number of weeks.\n\n But wait: the example with two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7] -> total sleep over all weeks is 3+4 + 4+7 = 3+4+4+7 = 18, and number of weeks is 2, so average is 9.\n\n So the procedure is:\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep = sum( a[i] for i from 0 to n-1 ) * (how many times each day appears?) \n\n However, note: each day is included in multiple weeks? Actually, the first day is only in the first week, the second day is in the first and second week, ... until the last day.\n\n But wait: the example [3,4,7] with k=2: \n   Day0: appears in week0 (first week) -> once.\n   Day1: appears in week0 and week1 -> twice.\n   Day2: appears in week1 -> once.\n\n So the total_sleep over all weeks is: 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.\n\n Then the average per week is 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n So the problem is: we are to compute the average per week, but note that the entire record is broken down into overlapping windows of length k, and the total sleep over all weeks is the sum of each day multiplied by the number of weeks that include it.\n\n How to compute the total sleep over all weeks without iterating each week (which would be O(n) per week, too slow for n,k up to 200000)?\n\n We can use a sliding window and prefix sums.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   We want to compute S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of weeks containing day i)\n\n   For day i (0-indexed), the number of weeks containing day i is:\n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)   [actually, the week must start from j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, but also j from 0 to n-k]\n        Actually, the week starts at index j (from 0 to n-k) and covers j to j+k-1.\n        Condition: j <= i and j+k-1 >= i  => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n        But j must be at least 0 and at most n-k.\n\n        Therefore, the number of weeks containing day i is: min(i+1, n-k+1, k, ...) \n\n        Actually, we can think: \n            The first week that includes day i is when j = max(0, i - k + 1) [but wait, j must be <= i and >= i-k+1, but also j>=0 and j<=n-k]\n\n        Alternatively, note that the day i is included in the weeks that start from j0 = max(0, i - k + 1) to j1 = min(i, n-k).\n\n        So the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1, but note: if i < n-k then j1 = i, else j1 = n-k.\n\n        However, we can also see that the count is:\n            count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, the condition for a week starting at j to include day i is: j <= i <= j+k-1.\n        => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n        The smallest j is j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n        The largest j is j_max = min(i, n-k)   [because j cannot exceed n-k]\n\n        Then count_i = max(0, j_max - j_min + 1)\n\n        But note: j_min = max(0, i-k+1) and j_max = min(i, n-k)\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, i=0: \n            j_min = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n            j_max = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n            count_0 = 0-0+1 = 1.\n\n        i=1:\n            j_min = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            j_max = min(1,1)=1\n            count_1 = 1-0+1 = 2.\n\n        i=2:\n            j_min = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            j_max = min(2,1)=1\n            count_2 = 1-1+1=1.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   However, note that we have to do this for every i from 0 to n-1, and n can be up to 200000. Then we would do an O(n) loop, and inside we do O(1) calculations, so overall O(n). But then we multiply a[i] by count_i and sum them up.\n\n   But wait: is there a simpler way? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the idea of prefix sums and then use a sliding window to compute the total sleep.\n\n   However, note: the total sleep over all weeks is the sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (sum_{i=j}^{j+k-1} a[i])\n\n   We can precompute the prefix sum array P, where P[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1}, then the sum for week starting at j is P[j+k]-P[j].\n\n   Then total_sleep = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (P[j+k]-P[j])\n\n   Then the average per week is total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n   But wait, is that the same as our previous method?\n\n   Let's test with n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n   Precompute P: \n        P[0]=0\n        P[1]=3\n        P[2]=3+4=7\n        P[3]=3+4+7=14\n\n   Then:\n        j=0: P[0+2]-P[0]=P[2]-P[0]=7-0=7\n        j=1: P[1+2]-P[1]=P[3]-P[1]=14-3=11\n\n   Then total_sleep = 7+11 = 18.\n\n   Then average per week = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   So yes, we can compute total_sleep by:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sleep += (prefix[j+k] - prefix[j])\n\n   But note: the prefix array is of length n+1, so we can do:\n\n        P = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        Then for j from 0 to n-k:\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n   However, we can also use a different approach: \n\n        total_sleep = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n]-P[n-k])\n\n        But note: we can rewrite this as:\n\n        total_sleep = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n   And we can precompute prefix sums for the prefix array P, but that might be overkill.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that:\n\n        total_sleep = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n]-P[n-k])\n\n        = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n   Now, how to compute the sum of P from index k to n? and the sum of P from index 0 to n-k?\n\n   But note: P is the prefix sum of a. \n\n   However, we already have P. So we can precompute the entire P, and then use two loops? But note, we already did one loop to build P.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire P and then summing specific parts by using a sliding window on the original array?\n\n   But the above direct summation over j from 0 to n-k is O(n) and n can be 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the constraints say n and k up to 200000, so n-k+1 can be up to 200000, and we are doing a loop of 200000, which is acceptable in Python if we write it in C++/Java it's fine, but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n   But note: we are already building the prefix array in O(n). Then the next loop is O(n). So total O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, there is a smarter way: \n\n        total_sleep = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (P[j+k] - P[j])\n                  = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n   We can precompute the prefix sum of P (i.e., a 2D prefix) or use two prefix arrays? Actually, we can use the same P array and then compute the sums by:\n\n        part1 = sum(P[i] for i from k to n)   [i.e., from index k to n]\n        part2 = sum(P[i] for i from 0 to n-k)\n\n        total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n   But note: the indices of P: P has indices 0..n.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        part1 = sum(P[i] for i in range(k, n+1))\n        part2 = sum(P[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))\n\n   Then total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n   However, we can also compute the two parts by:\n\n        We have built P, then:\n\n        part1 = 0\n        for i from k to n:\n            part1 += P[i]\n\n        part2 = 0\n        for i from 0 to n-k:\n            part2 += P[i]\n\n   But note: the length of part1 is n - k + 1, and part2 is n-k+1, so two loops of about n steps.\n\n   But note: the entire P array is of length n+1, so we can precompute a prefix_sum_P array for P.\n\n   Actually, we don't need to do two separate loops. We can build an array Q (another prefix) for P, but that is overcomplicating.\n\n   Since we already built P, we can do:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n   This is one loop and is O(n). \n\n   However, we can also use the trick:\n\n        total_sleep = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n   And we can precompute two more arrays: the prefix sum for P (call it Q) so that Q[i] = P0+P1+...+P{i-1} (for Q of length n+2) but then:\n\n        part1 = Q[n+1] - Q[k]   [if Q[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} P[j]]\n        part2 = Q[n-k+1] - Q[0]   [because we want indices 0 to n-k]\n\n   But note: we built P, and then we can build Q for P.\n\n   But wait: we are already going to do two passes (one to build P, one to build Q) and then two more to extract the parts. It's not saving time.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n   This is straightforward and clear.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n, k\n        Read list a of n integers.\n\n        Build P: \n            P[0] = 0\n            for i from 1 to n: P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(0, total_weeks):\n            # j goes from 0 to n-k\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n        Then average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        Format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer is the average per week, and we are calculating the average of the weekly totals.\n\n   But wait: is that the same as the average sleep time per week? \n\n   Actually, note: each week's total is the sum of k days. Then the average per week is (total_sleep) / (number of weeks).\n\n   But wait: the example [3,4,7] with k=2: \n        total_sleep = 18, number of weeks = 2, so average = 9.\n\n   But note: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n   Another example: n=1, k=1, [10]\n        total_weeks = 1\n        P = [0, 10]\n        j=0: P[1]-P[0] = 10\n        average = 10/1 = 10.\n\n   The third example: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        We are told the output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n        n=8, k=2, so total_weeks = 7.\n\n        We'll build P for [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]:\n            P[0]=0\n            P[1]=1\n            P[2]=1+2=3\n            P[3]=3+4=7\n            P[4]=7+100000=100007\n            P[5]=100007+123=100130\n            P[6]=100130+456=100586\n            P[7]=100586+789=101375\n            P[8]=101375+1=101376\n\n        Then total_sleep = \n            j=0: P[2]-P[0]=3-0=3\n            j=1: P[3]-P[1]=7-1=6\n            j=2: P[4]-P[2]=100007-3=100004\n            j=3: P[5]-P[3]=100130-7=100123\n            j=4: P[6]-P[4]=100586-100007=579\n            j=5: P[7]-P[5]=101375-100130=1245\n            j=6: P[8]-P[6]=101376-100586=790\n\n        Sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n\n        Let me add step by step:\n\n          3+6=9\n          9+100004=100013\n          100013+100123=200136\n          200136+579=200715\n          200715+1245=201960\n          201960+790=202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Which matches the example.\n\n   However, note: the above direct loop is O(n) and n can be 200000, which is acceptable in Pyton if we write it efficiently.\n\n   But wait: the problem says n up to 200000, and k from 1 to n. The loop runs (n-k+1) times, which is about 200000. This is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also use a different method to avoid the inner loop by computing the entire total_sleep via the two parts of the prefix array:\n\n        total_sleep = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n   But note: we built P, so we can use:\n\n        part1 = sum(P[i] for i in range(k, n+1))\n        part2 = sum(P[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))\n\n        total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n   But wait, is that equivalent?\n\n        In the direct loop we did: for j from 0 to n-k: P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n        Now, consider the entire array P from 0 to n.\n\n        The direct loop adds: \n            j=0: P[k] - P[0]\n            j=1: P[k+1] - P[1]\n            ...\n            j=n-k: P[n] - P[n-k]\n\n        So the positive terms are: P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]\n        The negative terms are: P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k]\n\n        So yes, total_sleep = (sum_{i=k}^{n} P[i]) - (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} P[i])\n\n   Now, we can compute the two sums by:\n\n        We have the prefix array P of length n+1.\n\n        We can precompute a prefix sum for P (call it Q) such that:\n            Q[i] = P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[i-1]   (so Q has length n+2, with Q[0]=0, Q[1]=P[0], Q[2]=P[0]+P[1], ...)\n\n        Then:\n            sum_{i=k}^{n} P[i] = Q[n+1] - Q[k]\n            sum_{i=0}^{n-k} P[i] = Q[n-k+1] - Q[0]   [since Q[n-k+1] = P[0]+...+P[n-k]]\n\n        But note: Q[i] is defined as the sum of P[0] to P[i-1]. So:\n\n            sum_{i=0}^{m} P[i] = Q[m+1]\n\n        Therefore:\n            part1 = sum_{i=k}^{n} P[i] = Q[n+1] - Q[k]\n            part2 = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} P[i] = Q[n-k+1] - Q[0]   [but Q[0]=0, so part2 = Q[n-k+1]]\n\n        Then total_sleep = (Q[n+1] - Q[k]) - Q[n-k+1]\n\n   However, we can also compute the two parts without building Q for the entire P, by simply having the entire P and then using two for-loops. But then we are back to two O(n) operations.\n\n   But note: building Q is another O(n). \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        # Using the direct loop is clearer and only one loop.\n\n   Considering simplicity and clarity, I choose the direct loop.\n\n   However, note: the direct loop is O(n) and n can be 200000, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait: the direct loop does (n-k+1) iterations, which is about 200000, and in each iteration we do two array lookups and one addition. This is efficient.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Build prefix sum array P of length n+1\n        P = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0.0   # to avoid integer division, but the numbers are integers so we can use float division later.\n\n        # But note: the total_sleep might be an integer, but we are going to divide by an integer and then format to float.\n\n        # We can do:\n        #   for j in range(total_weeks):\n        #       total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n        # But note: j from 0 to total_weeks-1, and j+k from k to n (since j goes from 0 to n-k, then j+k from k to n)\n\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate j from 0 to n-k.\n\n        total_sleep = 0.0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the average to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say that the numbers are integers and the total_sleep and total_weeks are integers, but the division may not be integer.\n\n   But the example outputs have 10 digits.\n\n   But wait: the example \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives 9.0, which is integer.\n\n   This method works.\n\n   But note: the problem says the answer is the average per week. \n\n   However, let me check with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> 9.0\n   Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> 10.0\n   Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> 28964.2857142857\n\n   But wait: the example output for the third example is \"28964.2857142857\", which has 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the example output in the problem statement is given with 10 digits.\n\n   But there's a catch: the total_sleep is computed as an integer? But we are adding integers. Then if the division is not integer, we get a float.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.\"\n\n   We are using double precision, so it's safe.\n\n   However, note: the numbers can be as large as 200000 * 100000 (since a[i] up to 10^5, and n up to 200000, so the maximum value in P is about 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision, but we are doing floating point division). \n\n   But wait: total_sleep can be very large, but the division by (n-k+1) (which is at most 200000) will be a float. We must be cautious because the total_sleep might be huge and lose precision if we use floating point during accumulation.\n\n   However, we are using integers for the prefix array and then converting to float when dividing? Actually, no: the variable total_sleep is initialized as 0.0, but then we are adding integers. But note: in Python, adding an integer to a float will convert the integer to float. So if the numbers are huge, we might lose precision.\n\n   But the maximum total_sleep: \n        The maximum value in P: P[n] = sum(a) <= 200000 * 100000 = 20e9.\n        Then the total_sleep is the sum of (n-k+1) terms, each term being at most 20e9, so total_sleep <= (n-k+1) * 20e9 <= 200000 * 20e9 = 4e15, which is within the range of exact representation for floats? Actually, no: floats have about 15-17 significant decimal digits, but 4e15 is 16-digit number, so we might lose precision.\n\n   However, note: the individual terms are differences of two prefix values (which are integers). The total_sleep is an integer (because each a[i] is integer, so the prefix is integer, and the difference is integer). But we are accumulating as float.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n\n        Then average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But if we use integer arithmetic for total_sleep, then we can avoid floating point until the division.\n\n   Since the numbers can be very large (up to 4e15) and we are doing integer addition, Python integers are fine (arbitrary precision) and then we can convert to float for the division? Or better, do the division as integer division? But the problem requires a real number with 10 decimal digits.\n\n   However, 4e15 is within the range of integers, but when we divide by total_weeks (which is at most 200000) we get a float. But the division of two integers (total_sleep and total_weeks) might be done as float if we use /.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # if total_sleep is integer and total_weeks is integer, then this is float.\n\n   But wait: total_sleep is an integer, total_weeks is an integer.\n\n   However, the problem requires 10 decimal digits. We can use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sleep / total_weeks))\n\n   But if total_sleep is very large, then the float representation might have rounding errors.\n\n   But note: the total_sleep is an integer, and total_weeks is an integer, and we are dividing two integers. The result might not be representable exactly in binary floating point, but the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   However, to avoid precision loss, we can do:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # using float division\n\n   But the numbers are integers, and the division might not be exact, but the error requirement is 1e-6.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   and then format to 10 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the example 3: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857..., and 202750 is divisible by 7? 7*28964 = 202748, remainder 2, so it's not an integer. But we are printing 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\".\n\n   Using float division and formatting to 10 decimal places should be safe.\n\n   But note: the total_sleep can be very large (like 4e15) and then dividing by 200000 gives about 2e10, which is still within the range of double precision (which has about 15 decimal digits of precision). So 10 decimal digits is safe.\n\n   However, to avoid floating point inaccuracies in the accumulation, we can keep total_sleep as an integer and then do:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But wait: the accumulation of total_sleep is an integer, so that is exact.\n\n   The only potential issue is the division: but the problem requires at least 6 decimal digits, and we are printing 10, so even if there is a small error in the float representation, 10 decimal places might show it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use decimal for the division? But the problem doesn't require that.\n\n   Considering the constraints, the maximum total_sleep is 4e15, and the minimum total_weeks is 1. The maximum average is 4e15 / 1 = 4e15, which is too big to represent exactly in float? Actually, no: 4e15 is 4 followed by 15 zeros? No, 4e15 is 4 * 10^15, which is 4000000000000000, which is a 16-digit integer. When converted to float, it loses precision? Actually, no: because float in Python (which is double) can represent integers exactly up to 2^53, which is about 9e15. So 4e15 is within the exact representation range.\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        P = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(total_weeks):\n            total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        P = [0,3,7,14]\n        j=0: 7-0=7\n        j=1: 14-3=11\n        total_sleep = 7+11=18\n        average=18/2=9.0 -> formatted to 9.0000000000\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n        P = [0,10]\n        j=0: 10-0=10\n        average=10/1=10.0 -> 10.0000000000\n\n   Example 3: as above, correct.\n\n   But note: the above code uses an integer for total_sleep. However, the problem constraints say that the sleep times are integers, so total_sleep is integer.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input integers, so yes.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" produces 202750, which is an integer.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   But note: the problem says the answer is the average per week, and we are calculating the average of the weekly totals (each week total is the sum of k days). This is the same as the average sleep time per week.\n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". And we are averaging the weekly totals.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say to average the sleep time per day then multiply by k. It says \"consider k consecutive days as a week\", and then the average is over the weeks.\n\n   So we are correct.\n\n   But wait: the example in the problem says: \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is\" and then they don't specify, but we calculated 9.0.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, note: the above code uses a loop that runs (n-k+1) times. In worst-case, k=1, then we run n times, which is 200000. This is acceptable.\n\n   Let me test with k=1 and n=200000, but the problem says n,k up to 200000.\n\n   We can also optimize by avoiding the inner loop by using the two-part formula, but the current method is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n   But note: the direct loop is actually:\n\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. A week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks to consider. The solution involves efficiently computing the total sleep time across all weeks and then dividing by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subsequences (weeks) of length `k` in the given sequence of sleep times. Each week's total sleep time is the sum of its `k` days. The challenge is to compute this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force method that would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The key observation is that each day's sleep time contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position `i` will be included in all weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. However, instead of calculating each week's sum individually, we use a prefix sum array to compute the total sleep time across all weeks in linear time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep time array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each week starting at index `j`, the sum of sleep times is `P[j + k] - P[j]`. Summing these values for all valid starting indices `j` gives the total sleep time across all weeks.\n   - **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sleep time by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves:\n   - Building the prefix sum array in O(n) time.\n   - Iterating over each week to compute the total sleep time in O(n) time (since there are `n - k + 1` weeks).\n   - The overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    P = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep = 0\n    for j in range(total_weeks):\n        total_sleep += P[j+k] - P[j]\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of a week `k`, and the sequence of sleep times for `n` days.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array `P` is constructed where each element `P[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep time array. This allows efficient computation of subarray sums.\n3. **Total Sleep Time Calculation**: For each week starting at index `j`, the sum of sleep times is computed as `P[j + k] - P[j]`. These values are accumulated into `total_sleep`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing `total_sleep` by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`). The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the prefix sum array to avoid recalculating subarray sums repeatedly, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
