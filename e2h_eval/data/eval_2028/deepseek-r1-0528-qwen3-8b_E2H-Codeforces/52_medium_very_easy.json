Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (number of new candles) and b (number of old candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Each hour we can light one candle (each candle burns for an hour).\n   After burning, each candle becomes an old candle.\n   Also, from every 'b' old candles, we can create a new candle.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   old_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burnt candles (which become old) to make more new ones.\n\n Steps:\n   We start by lighting all the new candles we have. Then we burn them and get some old candles.\n\n But note: we can also use the old candles to make more new ones, which then can be burned to give even more old candles.\n\n We can simulate:\n   hours = 0\n   new = a\n   old = 0\n\n   while new > 0:\n        # Burn all the new candles\n        hours += new\n        old += new\n        new = 0   # because we used all the new candles for burning\n\n        # Now, with the old candles, we can make more new ones\n        # How many new candles? old // b, and the remaining old candles after making new ones will be old % b\n        # But note: when we make new candles, we use b old candles per new candle, so we do:\n        #   new = old // b\n        #   old = old % b\n\n        # However, we don't necessarily have to set new=0 at the beginning of the loop if we are going to account for old candles?\n        # Alternatively, we can think: \n        #   We start with 'new' new candles, then we burn them and get 'new' old candles.\n        #   Then we use as many as possible to form new candles: new = (old // b) and update old = old % b.\n\n   But wait: in the example \"4 2\": \n        Start: new=4, old=0, hours=0\n        Step1: burn 4 -> hours=4, old=4\n        Then, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and old becomes 0 (since 4 % 2 = 0)\n        Then, we set new=2, and then burn these 2 -> hours=6, old=2\n        Then, we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and old becomes 0\n        Then, burn 1 -> hours=7, old=1 -> then 1//2=0, so done.\n\n   However, note: we don't have to reset new to zero at the beginning of the loop if we are going to use the old ones to make new ones. Actually, we can structure the loop differently.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = a\n   leftover = 0\n   while total >= b:\n        # Burn 'total' candles: they will give 'total' old candles, but we already have 'leftover' old candles?\n        # Actually, we need to combine the leftover from previous steps.\n\n   Let's reframe:\n\n   We start with a new candles. We can burn them and then use the burnt ones (and any leftovers) to make more.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   recycle = 0\n\n   But note: we can only use the burnt candles (from the ones we just burned) and any leftovers from previous recycling.\n\n   Actually, let me consider:\n\n   We have two types: new and old (recycled). We start with a new.\n\n   Process:\n     While we have at least 'b' candles (whether new or old? Actually, we cannot use new ones to recycle until they are burned? \n     But note: we burn a candle and then it becomes old. So we can only use the old ones for recycling.\n\n   However, the problem says: when Vasily lights up a new candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. Then, from b went out candles, he can make a new one.\n\n   So the process is sequential: we must burn a candle to get an old one, and then we can use old ones to make new ones.\n\n   But note: the new ones we make from old ones can be burned and then become old ones.\n\n   Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a   # this includes both new and old? Actually, no. Initially, we have 'a' new candles. Then we burn them, and then we have a's worth of old candles.\n\n   Actually, we can think of:\n\n   total_candles_available = a   (all new)\n   hours_burned = 0\n\n   Then, while total_candles_available >= b:\n        # We can burn 'b' candles to make one new candle? Not exactly. We can use any number of old candles to make new ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate by keeping track of the total candles we have (both new and recycled) but then we have to account for the burning.\n\n   Another approach:\n\n   We know that initially we have 'a' candles. We burn them and get 'a' old candles. Then we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we are left with a % b old candles.\n\n   Then, we can burn the new candles we made (floor(a/b)) and add their burn time (so we add floor(a/b) hours) and then we get additional floor(a/b) old candles, and then combine with the leftover (a % b) to form the next batch.\n\n   So:\n\n   total_hours = a   (because we burn 'a' candles first)\n   candles = a   (the initial new ones)\n\n   Then, we get from burning the initial candles: we have 'a' old candles.\n\n   Then, we can make new_candles = a // b, and leftover_old = a % b.\n\n   Then, we can burn these new_candles: so we add new_candles to total_hours, and then we get new_candles old candles (so now we have leftover_old + new_candles old candles).\n\n   Then, we repeat: from the current old candles, we can make new_candles = (leftover_old + new_candles) // b, and leftover_old = (leftover_old + new_candles) % b.\n\n   But note: we are effectively combining the old candles from multiple batches.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n   total = a\n   hours = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, we started by burning the initial a, so we have a old candles. Then we make a//b new ones and a % b leftover.\n\n   Then we burn the new ones (a//b) so we add a//b to hours, and then we have leftover + a//b old candles.\n\n   Then, we set a = a//b, and leftover = leftover + a//b % b? Actually, we did:\n\n        leftover_initial = a % b   (from the first batch)\n        then we make new_candles = a // b\n\n        Then we update: total_old = leftover_initial + new_candles\n        Then, we set a = new_candles (for the next batch) and leftover = total_old % b, but actually we can compute:\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        hours += a // b\n        leftover = (a % b) + (a // b)   # but wait, we are going to reuse the old ones from the burned new ones?\n\n        Then, we set a = (a // b)  [but then we have leftover old candles] and then we can use the leftover to make more?\n\n        However, we must account for the fact that we can combine the leftover from the previous step and the new burned candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_candles = a   (initial new)\n        total_hours = 0\n        old = 0\n\n        while total_candles > 0:\n            # Burn all the new candles\n            total_hours += total_candles\n            old += total_candles\n            total_candles = 0   # we use them all\n\n            # Now, from old candles, we can make more new ones\n            # Each b old candles make one new candle\n            if old >= b:\n                # How many new candles can we make?\n                new_made = old // b\n                total_candles = new_made   # these are the new candles we can use\n                old = old % b   # the leftover old candles\n\n        But wait, is that correct? Let's try with \"4 2\":\n\n        Step0: total_candles=4, old=0, total_hours=0.\n        Loop1: total_candles=4>0 -> total_hours=4, old=4, total_candles=0.\n               4>=2 -> new_made=2, total_candles=2, old=0.\n        Loop2: total_candles=2>0 -> total_hours=6, old=2, total_candles=0.\n               2>=2 -> new_made=1, total_candles=1, old=0.\n        Loop3: total_candles=1>0 -> total_hours=7, old=1, total_candles=0.\n               1<2 -> break.\n        Output:7 -> correct.\n\n        Now try \"6 3\":\n\n        Step0: total_candles=6, old=0, total_hours=0.\n        Loop1: total_hours=6, old=6, total_candles=0.\n               6>=3 -> new_made=2, total_candles=2, old=0.\n        Loop2: total_candles=2>0 -> total_hours=8, old=2, total_candles=0.\n               2<3 -> break.\n        Output:8 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the above simulation uses the old candles immediately after burning the new ones. This is valid because the burned candles are the old ones.\n\n        But wait, what about mixing? The problem doesn't specify that we have to use the old ones separately. The process is: we can use any old candles (from any burned candles) to make new ones.\n\n        The above algorithm does:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            total_candles = a\n            old = 0\n\n            while total_candles > 0:\n                total_hours += total_candles\n                old += total_candles\n                total_candles = 0\n\n                # Then, we use old candles to make new ones: total_candles = old // b\n                # And then set old = old % b\n\n        But note: in the first iteration, we burn the initial a and then use the old ones (which are a) to make a//b new ones.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, we can optimize by not iterating one by one, but using a formula.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a\n        while current > 0:\n            total_hours += current\n            # Now, we get current old candles\n            # Then, we can make current // b new candles, and leave current % b old candles\n            current = current // b   # because we use the old ones to make new ones (current // b)\n            # But wait, we have leftover old candles from the modulus, but we didn't account for them separately.\n\n        This simple version would not account for leftover old candles that might be used in the next cycle.\n\n        Example \"4 2\" with this:\n\n            current = 4\n            total_hours = 4\n            current = 4//2 = 2\n            total_hours = 6\n            current = 2//2 = 1\n            total_hours = 7\n            current = 1//2 = 0 -> stop.\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, when we set current = 2, we then burn 2 and get 2 old candles, then we make 2//2=1, and then we burn 1 and get 1 old candle. But in the above, we don't account for the leftover from the old candles.\n\n        Actually, the above simple version does not account for the leftover. Because when we do:\n\n            current = current // b\n\n        we are effectively ignoring the leftover. But in the problem, we can combine leftovers from different batches.\n\n        However, note that the process is: after burning the current batch, we have 'current' old candles. Then we make as many new candles as possible: floor(current / b). But we also have leftover old candles (current % b) that we cannot use until we burn more candles (from other batches).\n\n        But the above simple version doesn't keep the leftover. So we must account for the leftover.\n\n        We can modify:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            current = a\n            leftover = 0\n\n            while current > 0 or leftover >= b:   # But wait, we can have leftover from previous steps and we haven't burned them yet.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine the leftover from the old candles with the next batch.\n\n        Actually, the problem is that we are burning the current batch and then using the old ones (which include the leftover from before) to make new ones.\n\n        But in the simulation we did earlier (with two variables: total_candles and old) is straightforward.\n\n        However, we can also use a mathematical approach:\n\n        Let n0 = a\n        Then, the total hours is at least n0.\n\n        Then, from the n0 burnt candles, we get n0 old candles, which can be converted into k1 = n0 // b new candles, and we have r1 = n0 % b old candles left.\n\n        Then, we burn k1 candles, adding k1 hours, and then we have r1 + k1 old candles, which gives k2 = (r1 + k1) // b new candles, and r2 = (r1+k1) % b.\n\n        Then, we burn k2, and so on.\n\n        We can write:\n\n        total = a\n        old = 0\n        while a > 0:\n            total += a // b   # Wait, no, because we are burning the a and then getting a old candles, then converting a//b to new ones.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total = a\n        candles = a\n        while candles >= b:\n            # We can use 'candles' to make candles//b new ones, but wait, we are going to burn the candles and then use the old ones?\n            # Actually, we are burning the candles and then getting candles old candles, which we convert to candles//b new ones.\n\n        But note: we are burning the candles and then we get candles old candles, so:\n\n            total += candles   # because we burn all the candles we have (which are 'candles') and get candles hours\n            candles //= b\n            # But then we have leftover: candles % b? \n\n        However, we have to account for the leftover. The above doesn't.\n\n        So, let me stick to the simulation with two variables: total_candles and old.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints are small (a and b between 1 and 1000). So even a while loop that runs at most a few hundred times is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also do without a loop by using a formula, but the iterative method is clear.\n\n        Code with two variables:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total_candles = a\n        old = 0\n        hours = 0\n\n        while total_candles > 0:\n            # Burn all the new candles\n            hours += total_candles\n            old += total_candles\n            total_candles = 0\n\n            # Now, use old candles to make new ones\n            if old >= b:\n                # How many new candles can we make?\n                new_candles = old // b\n                # The remaining old candles\n                leftover = old % b\n                total_candles = new_candles\n                old = leftover\n\n        print(hours)\n\n        Let me test with a=1, b=2: \n            total_candles=1, old=0, hours=0.\n            Loop: hours=1, old=1, total_candles=0.\n            Then, 1<2 -> so no new candles. Output 1.\n\n        But according to the problem: \n            We have 1 candle. We burn it for 1 hour. Then we have 1 old candle. Since b=2, we cannot make a new candle. So total hours=1 -> correct.\n\n        Another test: a=2, b=2:\n            total_candles=2, old=0, hours=0.\n            Loop1: hours=2, old=2, total_candles=0.\n            Then, 2>=2 -> new_candles=1, leftover=0, so total_candles=1, old=0.\n            Loop2: hours=3, old=1, total_candles=0.\n            Then, 1<2 -> break. Output=3.\n\n        But let's check: \n            Initially 2 candles -> burn for 2 hours, then we have 2 old -> make 1 new -> burn for 1 hour -> then we have 1 old -> cannot make more. Total 3.\n\n        However, wait: the example input \"4 2\" gives 7, and \"6 3\" gives 8.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as two numbers: first sample input is \"4 2\", second is \"6 3\".\n\n        Our code for \"6 3\" gave 8, which matches.\n\n        But wait, the example output for \"4 2\" is 7, which our code gives.\n\n        However, let me check the example \"2 2\": expected is 3, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n            \"For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles\"\n\n        In our simulation, we are burning all the candles we have at once. That is, we are allowed to light as many candles as we have (one per hour, but we can light multiple candles simultaneously? Actually, the problem says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\" and it burns for an hour. Then he can use multiple candles at the same time? \n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that we can only light one candle per hour. It says \"When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out.\" \n\n        And the example: \n            \"For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles\"\n\n        So, in the first four hours, he is lighting four candles (each burning for one hour). \n\n        Therefore, the way we count is: we burn one candle per hour? Or we burn multiple candles in parallel?\n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"Vasily has a candles. When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out.\"\n\n        This implies that we can light multiple candles at the same time (in the same hour) and they all burn for that hour. Then, at the end of the hour, they all go out.\n\n        But note: the example counts 4 hours for the initial 4 candles. This means that we can light up to 'a' candles in the first hour? Actually, no: the example says \"for the first four hours\", meaning four separate hours. \n\n        Let me read the example again: \n            \"Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\"\n\n        And the breakdown: \n            First four hours: burn the initial 4 candles.\n            Then, from the 4 burned candles, make 2 new ones -> burn for two more hours (so total 6 hours so far).\n            Then, from the 2 burned candles (from the two candles we just burned) we make 1 new one -> burn for one more hour (total 7).\n\n        So, the burning is done in separate hours. We cannot burn multiple candles in the same hour? Actually, the problem says: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\". \n\n        The key is: each candle burns for an hour. So if we have multiple candles, we can burn them in separate hours. \n\n        Therefore, the total hours is the sum of the candles we burn one by one (each candle burns for one hour). \n\n        But note: we can also light a candle and then use the old ones to make a new one, but the new one must be lit in a subsequent hour.\n\n        However, the example counts:\n\n            Hour1: light one candle (then we have 3 left and 1 old)\n            Hour2: light another (then 2 left and 2 old)\n            ... \n\n        But wait, the example says \"for the first four hours\" meaning four separate hours. So we burn one candle per hour until we run out.\n\n        Therefore, the initial 4 candles give 4 hours.\n\n        Then, the two new candles (from the first recycling) give 2 hours.\n\n        Then, the one new candle (from the second recycling) gives 1 hour.\n\n        So total 7 hours.\n\n        Our simulation:\n\n            We are burning all the candles at once? Actually, no: we are burning the entire stock in one go? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n            In the first iteration, we set:\n                hours += total_candles   (which is 4) -> meaning we are counting 4 hours.\n\n            Then we use the 4 old candles to make 2 new ones.\n\n            Then we set total_candles = 2, and then we add 2 to hours -> 6.\n\n            Then we use the 2 old candles (from the 2 we just burned) to make 1 new one.\n\n            Then we add 1 to hours -> 7.\n\n        So we are effectively burning all available candles (without regard to the hour-by-hour timing) and then counting the total as the sum of all candles burned.\n\n        This is equivalent to: the total hours is the total number of candles that are ever burned (including the ones made from recycling).\n\n        Why is that? Because each candle burns for one hour.\n\n        Therefore, the simulation is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we can only use the went out (burned) candles to make new ones. And we are accounting for every burned candle.\n\n        So we can also solve by:\n\n            total = a\n            while a >= b:\n                # From a burned candles (which we just got from burning a candles) we can make a//b new ones, and we have a % b leftover.\n                # Then, the total burned candles so far is the original a plus the new ones we make, and then we continue with the new ones and the leftover.\n\n                # But note: we are burning the new ones too, so the total hours is the sum of all candles we burn (which is a + a//b + (a//b)//b + ... )\n\n            However, we must account for the leftover.\n\n            total_candles = a\n            leftover = 0\n            while True:\n                # We can use the leftover and the new ones (if any) to form the next batch?\n                # Actually, we can combine the leftover from the previous batch with the new ones we are about to burn? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a formula:\n\n            total = 0\n            current = a\n            while current:\n                total += current\n                current = current // b + current % b\n\n            But wait, that doesn't match. Let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n                current = 4\n                total +=4 -> 4\n                current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0 =2\n\n                total +=2 -> 6\n                current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1+0 =1\n\n                total +=1 -> 7\n                current = 1//2 + 1%2 = 0+1 =1 -> then total+=1 -> 8, and then current= 0+1=1 -> infinite loop.\n\n            So that doesn't work.\n\n        The correct way to account for leftovers is to keep them and then combine with the new candles from the next batch.\n\n        But note: the new candles we make are from the old ones (which are the leftover from the previous burning). However, the above simulation (with two variables) is clearer.\n\n        Since the constraints are small (a and b at most 1000), the while loop will run at most around log_b(a) * something, which is very small.\n\n        Therefore, we'll use the two-variable simulation.\n\n        However, we can also write it without the inner condition by updating total_candles and old in one go.\n\n        But the code we have is already simple.\n\n        Let me rewrite the code without the inner condition by using the same idea:\n\n        Read input: a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total_candles = a\n        old = 0\n        hours = 0\n\n        while total_candles > 0:\n            hours += total_candles\n            old += total_candles\n            total_candles = old // b\n            old = old % b\n\n        print(hours)\n\n        But wait, let me test with \"4 2\":\n\n            total_candles=4, old=0, hours=0.\n            Loop1: hours=4, old=4, then total_candles=4//2=2, old=0.\n            Loop2: hours=6, old=2, then total_candles=2//2=1, old=0.\n            Loop3: hours=7, old=1, then total_candles=1//2=0, old=1%2=1 -> then condition fails (total_candles=0) so we break.\n\n        This gives 7.\n\n        And \"6 3\":\n\n            total_candles=6, old=0, hours=0.\n            Loop1: hours=6, old=6, total_candles=6//3=2, old=0.\n            Loop2: hours=8, old=2, total_candles=0 (since 2//3=0) -> break.\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we have 2 old candles. Then we set total_candles=0 and break. However, we burned the 2 candles in the second iteration? \n\n        Actually, no: in the second iteration, we are burning the 2 candles (from the 2 new ones we made) and then we get 2 old candles. Then we use those 2 to make 0 new ones and leftover 2. Then we break.\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we did:\n\n            hours += 2   (because we burned the 2 candles) -> so we added 2 to the total.\n\n        But wait, in the code above, the second iteration:\n\n            We start with total_candles=2 (from the first recycling) and old=0 (from the first recycling step, we set old=0 because 6%3=0).\n\n            Then we enter the loop because total_candles=2>0.\n\n            Then we do: hours += 2 -> 6+2=8.\n            Then we set old = 2 (because we burned 2 candles, so we add 2 to old, but wait: old was 0, so now old=2).\n\n            Then we set total_candles = 2//3 = 0, and old = 2 % 3 = 2.\n\n            Then we break.\n\n        But note: we did burn the 2 candles (so we added 2 hours) and then we set old to 2 (from the 2 candles we just burned). Then we use the old=2 to make 0 new ones and set old=2.\n\n        Then we break because total_candles=0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, there is a nuance: in the first iteration, we set old=4 (from the 4 candles we burned) and then we set total_candles=2 (from 4//2) and old=0 (from 4%2). \n\n        Then in the second iteration, we burn the 2 candles (so we add 2 to hours and set old=2). Then we set total_candles=0 (from 2//2=1? wait no, wait: \n\n        Correction: in the code I wrote above, the line:\n\n            total_candles = old // b\n\n        This is done after adding the burned candles to old. But wait, in the first iteration:\n\n            We start: total_candles=4, old=0, hours=0.\n            We burn 4: so we add 4 to hours -> 4, and add 4 to old -> old=4.\n            Then we set total_candles = 4//2 = 2, and old = 4%2=0.\n\n        Then, in the second iteration, we have total_candles=2, old=0.\n\n        Then we burn 2: hours=6, old=2.\n        Then we set total_candles=2//2=1, old=2%2=0.\n\n        Then third iteration: burn 1: hours=7, old=1.\n        Then set total_candles=1//2=0, old=1.\n\n        Then break.\n\n        So the code must be:\n\n            hours += total_candles   # burn the current total_candles\n            old += total_candles      # these become old\n            total_candles = old // b  # the new candles we can make\n            old = old % b             # the leftover old candles\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we set total_candles to 2//2=1 and old to 0, but then we break the loop condition? No, we continue.\n\n        However, in the above code, after updating old and total_candles, we then check the condition for the next iteration (which is total_candles>0). \n\n        But note: the variable 'old' is updated to the remainder, and then we use that old for the next batch.\n\n        However, the above code does not account for the fact that we might have leftover old candles from previous steps? \n\n        Actually, no: because we are updating old to the remainder from the entire old set (which includes the leftovers from previous steps and the ones from the current batch).\n\n        Let me test with \"6 3\" again:\n\n            Step0: total_candles=6, old=0, hours=0.\n            Step1: burn 6 -> hours=6, old=6.\n                    total_candles = 6//3 = 2, old=6%3=0.\n            Step2: burn 2 -> hours=8, old=2.\n                    total_candles = 2//3=0, old=2%3=2.\n            Then the loop condition: total_candles=0 -> break.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we set old=2, but then we break because total_candles=0. However, we have 2 old candles that we cannot use because we don't have enough to make a new candle (we need 3). \n\n        But that's correct.\n\n        However, note: the above code does not account for the leftover from previous steps? Actually, we are including the leftover from the previous steps because we are updating 'old' at the end of each iteration.\n\n        But wait, in the first iteration, we set old=0 (because 6%3=0). Then in the second iteration, we set old=2 (from 2%3). \n\n        However, what if we have leftover from the first iteration? In the first iteration, we set old=0 because 6 is divisible by 3. But what if we had a=7, b=3?\n\n        Let me test a=7, b=3:\n\n            Step0: total_candles=7, old=0, hours=0.\n            Step1: burn 7 -> hours=7, old=7.\n                    total_candles = 7//3 = 2, old=7%3=1.\n            Step2: burn 2 -> hours=9, old=2+1=3? Wait, no: in the code, we are updating old to the remainder from the entire old set (which is 7) and then we set old=1. But wait, no: \n\n            Actually, in the code above, we do:\n\n                hours += total_candles   -> hours=7\n                old += total_candles    -> old=7\n                total_candles = old // b -> 7//3=2\n                old = old % b           -> 7%3=1\n\n            Then, Step2: total_candles=2, old=1, hours=7.\n            Then we burn 2: hours=9, old=1+2=3 -> but wait, no: the code does:\n\n                hours += total_candles   -> 7+2=9\n                old += total_candles    -> old=1+2=3\n                total_candles = old // b -> 3//3=1\n                old = old % b           -> 3%3=0\n\n            Then Step3: burn 1: hours=10, old=1\n                total_candles = 1//3=0, old=1\n\n            Then break.\n\n            Total hours=10.\n\n            Let me verify manually:\n\n            Start with 7 candles: burn 7 -> 7 hours, then we have 7 old.\n            Make 7//3=2 new candles, and 7%3=1 leftover.\n            Then burn the 2 new candles: 7+2=9 hours, then we have 1 (leftover) + 2 = 3 old.\n            Then from 3 old, we make 1 new candle, and 0 leftover.\n            Then burn the 1 new candle: 9+1=10 hours, then we have 1 old (from the last candle) -> cannot make more.\n\n            So 10 is correct.\n\n        But wait, in the code, we are updating old to the entire old set (from the previous old and the current burned) and then doing the modulus. \n\n        However, in the above code, we are doing:\n\n            Step1: \n                old starts at 0, then we add 7 -> old=7, then set total_candles=2, old=1.\n\n            Step2:\n                We start with old=1 (from step1) and then we burn 2 (so we add 2 to old -> old=1+2=3) and then set total_candles=1, old=0.\n\n            Step3:\n                We burn 1 -> add 1 to old -> old=1, then set total_candles=0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the variable 'old' is being updated to the remainder from the entire old set (which is the old from the previous step plus the current burned). \n\n        However, we are not storing the old from previous steps separately because we are overwriting it. \n\n        But wait, in the first iteration, we set old to 1 (from 7%3). Then in the second iteration, we start with old=1 and then we add the current burned (2) to get 3, and then set old=0 (from 3%3). \n\n        This is correct because the old from the previous step is the leftover from the previous recycling. Then we burn the current batch (which gives more old) and then we combine.\n\n        However, the code above does not explicitly combine the old from previous steps with the current burned. But note: the variable 'old' is being used to store the total old candles available (from all previous recycling and the current burning). \n\n        But wait, initially old is 0. Then we burn the initial candles and set old to the remainder of the initial burning. Then we burn the recycled candles and set old to the remainder of that batch, and so on.\n\n        This is correct because the process is: we have a pool of old candles. We use them to make new ones, and then we burn the new ones and get more old ones, and then we use the entire pool (the leftover from the last recycling plus the new old ones) to make the next batch.\n\n        The code is:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total_candles = a\n            old = 0\n            hours = 0\n\n            while total_candles > 0:\n                hours += total_candles\n                old += total_candles\n                total_candles = old // b\n                old = old % b\n\n            print(hours)\n\n        However, note: the above code updates 'old' to the entire old set (which is the old from the previous step plus the current burned) and then computes the modulus. \n\n        But wait, the modulus operation is done on the entire old set (which is the old from the previous recycling plus the current batch). \n\n        This is the correct way.\n\n        But note: we are burning the current batch and then immediately using the entire pool of old candles (which now includes the current batch's burned candles) to make new ones. \n\n        This is valid because the problem allows us to use any old candles (regardless of when they were burned) to make new ones.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: we are updating 'old' to the modulus of the entire old set (which is the old from previous recycling plus the current batch). \n\n        This is the same as: old = (old_previous + current_burned) % b, but wait, no: \n\n            We do:\n                old += total_candles   (which is the current batch)\n                then total_candles = old // b\n                then old = old % b\n\n        But note: we are using the entire old set (old_previous + current_burned) to compute the new candles and the new leftover.\n\n        This is correct because the new candles are made",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of candles and the ability to recycle burnt candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour, and after burning, it can be combined with other burnt candles to create new ones. The optimal strategy involves burning as many candles as possible at each step, including those made from recycled burnt candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (a) and the recycling threshold (b). Initialize variables to keep track of the total hours burned (hours), the current number of candles available for burning (total_candles), and the number of burnt candles saved for recycling (old).\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available candles (total_candles), adding their count to the total hours. The burnt candles are then converted into new candles based on the recycling threshold (b). Specifically, every b burnt candles can be converted into one new candle.\n3. **Recycling**: After burning the candles, update the count of new candles (total_candles) by dividing the total burnt candles (old) by b. The remainder from this division (old % b) represents the leftover burnt candles that cannot form a new candle yet.\n4. **Termination**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn (total_candles becomes zero). The total hours accumulated during the process is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_candles = a\n    old = 0\n    hours = 0\n\n    while total_candles > 0:\n        hours += total_candles\n        old += total_candles\n        total_candles = old // b\n        old = old % b\n\n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `total_candles` (initially set to `a`), `old` (initially zero), and `hours` (initially zero) are initialized to keep track of the available candles, burnt candles, and total hours, respectively.\n2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are candles left to burn (`total_candles > 0`).\n   - **Burning Phase**: The current number of candles (`total_candles`) is added to the total hours (`hours`). These candles are then considered burnt (`old += total_candles`).\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The burnt candles (`old`) are used to create new candles. The number of new candles is calculated as `old // b`, and the remaining burnt candles (`old % b`) are stored for future use.\n3. **Termination**: Once no more candles can be formed from the burnt candles (`total_candles` becomes zero), the loop exits, and the total hours burned is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling the burnt ones, ensuring the maximum number of hours is achieved by always utilizing all available candles before recycling. The complexity is logarithmic with respect to the initial number of candles, making it highly efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
