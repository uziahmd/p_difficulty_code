Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100000 items, each with weight either 1, 2, or 3, and a cost (which can be up to 10^9). We have a maximum total weight m (up to 300000).\n\n Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, we can categorize the souvenirs by their weight.\n\n Let:\n   type1 = list of costs for weight 1\n   type2 = list of costs for weight 2\n   type3 = list of costs for weight 3\n\n Then, we can sort each type in descending order (so that we can pick the most expensive ones first).\n\n Now, note that the total weight is the sum of the weights of the chosen items. We are allowed to use at most m weight.\n\n We can think of it as: we will choose some number of items from type1, type2, type3. Let:\n   x1 = number of type1 chosen (each 1)\n   x2 = number of type2 chosen (each 2)\n   x3 = number of type3 chosen (each 3)\n\n Then, the total weight is: w = x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 <= m\n And the total cost is: c = sum(type1[0:x1]) + sum(type2[0:x2]) + sum(type3[0:x3])\n\n However, iterating over all x1, x2, x3 is too expensive because n can be 100000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can use dynamic programming, but note that the total weight can be up to 300000, and we have three types.\n\n However, note the weights are small (only 1,2,3) so we can do:\n\n Step 1: Precompute prefix sums for each type.\n\n For type1: sort in descending order, then compute prefix[i] = sum of top i items (i from 0 to len(type1))\n Similarly for type2 and type3.\n\n Then, we can consider iterating over the number of type3 items (x3) and type2 items (x2), and then determine the maximum x1 we can take without exceeding m.\n\n Specifically, let:\n   base_weight = 3*x3 + 2*x2\n   remaining_weight = m - base_weight\n\n Then we need to take as many type1 as possible from the sorted list, but note: we might not want to take all the remaining_weight? Actually, we can only take up to remaining_weight type1 items, but we want the maximum cost. However, we don't necessarily take the remaining_weight if the next item isn't worth it? But wait, because our type1 is sorted in descending order, the prefix sum is increasing (non-decreasing) as we take more. So we should take as many as we can (if we take the top k, then the cost is the prefix[k]). However, we cannot take more than remaining_weight, so we take min(remaining_weight, len(type1)).\n\n But wait: there's a catch. We are allowed to choose any subset. However, because we sorted type1 in descending order, the best way to use the remaining_weight is to take the most expensive ones first until we run out of weight or items.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require taking contiguous items from the beginning? But we have sorted by descending cost, so the best items are at the front. Therefore, we can precompute the prefix sums.\n\n But here's the issue: we are iterating over x3 and x2, and then for each (x3, x2) we set x1 = min(remaining_weight, len(type1)), and then total cost = prefix1[x1] + prefix2[x2] + prefix3[x3]. But note: we might have multiple ways to assign the remaining weight to type1? Actually, no: we must use the remaining_weight entirely for type1? Not necessarily: we can also leave some weight unused. However, since the items are positive, we would want to use as much as possible (because the items are positive and we can only add, not subtract). But wait: what if an item is very expensive but we cannot take two of them? Actually, the remaining_weight is the maximum we can use for type1, so we can take up to remaining_weight, and we take the best ones.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to not use the entire remaining_weight? Then we should take the top k where k is the largest integer such that k <= remaining_weight and k <= len(type1). Then the cost is prefix1[k].\n\n But wait, what if we don't want to use all the remaining_weight because maybe a more expensive item is not available? Actually, the prefix sum array is built from the sorted (descending) list, so if we take k items, we get the highest k. And we are allowed to take any subset, so we can take the top k.\n\n However, the catch: we might have two different combinations (x3, x2) that use the same total weight, but we are covering all possibilities by iterating over x3 and x2.\n\n But note: the state space is too big: x3 can be from 0 to len(type3) (which is up to 100000), and x2 from 0 to len(type2) (also up to 100000) -> 10^10 states. We cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n Alternative idea:\n\n Since the weights are small (1,2,3), we can use a DP that iterates over the total weight and the counts of the items? But m can be up to 300000, and we have three types, but the counts are large.\n\n Another idea: we can use two of the types and then use the third to fill the gaps. But note: the problem is similar to the unbounded knapSack but with bounded items (each item is one copy). However, we have three categories.\n\n We can break down the problem by considering the total weight modulo 1 (or something) but the weights are 1,2,3.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Let dp[w] = maximum total cost achievable with total weight w (w from 0 to m). Then:\n\n   dp[0] = 0\n   Then we iterate over the items and update dp. But n is 100000 and m is 300000, which is acceptable in C++ with a 1D dp and iterating backwards, but in Python we have to be careful.\n\n However, note: each item has weight 1,2, or 3, and we have three separate lists. We can do:\n\n   dp = [0]*(m+1)\n   Then for each souvenir (each of the three types) we update the dp. But we have 100000 items, and for each item we iterate from m down to the weight, which is O(n*m) -> 100000*300000 is 30e9, which is too slow.\n\n We need a better method.\n\n Since the weights are small, we can use the fact that we have only three distinct weights. We can combine the items of the same weight and use a different DP.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Separate the items into three lists: type1, type2, type3 (for weights 1,2,3).\n 2. Sort each list in descending order.\n 3. Precompute prefix sums for each list.\n\n Then, we can iterate over the number of type3 items (x3) and then for each x3, we know the total weight used by type3 is 3*x3, and the remaining weight is m - 3*x3. Then, we need to fill the remaining weight with type1 and type2.\n\n Now, for the remaining weight, we can use:\n\n   Let R = m - 3*x3 (must be non-negative)\n\n   We can use type2 and type1. We can let y2 be the number of type2 items (from 0 to min(len(type2), R//2)), and then the remaining weight for type1 is R - 2*y2, and we take as many type1 as possible (up to the remaining weight and the available type1 items).\n\n   Then, the total cost for this (x3, y2) is:\n        cost = prefix3[x3] + prefix2[y2] + prefix1[min(len(type1), R-2*y2)]\n\n   But note: we cannot exceed the available items.\n\n However, iterating over x3 (which can be up to about 100000) and then for each x3 iterating over y2 (which can be up to 100000) is again too heavy.\n\n We need to optimize.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix the total number of type2 items and then use type1 and type3? Or use a two-layer DP for the two smaller weights.\n\n Another idea: since the weights are 1 and 2, we can consider the entire set of type1 and type2 together. Note that type2 can be thought of as two consecutive type1 items? But they are not: a type2 item has a fixed cost and weight 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Let F(w) = maximum cost achievable with total weight w using only type1 and type2.\n\n   Then, we can compute F(w) for w from 0 to m.\n\n   How to compute F(w)? We have two types: weight1 and weight2.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        F(0) = 0\n        Then, for each weight w from 1 to m:\n            F(w) = max( F(w-1) + (best type1 item if available), F(w-2) + (best type2 item if available) ) ... but we have multiple items.\n\n   But we have multiple copies? Actually, we have a multiset of type1 and type2, and we can use each at most once.\n\n   This is a bounded knapSack with two weights and two sets of items. We can combine the two sets and then use a greedy? Or we can use a two-dimensional DP? But m is 300000 and we have two types, but the numbers of items are large.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n        Let A = sorted(type1, reverse=True)   # descending\n        Let B = sorted(type2, reverse=True)    # descending\n\n        Then, we can create an array F for weights from 0 to m, but we can use the fact that we have two distinct weights.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp = [0]*(m+1)\n\n            # First, use only type1: \n            for i in range(1, len(A)+1):\n                w1 = i\n                if w1 <= m:\n                    # The cost for i type1 items is prefix1[i]\n                    # But we can mix with type2, so we don't know the order.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer method or use a deque for sliding window maximum? \n\n        Actually, we can use a different approach: consider that we are going to use k type2 items (with total weight 2*k) and then use the rest for type1. Then the remaining weight is m - 2*k, and we can use at most m - 2*k for type1, but we must also consider that the type1 items are independent.\n\n        Then, we can define:\n\n            F(w) = maximum cost for having total weight w from type1 and type2.\n\n        We can compute F(w) by:\n\n            Let G(w) = maximum cost for weight w using only type1.\n            Then, for each type2 item (or for each k from 0 to min(len(B), w//2)):\n                F(w) = max_{k=0}^{min(len(B), w//2)} { prefixB[k] + G(w - 2*k) }\n\n        But then we need to compute G(w) for all w from 0 to m, and then combine with the type2.\n\n        How to compute G(w) for all w from 0 to m?\n\n            G(w) is the maximum sum of type1 items that we can get with weight <= w.\n\n            Since type1 items are weight 1, we can use as many as w, but we have a limited set. We have the sorted list A (descending) and we have the prefix sum for type1.\n\n            Then, G(w) = prefix1[min(len(A), w)]\n\n            But wait, that is for exactly w items? Actually, we can take at most w items (since each is weight1). And we want the maximum cost for at most w items. Since we sorted in descending order, the best w items (if we have at least w items) is prefix1[w]. If we have less than w items, then we take all.\n\n        So, we can set:\n\n            Let L1 = len(type1)\n            For w from 0 to m:\n                num1 = min(L1, w)\n                G[w] = prefix1[num1]\n\n        Then, for type2, we have:\n\n            Let L2 = len(type2)\n            Then for a given k (number of type2 items, 0<=k<=L2) we use 2*k weight and get prefixB[k] (the top k type2 items).\n\n            Then, for a total weight w, we can use k type2 items (with k from 0 to min(L2, w//2)) and then the remaining weight is w - 2*k, which we use for type1: G(w-2*k) = prefix1[min(L1, w-2*k)]\n\n            Then, F(w) = max_{k=0}^{min(L2, w//2)} { prefixB[k] + prefix1[min(L1, w-2*k)] }\n\n        But note: we must consider that the same souvenir cannot be used twice, and we are combining the two sets. However, we have already separated the two sets, so we are not mixing the same souvenir. But wait: we have two independent sets. However, we are allowed to use at most the entire set of type1 and type2.\n\n        Then, we can precompute:\n\n            Step 1: Compute prefix1 for type1 (for 0 to L1) and similarly prefix2 for type2 (for 0 to L2).\n\n            Step 2: Precompute G(w) for w from 0 to m: \n                Let G = [0]*(m+1)\n                For w from 0 to m:\n                    k1 = min(L1, w)   # number of type1 items we can take (each weight1, so we can take up to w items, but we have only L1)\n                    G[w] = prefix1[k1]   # but wait, what if w is 0? then k1=0, which is okay.\n\n            Step 3: Precompute F(w) for w from 0 to m:\n\n                We can iterate w from 0 to m, and for each w, we try all k from 0 to min(L2, w//2) and then:\n\n                    candidate = prefix2[k] + G[w - 2*k]\n\n                Then F(w) = max(candidate for all k) \n\n                However, this is O(m * L2) which is 300000 * (number of type2 items) which can be 100000 -> 300000*100000 is 30e9, too slow.\n\n        We need to optimize the combination.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach for F(w):\n\n            We consider that we are going to use k type2 items (k from 0 to L2) and then the remaining weight is w' = w - 2*k, and we use G(w') for type1.\n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n                Let F(w) = max_{k=0}^{min(L2, w//2)} { prefix2[k] + G(w - 2*k) }\n\n            But note: the term G(w-2*k) is just the prefix1 for the number of type1 items we can use in the remaining weight (w-2*k). However, we can precompute an array for G for all w, and then for each k, we know that the remaining weight is w-2*k, so we look up G[w-2*k].\n\n            But the challenge is to do it fast for all w from 0 to m.\n\n        Another idea: instead of iterating w from 0 to m and then k from 0 to min(L2, w//2), we can iterate k from 0 to L2 and update a range of w.\n\n            For each k (number of type2 items), we have a fixed cost = prefix2[k], and then we can use the remaining weight w' = w - 2*k, and the type1 part is G(w'). So the total for a given w is: prefix2[k] + G(w-2*k).\n\n            Then, for a fixed k, we can update for w from 2*k to m:\n\n                candidate[w] = prefix2[k] + G(w-2*k)\n\n            Then F(w) = max_{k} candidate[w]\n\n            But note: we are updating for each k and for each w from 2*k to m, so the total operations is about sum_{k=0}^{L2} (m - 2*k + 1). The worst-case when L2 is 100000 and m is 300000, then the inner loop runs (m-2*k+1) times for each k, so total iterations is about (m+1)*(L2+1) / 2? Actually, the total number of updates is roughly (m+1) * (L2+1) which is 300000 * 100000 = 30e9, too slow.\n\n        We need a smarter way.\n\n        Let me reframe: We have two arrays:\n\n            Let A[w] = G(w) for w from 0 to m. (This is the best type1 we can get for weight w)\n\n            Then, we want to compute for each w: \n\n                F(w) = max_{k: 2*k <= w, k<=L2} { prefix2[k] + A[w-2*k] }\n\n        We can iterate k from 0 to L2, and then for each k, we are effectively shifting the array A by 2*k and adding a constant (prefix2[k]), then taking the maximum over k.\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            Let H_k(w) = prefix2[k] + A[w-2*k] for w>=2*k.\n\n            Then F(w) = max_{k} H_k(w)\n\n        How to compute F(w) for all w quickly?\n\n        We can use a sliding window maximum for each fixed k? But the shift is by 2*k, and the array A is fixed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a deque to compute the maximum over a sliding window for a fixed shift? But note: the shifts are multiples of 2, and the window for a fixed k is from w=2*k to w=m.\n\n        But note: the function H_k(w) is defined only for w>=2*k, and for each k we are shifting the array A by 2*k and adding a constant.\n\n        Then, we can consider:\n\n            Let B_k = [A[0], A[1], ..., A[m]] but then we take a subarray starting at index k (if we consider w as index) and shift by 2*k? Actually, we are indexing by w, and we use A[w-2*k]. So for a fixed k, we are looking at the array A from index 0 to m, but we skip the first 2*k indices? Actually, we start at index 0 and then the value at w is taken from A[w-2*k] which is the same as shifting the array A to the right by 2*k and then the value at w is A[w-2*k]. But actually, we can precompute for each k the array shifted_A_k = [ -inf, -inf, ..., A[0], A[1], ... ] (with 2*k leading -infs) and then add prefix2[k] to every element.\n\n        Then F(w) is the maximum over k of the shifted array for k at position w.\n\n        But note: the shifts are multiples of 2, so we are effectively considering even shifts.\n\n        However, note that we can also consider: for a fixed w, we only consider k such that 2*k <= w, and then we look at A[w-2*k]. We can iterate k from 0 to floor(w/2) and take the maximum of prefix2[k] + A[w-2*k]. But then we have to do that for each w, and the total work is the sum_{w=0}^{m} (floor(w/2)+1) which is O(m^2) and is too slow.\n\n        Another idea: use a deque to maintain the best candidate for the type2 part for a given remainder modulo 2? Actually, note that the total weight w can be broken into:\n\n            w = 2*k + r, where r is the weight used by type1 (which must be between 0 and min(w, L1) but actually we don't care about r, we just use A[r] for the type1 part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different DP that considers the entire set of items (type1 and type2) and uses the fact that the weights are 1 and 2. We can do:\n\n            Let dp[i][j] = maximum cost for using i type2 items and j type1 items, but that doesn't help.\n\n        Another known trick for bounded knapSack with small weights is to use multiple copies of the small weight items. But note, we have two distinct weights and the items are distinct.\n\n        We can use a greedy and two pointers? \n\n        Let me change the perspective: we have two types: type1 (weight1) and type2 (weight2). We want to maximize the total cost with total weight <= w.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            Sort type1 in descending order, and type2 in descending order.\n\n            Then, we can consider: we are going to use k type2 items, then we must use at most w - 2*k type1 items. The best k type2 items give a cost of prefix2[k], and the best (w-2*k) type1 items (if available) give a cost of prefix1[min(L1, w-2*k)].\n\n            Then, we can iterate k from 0 to min(L2, w//2) and take the maximum.\n\n        But then we have to do that for every w from 0 to m, which is too slow.\n\n        Instead, we can precompute an array F for all w from 0 to m by:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute G(w) for all w (as described above).\n\n            Step 2: Precompute an array H for all w from 0 to m:\n\n                Let H[w] = max_{k=0}^{min(L2, w//2)} { prefix2[k] + G(w-2*k) }\n\n            How to compute H[w] fast?\n\n            Notice that for a fixed w, we are looking at k from 0 to floor(w/2). We can write:\n\n                Let T = floor(w/2)\n\n                Then, H[w] = max_{k=0}^{T} { prefix2[k] + G(w-2*k) }\n\n            Now, note that w-2*k runs from w (when k=0) down to w-2*T (when k=T). The values of G are stored in an array.\n\n            We can also observe that w-2*k is decreasing as k increases.\n\n            We can try to iterate k from 0 to T, but T can be up to 150000 (if w=300000) and then total operations is the sum_{w=0}^{m} (floor(w/2)+1) ~ (m*(m+2))/4 which is about (300000)^2/4 = 22.5e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n        We need a different method.\n\n        Let me try to reverse the iteration: iterate by k (number of type2 items) and update the entire array H.\n\n        For a fixed k, we have:\n\n            For w from 2*k to m:\n                candidate = prefix2[k] + G[w-2*k]\n\n            Then, we want to update H[w] = max(H[w], candidate)\n\n        Then, we do this for k from 0 to L2.\n\n        But the total number of updates is the same as before: for each k, we update (m-2*k+1) positions. The total updates is about (m+1)*(L2+1)/2, which is too many.\n\n        However, note that we can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree to update ranges? Or we can use a different idea: for each k, we are updating an arithmetic progression (every other weight) with a constant shift.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a two-layer dynamic programming that goes by the weight and uses the type2 items in a smarter way.\n\n        We can use the following: the type2 items can be replaced by two type1 items of half the cost? Not exactly, but we can use the concept of \"virtual\" type1 items. However, the costs are arbitrary.\n\n        Another idea: use a state machine that considers the remainder modulo 2.\n\n        Since the weights are 1 and 2, we can consider:\n\n            Let dp_even[w] = maximum cost for weight w using type1 and type2, where w is even.\n            Let dp_odd[w] = maximum cost for weight w using type1 and type2, where w is odd.\n\n        Then, we can update:\n\n            dp_even[0] = 0\n            dp_odd[0] = -infinity (or 0? but then we cannot use odd weight)\n\n            Then, for each type1 item (cost c, weight1): \n                for w from m down to 0:\n                    if we add a type1: then from even w: becomes odd w+1, and from odd w: becomes even w+1? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                dp0[w] = maximum cost for weight w (even)\n                dp1[w] = maximum cost for weight w (odd)\n\n            Then, we can update:\n\n                dp0[w] = max(dp0[w], dp1[w-1] + c)   # if we add a type1 to an odd state to get even\n                dp1[w] = max(dp1[w], dp0[w-1] + c)   # if we add a type1 to an even state to get odd\n\n                Also, for type2 (weight2, cost d):\n                    dp0[w] = max(dp0[w], dp0[w-2] + d)\n                    dp1[w] = max(dp1[w], dp1[w-2] + d)\n\n            But then we are iterating over each item. However, we have multiple items of the same type.\n\n        But note: we have separate lists for type1 and type2. We can combine all type1 items and all type2 items.\n\n        However, we have up to 100000 items, and we cannot iterate over each item and then iterate w from 0 to m (which is 300000) because that would be 100000 * 300000 = 30e9.\n\n        But we can use the following: since the type1 and type2 items are given, we can sort them and then use a greedy knapSack update with a deque for each weight? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: the type1 items are weight1, so we can use unlimited supply of virtual type1 items? But no, we have a fixed set.\n\n        Known efficient method for bounded knapSack with small weights is to split the items into groups by weight and then use a technique called \"meet in the middle\" or \"grouping\", but here the weight is only 1 and 2.\n\n        There is a well-known method for small weights: use a deque to compute the maximum value for a given weight modulo the small weight.\n\n        Specifically, for weight1 items, we can use a deque to compute the best cost for a given number of type1 items (but we already have the prefix sum).\n\n        For type2 items, we can do similarly.\n\n        However, I recall a method for coin change with coins of denominations 1 and 2, but with fixed set of coins.\n\n        After thinking, perhaps we can use a two-dimensional state: weight modulo 2, and then within each residue, we use a deque to keep track of the best cost for a given remainder and a given weight.\n\n        Steps for type1 and type2 combined:\n\n            We'll maintain two deques: one for even weight and one for odd weight.\n\n            But note: we have two types of items: type1 (weight1) and type2 (weight2).\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a two-dimensional array: dp[2][w] for w from 0 to m, but that is 2*(m+1) states, and m=300000, so 600000 states, but then we need to update with items.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                dp[0][w] = maximum cost for weight w (even) using type1 and type2\n                dp[1][w] = maximum cost for weight w (odd) using type1 and type2\n\n            But then we iterate over items and update the dp. The total number of states is 2*(m+1) = 600001, and then we iterate over 100000 items, and for each item we update from w=m downto the weight. That is 100000*300000 which is 30e9, too slow.\n\n        Another known method for small weights is to use a \"sliding window\" for each residue class.\n\n        Let's consider the following: we want to compute the best cost for a given weight w. We can consider that we will use some number of type2 items (each weight2) and then the rest type1.\n\n        Then, the total weight w = 2*a + b, where b is the number of type1 items (which is the same as the weight from type1). But note: we have a fixed set of type1 and type2.\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            Let X = sorted(type1, reverse=True)\n            Let Y = sorted(type2, reverse=True)\n\n            Then, we can consider that we are going to use a type2 items and then use the best b type1 items, with b = w - 2*a, and a from 0 to floor(w/2).\n\n            Then, the cost = prefix2[a] + prefix1[min(len(X), w-2*a)]\n\n            Then, for each w, we need to find the maximum cost over a in [0, floor(w/2)].\n\n            But then, we can let a vary, and notice that w-2*a is linear in a.\n\n        We can also consider: let a = floor((w - t)/2) for t in [0,1] (remainder) but that doesn't help.\n\n        Let me try to fix the number of type2 items. For each a, we have:\n\n            cost(a) = prefix2[a] + prefix1[min(len(X), w-2*a)]\n\n            And we want to maximize cost(a) for a in [0, min(len(Y), floor(w/2))].\n\n        Now, we can precompute an array for type1: let F1(w) = prefix1[min(len(X), w)].\n\n        Then, for a fixed w, we want to compute:\n\n            ans = max_{a=0}^{min(len(Y), floor(w/2))} { prefix2[a] + F1(w-2*a) }\n\n        Now, we can iterate a from 0 to floor(w/2), but that is too slow.\n\n        But note: we are going to do this for every w from 0 to m. Total operations ~ O(m^2) which is 300000^2 = 90e9, too slow.\n\n        We need to optimize the query for each w.\n\n        Observation: The function in a is not necessarily convex or concave, so we cannot use ternary search.\n\n        Another idea: iterate a from 0 to len(Y), and then for each a, the values of w that are affected are from 2*a to m, and the contribution is prefix2[a] + F1(w-2*a). Then, for each a, we are essentially saying: for every w >= 2*a, the candidate for a is prefix2[a] + F1(w-2*a).\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            Let H = [-10**18]*(m+1)   # we'll store the best candidate for each w\n\n            For a from 0 to len(Y):\n                Let c = prefix2[a]\n                Let base = c\n                Let arr = [ base + F1(w-2*a) for w from 2*a to m ]\n\n                But then we want to update H[w] = max(H[w], base + F1(w-2*a))\n\n            Then, after processing all a, F(w) = max_{a} { base + F1(w-2*a) } = H[w]\n\n        But the direct construction of arr is too slow.\n\n        We can update with a difference array or a segment tree? Or we can use a deque to do a sliding window maximum? \n\n        Let me consider: for a fixed a, the function f_a(w) = base + F1(w-2*a) is defined for w>=2*a. And F1 is a non-decreasing function in its argument (because we are taking the best items, so as we increase the number of type1 items, the cost never decreases). But note: F1(x) = prefix1[min(len(X),x)] and x=w-2*a, and as w increases, x increases, and F1(x) is non-decreasing.\n\n        Then, the function f_a(w) is non-decreasing in w.\n\n        Now, for a fixed w, we want the maximum over a of f_a(w). \n\n        But note: for a given w, a can only go from 0 to floor(w/2). And we want the maximum of f_a(w) = prefix2[a] + F1(w-2*a).\n\n        We can try to iterate a from 0 to floor(w/2) for each w, but that is O(m^2).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: consider that we want to compute an array ans[w] = max_{a=0}^{floor(w/2)} { prefix2[a] + F1(w-2*a) }.\n\n        Let me change the variable: let t = w - 2*a, then a = (w-t)//2, and t must be even or odd depending on w and a. Actually, t = w - 2*a, so t has the same parity as w.\n\n        Then, we can write: ans[w] = max_{t = w, w-2, w-4, ..., 0} { prefix2[(w-t)//2] + F1(t) }\n\n        But then, we are taking t from 0 to w, with step 2.\n\n        Then, we can use dynamic programming with a sliding window:\n\n            Let dp[w] = max( F1(w), max_{t=0}^{w-2} { dp[t+2] } )   ??? Not exactly.\n\n        But note: we also have the type2 items. Actually, we can incorporate the type2 items by noting that using a type2 item reduces the weight by 2 and adds its cost, but we are already accounting for type2 by the a index.\n\n        Given the time constraints, I decide to use the following:\n\n            Since the weight m is up to 300000 and the number of type2 items is at most 100000, we can iterate over the number of type2 items a from 0 to min(len(Y), m//2), and then for each a, we update a range of w: from 2*a to m.\n\n            But we cannot iterate over every w for each a.\n\n        Another idea: use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree to range update and point query? But we are doing many updates and then we want the maximum at each w.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let res = [-10**18]*(m+1)\n\n            For a in range(0, len(Y)+1):\n                Let w_start = 2*a\n                Let w_end = m\n                Let val = prefix2[a] + F1(w_start)   # at w_start, the type1 part is F1(w_start - 2*a) = F1(0) = 0? No, wait: w_start - 2*a = 0, so F1(0)=0? Actually, F1(w) is defined for w>=0: F1(0) = prefix1[0] = 0 (if we take 0 type1 items).\n\n                But then as w increases, the type1 part F1(w-2*a) = prefix1[min(len(X), w-2*a)].\n\n                So the candidate function for fixed a is: candidate(w) = prefix2[a] + (prefix1[min(len(X), w-2*a)])\n\n                We want to update res[w] = max(res[w], candidate(w))\n\n            Then, after processing all a, F(w) = res[w]",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs have weights of either 1, 2, or 3, and each has a specific cost. The challenge is to select a subset of these souvenirs such that their total weight is within the limit and their total cost is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three lists based on their weights (1, 2, or 3). Each list will contain the costs of souvenirs with the corresponding weight.\n2. **Sort and Prefix Sums**: For each list, sort the costs in descending order and compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly access the sum of the top k items in each category.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Combined Weights**: Use dynamic programming to handle the combination of souvenirs from different weight categories. Specifically, we consider the use of weight 1 and weight 2 souvenirs together, leveraging their properties to efficiently compute the maximum cost for any given remaining weight after using weight 3 souvenirs.\n4. **Maximize Total Cost**: Iterate over possible counts of weight 3 souvenirs, then for each count, determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and weight 2 souvenirs that fits the remaining weight without exceeding it, using the precomputed prefix sums and dynamic programming results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    type1 = []\n    type2 = []\n    type3 = []\n    \n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        w = int(data[index]); c = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            type1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            type2.append(c)\n        elif w == 3:\n            type3.append(c)\n            \n    type1.sort(reverse=True)\n    type2.sort(reverse=True)\n    type3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    L1 = len(type1)\n    L2 = len(type2)\n    L3 = len(type3)\n    \n    prefix1 = [0]*(L1+1)\n    for i in range(1, L1+1):\n        prefix1[i] = prefix1[i-1] + type1[i-1]\n        \n    prefix2 = [0]*(L2+1)\n    for i in range(1, L2+1):\n        prefix2[i] = prefix2[i-1] + type2[i-1]\n        \n    prefix3 = [0]*(L3+1)\n    for i in range(1, L3+1):\n        prefix3[i] = prefix3[i-1] + type3[i-1]\n        \n    G = [0]*(m+1)\n    for w in range(0, m+1):\n        num = min(L1, w)\n        G[w] = prefix1[num]\n        \n    F_arr = [-10**18]*(m+1)\n    F_arr[0] = 0\n    \n    dp_even = [-10**18]*(m+1)\n    dp_odd = [-10**18]*(m+1)\n    dp_even[0] = 0\n    dp_odd[0] = -10**18\n    \n    for w in range(1, m+1):\n        candidates = []\n        if w >= 1 and dp_even[w-1] != -10**18:\n            candidates.append(dp_even[w-1] + (type1[-1] if L1>0 else 0))\n        if w >= 2 and dp_odd[w-2] != -10**18:\n            candidates.append(dp_odd[w-2] + (type2[-1] if L2>0 else 0))\n        if w >= 3 and dp_even[w-3] != -10**18:\n            candidates.append(dp_even[w-3] + (type3[-1] if L3>0 else 0))\n        if candidates:\n            dp_even[w] = max(candidates) if w % 2 == 0 else -10**18\n            dp_odd[w] = max(candidates) if w % 2 == 1 else -10**18\n        else:\n            dp_even[w] = -10**18\n            dp_odd[w] = -10**18\n            \n    best = 0\n    for x3 in range(0, L3+1):\n        weight3 = 3*x3\n        if weight3 > m:\n            break\n        cost3 = prefix3[x3]\n        remaining = m - weight3\n        if remaining < 0:\n            continue\n            \n        if remaining == 0:\n            total_cost = cost3\n            if total_cost > best:\n                best = total_cost\n            continue\n            \n        if remaining % 2 == 0:\n            candidate = cost3 + dp_even[remaining]\n        else:\n            candidate = cost3 + dp_odd[remaining]\n            \n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing and Categorization**: The input is read and parsed into three lists based on the weight of each souvenir (1, 2, or 3).\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each list is sorted in descending order of cost, and prefix sums are computed to facilitate quick summation of the top k items.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two arrays, `dp_even` and `dp_odd`, are initialized to store the maximum cost achievable for even and odd total weights, respectively.\n4. **DP Array Population**: The DP arrays are populated by considering the inclusion of one or two souvenirs at a time, updating the maximum cost for each possible weight.\n5. **Combining Results**: For each possible number of weight 3 souvenirs, the remaining weight is calculated, and the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 souvenirs is found using the precomputed DP arrays.
