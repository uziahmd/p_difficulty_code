    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a simpler method.\n However, note: we need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and these occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We cannot use the same substring twice in overlapping? But the problem says they can overlap.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"ababa\" -> Output 3 because \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2 (overlapping).\n\n Approach:\n We are to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try from the maximum possible length (which is n//2, but actually we might have even longer if overlapping) down to 1.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, even with overlap. So the maximum length we can consider is floor(n/2) for non-overlapping? Actually, no: because with overlapping, we can have a substring of length L appearing twice even when the two occurrences are separated by some characters.\n\n But note: the entire string is length n. The two occurrences must start at different indices. The condition for two occurrences to overlap is that the distance between the two starting indices is less than L. For example, in \"ababa\", \"aba\" starts at index0 and index2, and 2-0 = 2 < 3 (the length). \n\n How to check for a fixed length L?\n   We can collect all distinct substrings of length L and check if any substring appears at least twice.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have more than two, but at least two.\n\n However, the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two or more.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can do:\n\n   Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n\n   We can iterate L from min(n, ...) down to 1, but what is the maximum L? It can be up to floor((n+1)/2) ? Actually, no: because two occurrences of a substring of length L must start at two indices i and j such that |i - j| < L (if they overlap) or |i-j|>=L (if not). But the entire string is of length n, so the last occurrence of a substring of length L can start at index n-L.\n\n   Actually, the maximum L for which a substring can appear twice is such that we can have two starting indices i and j (with i < j) and j-i < L (if overlapping) OR j-i >= L (non-overlapping). But note: the two occurrences must fit in the string, so j must be <= n-L. Then the condition for non-overlapping is j >= i+L. So we require i+L <= n-L, i.e., i <= n-2*L. But wait, if we allow overlapping then we don't require non-overlapping. Actually, the two occurrences can be anywhere as long as they are distinct (same substring) and the substring is contiguous.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the maximum length L for which a substring can appear twice is at most floor(n/2) if we require non-overlapping? But the problem allows overlapping. For example, in \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears three times. The length of the string is 3, and the substring \"aa\" has length 2. The two occurrences can be at index0 and index1, and they overlap.\n\n   Actually, the maximum length L must satisfy: there exist two starting indices i and j (i<j) such that the substring of length L starting at i equals the substring of length L starting at j, and the two occurrences must be within the string (so j+L <= n). Also, note that the two occurrences can be consecutive? Yes.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. So the maximum L we can get is limited by the fact that the two occurrences must start at two different indices and the entire substring must be contained. The maximum L we can have is floor(n/2) only if we require non-overlapping? Actually, no: in the example \"ababa\", n=5, and we found L=3. 3 is greater than floor(5/2)=2. So the maximum L can be larger than floor(n/2). In fact, the maximum L can be as large as the length of the entire string minus one? Not exactly: because we need two occurrences. The two occurrences must be contained in the string. The first occurrence starts at index i and the second at index j (with j>i). The condition is that j + L <= n. The smallest gap between the two occurrences is 0 (if they overlap). So the maximum L is such that there are two indices i and j (with j-i < L) and j+L <= n.\n\n   Actually, we can have two occurrences that are adjacent? Then j = i+1, and the condition is i+1+L <= n -> i <= n - L - 1.\n\n   How about: the maximum L is at most n-1 (because if L=n, then the substring is the whole string, and we need two occurrences. But the whole string can only appear once unless the string is periodic? Actually, if the string is \"aaa\", then n=3, and the whole string \"aaa\" appears only once. But we can have two occurrences of a substring of length 2? yes, as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"substring\", and by definition a substring is contiguous. And the two occurrences can be overlapping. So the maximum L we can get is the maximum integer L such that there exists an integer i (starting index) and j (starting index) with j>=i+1 and j+L<=n, and s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. \n\n   We can also consider that the two occurrences don't necessarily have to be consecutive. \n\n   We can iterate L from floor(n/2) down to 1? Actually, we should iterate from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) down to 1, and the first L for which we find at least one substring that appears at least twice is the answer.\n\n   But note: it's possible that a shorter substring appears twice, but we want the longest.\n\n   Since n is at most 100, we can iterate L from 99 down to 1 (since n<=100, then L_max=99) and check for each L if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, we can optimize: the maximum L for which a substring can appear twice is at most floor(n/2) if we require non-overlapping? But with overlapping, we can have L as large as n-1? Let's check:\n\n      Consider a string of all the same character, say 'a' * 100. Then for L=99, we can have two occurrences: \n          Occurrence 1: from index0 to index98\n          Occurrence 2: from index1 to index99\n          They are overlapping and the substring is the same.\n\n      But wait, the condition for two occurrences is that they are the same substring. In the case of all 'a's, every substring of length L is the same. So we can have multiple occurrences.\n\n      So the maximum L we need to check is from min(n, ...) down to 1? Actually, we can set the maximum L to n-1 (because if we take L=n, then the substring is the entire string, and we can only have one occurrence). So we check L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n   However, note: if we have a string of length n, the maximum L for which we can have two occurrences is n-1. But is that always true? Only if the entire string is the same? Otherwise, maybe not. But the condition is: we need two occurrences. For L = n-1, the two occurrences would require two substrings of length n-1. The first one is from index0 to index n-2, and the second one from index1 to index n-1. These two must be equal. \n\n   Example: \"abc\" (n=3). Then for L=2, we have two substrings of length 2: \n        s0: \"ab\"\n        s1: \"bc\"\n        They are not equal. So the maximum L in \"abc\" is 1.\n\n   But in \"aaa\", for L=2: \n        s0: \"aa\", s1: \"aa\", so L=2 is valid.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # Create a dictionary to record the substrings and their starting indices (or just count)\n            seen = {}\n            # Alternatively, we can use a set to record the substrings, but we need to know if we've seen the same substring twice.\n            # But note: we can break early if we find one substring that appears twice.\n\n            # We'll traverse all starting indices i from 0 to n-L\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                # If we've seen this substring before, then we have at least two occurrences.\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # But we need to make sure that the current occurrence is distinct from the previous ones? \n                    # Actually, we are just counting, so we can break as soon as we see a duplicate.\n                    print(L)   # This is the answer, but we are iterating from large to small, so we output and break out of both loops.\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n\n            if found:\n                break\n\n        If we don't break, then we didn't find any L from n-1 down to 1, then the answer is 0.\n\n   But wait: what if we find a substring of length L that appears twice, but we are using a dictionary that records the substring. However, note that the same substring can appear multiple times, but we only need to see if we've seen it once already.\n\n   However, there's a catch: if we have three occurrences, then the first time we see the substring we store it, the second time we see it we break. But what if the two occurrences are not consecutive? Our dictionary stores every substring we've seen. But note: we are traversing the string from left to right. The dictionary doesn't care about the order.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence. That is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above method does not account for the fact that the two occurrences must be distinct (but they are by starting index). The dictionary is storing the substring itself, and we break as soon as we see a duplicate substring.\n\n   But is that correct? Yes, because if we see the same substring again, then we have at least two occurrences.\n\n   However, let's test with \"ababa\":\n\n        n=5, we try L=4: \n            substrings: \n                \"abab\" (from index0) -> new\n                \"baba\" (from index1) -> new\n            no duplicate.\n\n        L=3:\n            substrings: \n                \"aba\" (index0) -> new\n                \"bab\" (index1) -> new\n                \"aba\" (index2) -> duplicate! -> break and output 3.\n\n   That matches.\n\n   Another test: \"abcabc\"\n\n        n=6, we try L=5: \n            \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=4:\n            \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3:\n            \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> duplicate at the last one -> output 3.\n\n   But wait, in \"abcabc\", the substring \"abc\" appears twice (at index0 and index3) and also \"abc\" appears again at index3. However, our method for L=3:\n        i=0: \"abc\" -> new\n        i=1: \"bca\" -> new\n        i=2: \"cab\" -> new\n        i=3: \"abc\" -> duplicate -> break.\n\n   So that works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the two occurrences can overlap. In the above, the two occurrences of \"abc\" in \"abcabc\" are non-overlapping (because they are separated by one character). But our method also handles overlapping because we are checking every substring. For example, in \"ababa\", the two \"aba\" are overlapping.\n\n   But wait: the above method for L=3 in \"ababa\" uses the substring at index0 and index2. When i=2, we check the substring and it is the same as the one at index0.\n\n   However, note that the dictionary doesn't record the starting index, only the substring. So we break as soon as we see a duplicate.\n\n   But there's a potential issue: what if the same substring appears three or more times? Then we break at the second occurrence, which is correct because we are looking for at least two.\n\n   One more edge: if the string is empty? The problem says non-empty.\n\n   But what if the string has length 1? Then n=1, we iterate L from 0 down to 1? Actually, our loop goes from n-1 (which is 0) down to 1? Then we do nothing. Then we output 0.\n\n   That is correct because in a string of length 1, there's no substring of positive length that appears twice.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but we must consider the case of length 1.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the string length doesn't exceed 100 and is non-empty.\n\n   But our loop for L in range(n-1, 0, -1) will not run if n==1 because n-1=0, and then we go from 0 to 1 (exclusive) in reverse? Actually, the range function in Python for range(start, stop, step) goes from start down to stop+1 (if step is negative) but wait, no: the step is positive in our case? Actually, we are doing:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n   This means we start at n-1 and go down to 1 (inclusive). But if n==1, then n-1=0, and we start at 0 and go down to 1, which is an empty range (because 0 is less than 1 and we are stepping by -1, so it will not enter). Then we break out without finding anything, so we output 0.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   But wait, we did not set a default output. We break out of the outer loop and then we need to output 0.\n\n   We can restructure the code:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = True   # or just use set, but we break as soon as we see a duplicate\n\n            if found:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   However, we must initialize ans to 0 because if we don't find any, then we output 0.\n\n   But wait, what if there are multiple substrings of the same length L that appear twice? We break at the first L (largest) we find, so that's the answer.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) downward, so we find the maximum L.\n\n   However, let's consider performance: the worst-case scenario is when the string is all the same letter. Then the number of distinct substrings of length L is 1 (for each L). Then for each L, we are going to have n-L+1 substrings, all the same. Then we will see the first substring (store it) and then the next one is a duplicate (at i=1). So we break at the second occurrence for each L.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from large L to small. So the first L we break on is the largest L for which there is a duplicate.\n\n   However, the total work is:\n\n        For L = n-1: we check until we find the duplicate at the second occurrence (if any). The second occurrence of the same substring (which is the entire string except one character) would be at index1. But wait, the substring of length n-1 starting at index0 and index1 are different? \n\n        Example: \"aaaa\": \n            n=4, L=3: \n                substrings: \n                    index0: \"aaa\"\n                    index1: \"aaa\" -> duplicate -> break. So we break at L=3.\n\n        So the answer for \"aaaa\" is 3.\n\n        But wait: the substring \"aaa\" appears at index0 and index1. The two occurrences are overlapping? Actually, they are adjacent and overlapping by 2 characters. So that's allowed.\n\n   However, note that the entire string is \"aaaa\". The substring \"aaa\" is taken from index0 to index2 and from index1 to index3. They are distinct occurrences.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        Read the string s.\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break out of both loops\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = True\n            else: \n                continue   # only if the inner loop did not break\n            break         # if the inner loop broke, then break the outer\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   But we can write it more cleanly:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # We are going to check for duplicates in the set of substrings of length L.\n            # But we can use a set and break early if we find a duplicate.\n            found_duplicate = False\n            seen_set = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen_set:\n                    found_duplicate = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen_set.add(substr)\n            if found_duplicate:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   This is equivalent.\n\n   But note: the worst-case scenario is when there are no duplicates until a very small L. Then we iterate over all L from n-1 down to 1, and for each L we iterate over all starting positions. The total operations would be:\n\n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1)\n\n        = (n) + (n-1) + ... + (1) = n*(n+1)/2\n\n   Since n<=100, the maximum operations is about 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can break early for each L as soon as we find a duplicate, so in many cases we won't do the full iteration.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   There is one more optimization: we can use a set and break as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string length is at most 100, so even if we do the full set for each L until we break, the worst-case (like a random string with no repeated substring) we do about 5050 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also consider: if we are looking for the longest substring that repeats, we can use a different approach: consider the suffix array or use dynamic programming for common substring, but given the constraints, the above is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\n        'abcd' -> output 0.\n        'ababa' -> output 3.\n        'zzz' -> output 2.\n\n   Let me check 'zzz':\n\n        n=3, we iterate L from 2 down to 1.\n\n        L=2: \n            substrings: \n                \"zz\" at index0 -> add to set\n                \"zz\" at index1 -> found duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another example: \"abcd\" (n=4): \n        L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: substrings: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1: substrings: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        # If the string is empty, but problem says non-empty, so we assume at least one char.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(ans)\n\n   Let me test with \"aaa\" (n=3):\n\n        L=2: \n            i=0: substr=\"aa\" -> not in seen -> add\n            i=1: substr=\"aa\" -> found -> break and output 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But wait, in the example \"abcabc\", we found 3. But note: the substring \"abc\" appears twice, but also \"abc\" appears at index0 and index3. However, our method for L=3 breaks at the second occurrence of \"abc\", which is at index3.\n\n   However, note that the two occurrences must be distinct. The substring \"abc\" at index0 and index3 are distinct and the problem allows them.\n\n   But wait, what if the two occurrences are not distinct? Actually, the substring is defined by its content, so two different starting indices with the same content are two distinct occurrences.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, one more example: \"aabaa\" (n=5). What is the answer?\n\n        We are looking for the longest substring that appears twice.\n\n        Possibilities:\n          L=4: \n            substrings: \"aaba\", \"abaa\" -> no duplicate.\n          L=3:\n            substrings: \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\", \"aab\" -> wait, the last one is \"aab\", which was seen at the first one. So duplicate -> output 3.\n\n        But wait, the substring \"aab\" appears at index0 and index3. The two occurrences are non-overlapping? \n            index0: [0:3] -> \"aab\"\n            index3: [3:6] -> but wait, n=5, so index3: s[3:3+3] = s[3:6] -> but 3+3=6 is beyond the string? Actually, no: because the substring of length 3 starting at index3 would be s[3:6] but the string only has 5 characters. So we must ensure that i+L <= n. \n\n        Correction: in the inner loop, i goes from 0 to n-L (inclusive). For n=5 and L=3, i goes from 0 to 2 (because 5-3+1 = 3, so i in [0,1,2]). \n\n        So the substring at index3 is not considered for L=3 because 3+3=6>5. \n\n        Then how did I get the substring \"aab\" at index3? \n\n        Actually, the substring at index3 for L=3 is s[3:6] which is out of bounds. \n\n        So I made a mistake: the substring at index0: \"aab\", index1: \"aba\", index2: \"baa\". \n\n        Now, is there a duplicate? \n            \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\" -> no duplicates.\n\n        Then we move to L=2:\n            substrings: \n                i0: \"aa\"\n                i1: \"ab\"\n                i2: \"ba\"\n                i3: \"aa\" -> duplicate with \"aa\" at i0 -> output 2.\n\n        But wait, the substring \"aa\" appears at index0 and index3 (if we consider the entire string \"aabaa\", then the substring at index3 is \"aa\" (from index3 to index4)). \n\n        So the answer for \"aabaa\" should be 2? \n\n        However, wait: is there a longer substring? \n\n        Let me check for L=3 again: \n            The substrings are \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\". None repeated.\n\n        But wait, what about L=4? \n            substrings: \n                i0: \"aaba\"\n                i1: \"abaa\"\n            no duplicate.\n\n        And L=5: not considered because we start from n-1=4.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the two occurrences can overlap. In \"aabaa\", we have two occurrences of \"aa\": \n            first at index0 (characters 0 and 1) and second at index3 (characters 3 and 4). They are not overlapping? Actually, they are separated by two characters. \n\n        But the problem allows non-overlapping.\n\n        However, is there a substring of length 3 that appears twice? \n\n        Let me check: \n            \"aab\" appears only once.\n            \"aba\" appears only once.\n            \"baa\" appears only once.\n\n        So no.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aabaa\" has two occurrences of \"aa\", but also note: \n            The substring \"aa\" also appears at index1? No, at index1: the substring of length2 starting at index1 is \"ab\", then index2 is \"ba\", then index3 is \"aa\".\n\n        So only two occurrences.\n\n        However, wait: the substring \"aa\" at index0 and index3 are the only two. \n\n        But wait, is there a substring of length 1 that appears more than twice? \n            'a': appears at indices0,1,3,4 -> so four times, but we are looking for the longest substring. The length 1 is shorter than 2, so we don't care.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the two occurrences must be at least twice. So for L=2, we have two occurrences.\n\n        However, what if the problem intended to require two non-overlapping occurrences? The problem statement says \"These occurrences can overlap\", so overlapping is allowed. \n\n        But note: the two occurrences of \"aa\" in \"aabaa\" are not overlapping. \n\n        What about overlapping? For example, if we consider a substring of length 2 that appears twice with overlapping? \n\n        Example: \"aaa\" (which we did) -> two occurrences of \"aa\" that are adjacent (overlap). \n\n        In \"aabaa\", can we have a substring of length 2 that appears twice with overlapping? \n\n            \"aa\" at index0: [0:2]\n            Then the next occurrence would have to start at index1: substring at index1 is \"ab\" -> not \"aa\".\n            Then index2: \"ba\" -> not \"aa\".\n            Then index3: \"aa\" -> but this is not overlapping with the first one.\n\n        So no overlapping occurrence of \"aa\" in \"aabaa\".\n\n        But that doesn't matter because the problem allows non-overlapping.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code uses slicing which for a string of length 100 and L=50, we are creating a substring of length 50. There are about 50 such slices (for one L) and the total worst-case operations is about 5050, but each substring of length L is stored and compared. The comparison of two strings of length L is O(L). \n\n   The total cost is: for each L (from n-1 down to 1) and for each i (from 0 to n-L) we do a substring extraction and a set lookup (which involves comparing the substring with all previously seen substrings? Actually, the set uses hashing, so the cost of inserting and checking is O(L) per operation (for the hash and equality)).\n\n   Therefore, the total operations is:\n\n        For a fixed L: we do (n - L + 1) * (cost of set operation) and the set operation is O(L) because of the substring comparison.\n\n        Then the total for all L is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) * L.\n\n        For n=100, the worst-case is about (100)*(100) * (average L) but wait, we break early when we find a duplicate. However, worst-case (no duplicates) we do the full set for each L.\n\n        The worst-case total operations is about:\n\n            Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100 - L) * L\n\n        We can approximate by integral from 0 to 100 of x*(100-x) dx, but let's compute:\n\n            = Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100*L - L^2)\n\n            = 100 * (sum_{L=1}^{99} L) - (sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2)\n\n            = 100 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6)\n\n        This is a big number, but note: the actual operations are the set operations which involve building the substring and then hashing. The substring of length L takes O(L) to build and O(L) to hash.\n\n        However, 100 is small, but 99*100/2 = 4950, then 4950*100 = 495000, and the sum of squares is about 99*100*199/6 ~ 328350, so total operations ~ 495000 - 328350 = 166650? Actually, no: the formula is:\n\n            Total operations (if no break) = 100 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6) \n            But wait, the set operations for a fixed L: we do (n-L+1) insertions, each insertion costs O(L) (because the substring is of length L and we do hashing and comparison). Similarly, the membership test is O(L).\n\n        Actually, the set operations for a fixed L: \n            The set will have at most (n-L+1) elements, and each element is a string of length L.\n\n        The total work for one L is:\n\n            Building (n-L+1) substrings, each of length L, and then for each insertion we do a hash and possibly a comparison (worst-case O(L)).\n\n        So the work for one L is O((n-L+1)*L).\n\n        Then the total work is O(sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L) = O(n^3) in the worst-case.\n\n        For n=100, the worst-case total operations is:\n\n            Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100 - L + 1) * L = Sum_{L=1}^{99} (101 - L) * L\n\n            = Sum_{L=1}^{99} (101*L - L^2)\n\n            = 101 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6)\n\n            = 101 * 4950 - 328350\n\n            = 500000 - 328350 = 171650 (approximately)\n\n        But note: we are breaking early for each L as soon as we find a duplicate. So in the best-case (if the longest repeated substring is found early) we do very little. In the worst-case (when there is no repeated substring) we do the full sum.\n\n        Since n=100, 171650 is acceptable in Python? Each operation (building a substring and hashing) is O(L). But wait, the building of a substring of length L is O(L) and then the hashing is O(L). So the total operations for one substring is O(L). Then the total for one L is O((n-L+1)*L). \n\n        Actually, the total operations (number of character comparisons) is:\n\n            For one substring: we do L operations to extract the substring (if we do slicing, then it copies the substring, which is O(L)).\n\n            Then for the set: we do a hash computation (which requires scanning the entire substring, so O(L)).\n\n        So the total operations for one L is O((n-L+1)*L). \n\n        Then the overall worst-case is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L+1)*L, which is about 171650 * (average L) ? Actually, no: the factor of L is already included.\n\n        But wait, the expression (n-L+1)*L is the total length of all substrings we consider for that L. However, we are building each substring from scratch, so the total cost is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        And that sum is 171650, which is acceptable for n=100.\n\n        However, wait: the above calculation is the total length of all substrings we build. But note, we break early for each L, so if we break at the first duplicate, we don't build all substrings for that L.\n\n        But worst-case (no duplicates) we do build all substrings for that L.\n\n        The worst-case total length built is 171650, which is about 170 thousand, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by not using slicing but using a rolling hash or something? But the problem is small, so we don't need to.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty and length <=100, so we can stick with the simple method.\n\n   Let me run the code on a worst-case string (all same character) of length 100.\n\n        s = 'a'*100\n\n        Then for L=99: \n            The first substring: 'a'*99, then the next substring: 'a'*99 (from index1) -> duplicate -> break.\n\n        So we only build two substrings of length 99, which is 2*99 = 198 characters.\n\n        Similarly, for the worst-case (no repeated substring) we build all substrings for each L until we break, but the worst-case is when there are no duplicates, then we build all substrings for each L.\n\n        But the worst-case string (no repeated substring) is a string with all distinct substrings? Actually, the number of distinct substrings of a string of length n is O(n^2). But we are breaking by length from large to small.\n\n        However, the worst-case for the algorithm (in terms of total operations) is when there are no duplicates for all L, then we build all substrings for each L.\n\n        The total number of substrings is n*(n+1)//2, which for n=100 is 5050, and the total length of all substrings is:\n\n            Sum_{L=1}^{99} (number of substrings of length L) * L = Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L+1)*L\n\n        Which is 171650, as above.\n\n        But wait, the total length is 171650 characters, and building a substring of length L is O(L), so the total operations is 171650, which is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        # We are going to iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            # Generate all substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                # Extract substring from i to i+L\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(ans)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0.\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2.\n\n   All pass.\n\n   However, note:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of varying lengths and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) that appears more than once in the input string. The key observation here is that the substrings can overlap, meaning two identical substrings can start at different positions within the string.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each possible length, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length as the answer since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1, where n is the string length) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length. If any substring is found more than once, the length is recorded as the answer, and the loop terminates early.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (up to n-1), we might check up to O(n) substrings, each of length O(L), leading to a total of O(n^3) operations in the worst case. However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nans = 0\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            ans = L\n            break\n        seen.add(substr)\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest repeating substring found.\n3. **Iterating Over Lengths**: The loop runs from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks all substrings of that length.\n4. **Checking Substrings**: For each substring of length `L`, it checks if the substring has been seen before using a set. If a duplicate is found, the current length `L` is stored in `ans`, and the loop breaks early to ensure the longest length is found first.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all relevant lengths, the result (either the length of the longest repeating substring or 0 if none are found) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, optimizing both time and space complexity for the given constraints.",
