Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Concatenate the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) to form the expected letters.\n 2. Check that the length of the concatenated string is equal to the length of the third string (the pile).\n 3. Count the frequency of each letter in the concatenated string and compare with the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip newlines.\n - Combine the first two strings: `combined = guest_name + host_name`\n - If the sorted list of combined string is equal to the sorted list of the pile string, then print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n   combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings with newline characters, but we can handle by stripping.\n\n However, the sample input provided is:\n\n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Output: YES\n\n Let's check the lengths:\n   Guest: 10 letters, Host: 9 letters -> total 19\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 19 letters.\n\n Now, we can count the letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can use collections.Counter, but since the problem says the length is at most 100, we can also sort.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   if len(s1+s2) != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note the second example:\n\n   Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Here, expected combined length is len(\"PAPAINOEL\") + len(\"JOULUPUKKI\") = 8+11 = 19.\n   But the pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which has 19 characters.\n\n   But wait: the example output is \"NO\". Why?\n\n   Let's check the example: \n        Expected: \"PAPAINOEL\" and \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   They have different letters? \n\n   Actually, the example says: \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'.\"\n\n   So, we must compare the exact multiset.\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n        Expected: \n            P: 2, A: 1, I: 1, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 2, K: 1\n\n        Pile: \n            J: 1, O: 3, U: 2, L: 2, N: 1, A: 2, P: 1, I: 1, E: 1, K: 1\n\n   So the counts don't match.\n\n   Therefore, the above method using sorted will work.\n\n   But note: the third sample:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Expected: \n            BABBONATALE (11 letters) and FATHERCHRISTMAS (14 letters) -> total 25\n            Pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> 25 letters.\n\n        However, the example output is \"NO\", because there's an extra letter 'L'.\n\n        Let me count the letters in the expected combined:\n\n            BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\n            B: 3, A: 4, O: 1, N: 1, T: 1, E: 1, L: 1\n            F: 1, A: already counted, etc.\n\n        Now, in the pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        There are two 'L's? Actually, the word \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" has one 'L' (in \"CHRISTMAS\" no L, but wait: \n        \"CHRISTMAS\": C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S -> no L. Then where is the extra L?\n\n        Looking at the pile: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        It has two consecutive L's? Actually, the example says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n        In the expected combined, we should have only one 'L' (from \"BABBONATALE\"). But the pile has two L's.\n\n        Therefore, the sorted method would catch this.\n\n   So, the code:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if len(s1+s2) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        sorted(s1+s2) = sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        sorted(s3) = sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n        We can check: both are 19 letters and the multiset is same.\n\n   Example 2:\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n        The sorted(s1+s2) and sorted(s3) are different.\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n        sorted(s1+s2) and sorted(s3) are different.\n\n   This matches the expected outputs.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says the input is given as three lines, and the example input is provided as a list of strings. But our program reads from stdin.\n\n   We'll assume standard input.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (max 100 per line), sorting 200 characters is very fast.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the lengths of the combined names must match the length of the pile, and the multiset of letters in the combined names must exactly match the multiset of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read the three input linesâ€”the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths**: First, verify that the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, it's immediately impossible to form the names from the pile, so the answer is \"NO\".\n3. **Compare Letter Frequencies**: If the lengths match, further verify that the sorted list of letters from the combined names matches the sorted list of letters from the pile. This ensures that all letters are present in the correct quantities without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_length = len(guest) + len(host)\n    if total_length != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three strings from standard input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: The combined length of the guest's and host's names is compared to the length of the pile. If they differ, the program outputs \"NO\" because it's impossible to form the names with the given pile.\n3. **Frequency Check**: The letters from the combined names and the pile are sorted and compared. If the sorted lists match, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, so the program outputs \"YES\". Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the quantity and presence of each letter required to form the names from the pile, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead given the constraints.",
