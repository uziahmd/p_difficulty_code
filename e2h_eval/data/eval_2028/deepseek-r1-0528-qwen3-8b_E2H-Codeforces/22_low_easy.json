After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means having the highest mark in that subject).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? But note the problem says \"best\" if no student has a higher mark.\n    So, if two or more have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n However, note: we cannot simply take the maximum per subject because we need to know the maximum per subject and then check for each student if in at least one subject they have that maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Create a matrix (list of lists) of integers from the input strings.\n   - For each subject j (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student i, check if for any subject j, the student's mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\n But note: the input is given as strings of digits, so we can convert each char to int or keep as char (since the maximum of '9' is greater than '8' etc. but we can also compare by converting to int).\n\n However, let's consider: we have marks from '1' to '9'. We can compare the characters as their ASCII values, but it's easier to convert to integers.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1:\n   Read the data as strings, then convert each character to integer.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"223\", then we can split by nothing, so we have ['2','2','3'] -> [2,2,3]\n\n   Let's create a 2D list of integers.\n\n   Then, for each column j (subject), compute the maximum value in that column.\n\n   Then, for each student i, look at all subjects j. If for any subject j, student[i][j] == max_marks[j], then student i is successful.\n\n   But note: what if there are multiple maximums? Then multiple students will have the max in that subject. That's okay because we only require one subject where they are best.\n\n However, the problem says: \"successful if there exists a subject he is the best at\". And being best means having the highest mark (so equal to the maximum). \n\n But note: if two students tie for the highest mark in a subject, then both are best in that subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   Convert to integers:\n\n      student0: [2, 2, 3]\n      student1: [2, 3, 2]\n      student2: [1, 1, 2]\n\n   For subject0: max is 2 -> student0 and student1 have 2 -> both are best in subject0?\n   For subject1: max is 3 -> only student1 has 3 -> only student1 is best in subject1.\n   For subject2: max is 3 -> only student0 has 3 -> only student0 is best in subject2.\n\n   Now, check each student:\n      student0: subject0 (2==2) -> yes, so successful.\n      student1: subject0 (2==2) -> yes, so successful.\n      student2: no subject has 3 or 2 (in subject0 and subject2: 1<2, subject1: 1<3) -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse input.\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0]); m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        Then next n lines: for i in range(1, n+1): line = data[i].strip()\n\n   Step 2: Create a 2D list `students` of integers, size n x m.\n\n   Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value in that column.\n\n        max_per_subject = [max(students[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        Actually, we can do: \n            max_marks = []\n            for j in range(m):\n                col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n                max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check if there",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in each subject.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Convert each character in the input strings to integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student in the group.\n4. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    n = int(parts[0])\n    m = int(parts[1])\n    \n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        if len(s) < m:\n            s = s.ljust(m, '0')[:m]\n        gradebook.append(s)\n        \n    students = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            row.append(int(gradebook[i][j]))\n        students.append(row)\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if students[i][j] > col_max:\n                col_max = students[i][j]\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the first line to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). It then reads the next n lines, each representing a student's marks in all subjects.\n2. **Data Conversion**: Each character in the input strings is converted to an integer, creating a 2D list where each sublist represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by scanning all student entries for that subject.\n4. **Successful Students Check**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If so, the student is marked as successful.\n5. **Result Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input data, checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, and counts those who excel in at least one subject. The solution handles edge cases such as varying input lengths and ensures accurate results through systematic data processing and comparison.",
