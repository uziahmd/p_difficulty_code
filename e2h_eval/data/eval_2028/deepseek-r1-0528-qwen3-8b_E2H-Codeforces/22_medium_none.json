After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject the maximum mark (since best at subject means having the highest mark in that subject).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? But note the problem says \"best\" if no student has a higher mark.\n    So, if two or more have the same highest mark, then they are all best in that subject.\n\n 4. For each student, we want to check if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n However, note: we cannot simply take the maximum per subject because we need to know the maximum per subject and then check for each student if in at least one subject they have that maximum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Create a matrix (list of lists) of integers from the input strings.\n   - For each subject j (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student i, check if for any subject j, the student's mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\n But note: the input is given as strings of digits, so we can convert each char to int or keep as string (since the maximum of '9' is greater than '2', but actually we can compare characters too because they are digits from '1' to '9').\n\n However, comparing characters is safe because the ASCII value of '1' to '9' is increasing.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1:\n   Let marks = list of n strings (each string of length m)\n\n   Step 1: For each column j, find the maximum character (which will be the same as the maximum digit in that column). Since all are digits, we can do:\n        col_max[j] = max(marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   Step 2: For each student i, we look at each subject j: if marks[i][j] == col_max[j], then in subject j this student is best. We only need one such subject to call the student successful.\n\n   But note: what if two students have the same maximum? Then both are best in that subject. So we don't remove duplicates.\n\n   However, we are only checking for existence of at least one subject where the student has the maximum.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Step 1: \n        Subject0 (first column): ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        Subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        Subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Step 2:\n        Student0: [2,2,3] -> \n            subject0: 2 == '2' -> True (so successful)\n            subject1: 2 != '3' -> False\n            subject2: 3 == '3' -> True (but we only need one, so already found)\n        Student1: [2,3,2] ->\n            subject0: 2=='2' -> True\n            subject1: 3=='3' -> True\n            subject2: 2 != '3' -> False -> successful\n        Student2: [1,1,2] ->\n            subject0: 1 != '2' -> False\n            subject1: 1 != '3' -> False\n            subject2: 2 != '3' -> False -> not successful\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n, m from first line.\n\n   Then read n lines.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        data = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            data.append(s)\n\n   Then, for j in range(m): # for each subject (column index)\n        col = [data[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_char = max(col)\n\n   Then, we can create an array `is_best` for each student? Or we can directly count the successful students.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the maximum for each column and store in a list `max_marks` of length m.\n\n   Then, for each student i (from 0 to n-1), we check for any subject j (from 0 to m-1) such that data[i][j] == max_marks[j]. If we find one, then student i is successful.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't require to list the successful students, only the count.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if data[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n   Print count.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the numbers without spaces. Also, the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n        Let's compute max_marks for each column:\n\n          col0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n          col1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n          col2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n          col3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n          col4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n        Now, check each student:\n\n          Student0: \"91728\"\n            col0: '9' == '9' -> True -> successful.\n\n          Student1: \"11828\"\n            col0: '1' != '9' -> skip\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n          Student2: \"11111\"\n            col0: '1' != '9' -> skip\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        So output 3.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   Edge cases: \n        n=1, m=1: \n            Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n            Then col0: ['5'] -> max is '5'\n            Student0: '5' == '5' -> True -> count=1.\n\n        Another edge: multiple same maximums, but the student is still successful.\n\n   However, note: what if a student has the maximum in two subjects? Then we break early, but that's okay.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: The input might have been provided as a multi-line string? Actually, the problem says: \n        The first input line contains two integers n and m.\n        Next n lines each containing m characters.\n\n   But the example input is given as: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   However, in standard input, we read from stdin. So we use:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   Then the first line is the first element, and the next n lines are the following.\n\n   But the problem says: first line has n and m, then n lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        line1 = input().split()\n        if not line1:\n            # but n and m are at least 1, so normally we have two numbers\n            n = int(line1[0])\n            m = int(line1[1])\n        then for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n\n   However, the problem states the input format, so we can rely on that.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so we don't have to worry about other characters.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            students.append(s)\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each subject (each column)\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break   # no need to check other subjects for this student\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Wait, but wait: the above counts each successful student once, but note: the break is inside the inner loop and after we count the student, we break. Then we move to the next student.\n\n   However, the above code does not work as intended: the break exits the inner loop for the current student, but we are counting the student when we break. That's correct.\n\n   But wait: we are breaking out of the inner loop for the current student, which is correct because we only need one subject where the student is best.\n\n   However, the above code counts the student and breaks, so we don't check the rest of the subjects for that student.\n\n   But note: we are not counting the student multiple times. We are counting the student once and then moving to the next.\n\n   But wait, there's a flaw: we break after the first subject where the student is best, but we are not skipping the rest of the subjects. Actually, we break the inner loop, so we don't check the remaining subjects for the same student. That is efficient.\n\n   However, the above code has a logical error: we break the inner loop and then move to the next student. But the condition for being successful is that there exists at least one subject. So we break as soon as we find one.\n\n   But let me test with the example:\n\n        Example: \n            Student0: [2,2,3] -> \n                j=0: 2 == '2' -> True -> count becomes 1, then break inner loop.\n            Student1: [2,3,2] -> \n                j=0: 2=='2' -> True -> count becomes 2, then break.\n            Student2: [1,1,2] -> \n                j0: 1 != '2' -> skip\n                j1: 1 != '3' -> skip\n                j2: 2 != '3' -> skip -> no break, so not counted.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example output is 2.\n\n   But wait, the example input was:\n\n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   And our code outputs 2.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string that includes the newline? Actually, the input reading is done by `input()` which reads a line and strips it by default (if we use strip). But the problem says the marks are given as characters, and the rows are exactly m characters. So we don't need to worry about extra spaces.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9.\" and the marks in a rows are not separated by spaces.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait: the sample input in the example is given as: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But when we run the program, we read from stdin. The input is provided as separate lines.\n\n   However, the problem says the first line is two integers, then n lines. So the example input would be provided as:\n\n        Input for first sample:\n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n   So we read the first line, then the next three lines.\n\n   But note: the example input string in the problem statement is given as a string that includes the newlines. But our code uses `input()` which reads one line at a time.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input:\n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the same student has multiple best subjects? We break after the first one, but that's okay because we only care if there is at least one.\n\n   However, the above code counts the student as soon as one best subject is found. \n\n   But note: the problem does not require to count the number of best subjects per student, just whether there is at least one.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: the above code does not account for the fact that the same student might have multiple best subjects, but that's okay because we break and count the student once.\n\n   However, there is a subtle issue: the break statement breaks the inner loop, but we are using a for-loop for j in range(m). We break and then the outer loop continues with the next i.\n\n   So we are counting each student only once.\n\n   Let me test with a modified example where one student is best in two subjects:\n\n        Input: \n            2 2\n            99\n            88\n\n        Then:\n            n=2, m=2\n            students = ['99','88']\n            max_marks = [max('9','8') -> '9', max('9','8') -> '9']\n\n        Check student0: \n            j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n        Check student1:\n            j0: '8' != '9' -> skip\n            j1: '8' != '9' -> skip -> not counted.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Another test: two students, two subjects, and both are best in one subject:\n\n        Input:\n            2 2\n            98\n            89\n\n        Then:\n            max_marks: \n                col0: ['9','8'] -> '9'\n                col1: ['8','9'] -> '9'\n\n            Student0: \n                col0: '9' == '9' -> True -> count=1, break.\n            Student1:\n                col0: '8' != '9' -> skip\n                col1: '9' == '9' -> True -> count=2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   One more edge: n=100, m=100, all marks are 1. Then for each subject the max is '1'. Then every student has in every subject the maximum. Then the first subject will make every student successful. So we break for the first subject for every student. The count will be n.\n\n   But wait, the condition: for each student, we check the first subject. Since the first subject's max is '1', and every student's first subject is '1', then every student is successful. So output n.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no students, then n==0, then we output 0. But n>=1 per problem.\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, we can optimize the column extraction by using zip:\n\n        cols = zip(*students)\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\n   Then the rest remains the same.\n\n   Let me rewrite using zip:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        # Transpose the matrix: each column becomes a tuple\n        cols = zip(*students)\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\n   This is more concise.\n\n   Let me test with the first example:\n\n        students = ['223','232','112']\n        zip(*students) gives:\n            ('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')\n        Then max_marks = ['2','3','3'] -> wait, the third column: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n        Then for student0: \n            row0: '2','2','3'\n            Compare: \n                j0: '2' vs '2' -> True -> count++ and break.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   So the code becomes:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n        # Using zip to get columns\n        cols = zip(*students)\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n, m>=1, so we don't have to worry about n==0.\n\n   However, the problem says 1<=n,m<=100, so we are safe.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait, what if we use zip and the number of columns is m? Then it's fine.\n\n   However, note: the input has exactly n rows and each row has exactly m characters, so zip(*students) will produce m tuples, each of length n.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no students, then n==0, but n>=1, so skip.\n        cols = zip(*students)\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input might have multiple lines. Our code reads n lines, and the first line is read by the initial input.\n\n   But wait: the first line is read by `input().split()`, and then we read the next n lines. That's correct.\n\n   But what if the input is provided all at once? The problem says from stdin, and the typical way is line by line.\n\n   We'll assume the input is provided in the standard way.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   It works.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is given as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is exactly as described.\n\n   One more thing: performance. n, m <= 100, so even if we do two nested loops (n*m) and building the columns (n*m) it's acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the code with worst-case: n=100, m=100, then we do 100*100 = 10000 comparisons for the columns, and then 100*100 = 10000 comparisons for the students. So total 20000, which is acceptable.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no students, then n==0, but n>=1, so skip.\n        # Using zip to get columns\n        cols = zip(*students)\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   I think this is the solution.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, and we are comparing characters. Since the characters are digits, and the max function on a list of characters returns the lexicographically largest, which is the same as the numerically largest because '1'<'2'<...<'9', so it's safe.\n\n   However, if the problem had included other characters, we would have to convert to int. But the problem says only digits from 1 to 9.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Let me submit.\n\n   However, note: the problem expects the output to be the single number.\n\n   We output the count.\n\n   Done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Column-wise Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves transposing the matrix of marks (converting rows to columns) and then computing the maximum for each column.\n3. **Successful Students Check**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students. The check stops as soon as one such subject is found for a student to optimize performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ncols = zip(*students)\nmax_marks = [max(col) for col in cols]\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The first line of input is split into two integers, n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent n lines are read as strings, each representing a student's marks across all subjects.\n2. **Transpose and Max Calculation**: The `zip(*students)` function transposes the matrix of marks, converting each row into a column. For each column, the maximum value is found and stored in a list `max_marks`.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student, iterate through their marks in each subject. If any subject's mark matches the corresponding `max_marks` value, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks. The total count of successful students is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance by leveraging column-wise maximum calculations and early termination during the success check, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
