The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (at least one step after the initial) such that the snowflake has n vertices.\n\n How is the snowflake built?\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: add k new vertices -> total = 1 + k\n   Step 2: each of the k leaves (from step 1) must connect to k-1 new vertices (because one edge is already used to connect to the center). Then we add k*(k-1) vertices. Total = 1 + k + k*(k-1)\n   Step 3: then each of the k*(k-1) leaves from step 2 must connect to k-1 new vertices, so we add k*(k-1)*(k-1) vertices. Total = 1 + k + k*(k-1) + k*(k-1)**2\n\n But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\n However, note that the process is defined as:\n   Initially: one vertex (center).\n   Then, the center is connected to k new vertices (so now we have 1+k vertices, and the center has degree k, while the k new ones have degree 1).\n   Then, each of the k leaves (each having degree 1) is connected to k new vertices (so we add k*k vertices? Actually, wait: the rule says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is connected to k new ones. But when we do the second step, the center is no longer a leaf (it's connected to k edges) so we don't touch the center again.\n\n However, in the example with k=4, the smallest snowflake (step 2) would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16 = 21? But the example figure probably shows the first two steps (the initial and the first expansion). Actually, the problem says the smallest possible for k=4 is shown. Let me re-read:\n\n \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the minimal snowflake must have at least two steps: the first step (initial) and then the second step (since we do the expansion at least once).\n\n But note: the first step (from the initial) is the first expansion? Actually, the problem says:\n   - Start with one vertex.\n   - Then (first expansion): connect the initial to k new ones (so we have 1+k).\n   - Then (second expansion): take each of the k leaves (each has degree 1) and connect each to k new ones (so we have 1 + k + k*k). \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (so the leaves) are expanded. But note: the center is not a leaf. In the second step, we have k leaves. Each leaf is expanded: so we add k * k new vertices. Then the total number of vertices is 1 + k + k*k.\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion after the first must be performed at least one time. So the minimal snowflake has two steps: the initial expansion (first step) and then one more expansion (second step). However, we can do more steps.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the process is:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex (center)\n   Step 1: add k -> total = 1 + k\n   Step 2: add k * (k-1) -> because each of the k leaves is connected to k new ones, but note: the center is already connected to that leaf, so the leaf now will be connected to k-1 new ones? Or does the rule say \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" gets k new connections? Then the leaf (with one edge) is connected to k new ones, meaning we add k new edges from that leaf, and hence k new vertices. So we add k*k new vertices.\n\n However, wait: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" So for each such vertex, we add k new edges and k new vertices. Then the leaf becomes connected to 1 (existing) + k (new) = k+1 edges, so it's no longer a leaf.\n\n But note: the expansion step is done at least once, meaning we must have at least two steps. However, the problem does not specify the maximum steps. We can have multiple layers.\n\n Therefore, the total number of vertices for a snowflake built with t layers (steps) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k*k + k*k*k + ... + k^t   ??? \n\n Wait, let's break down:\n\n   Step0: 1\n   Step1: 1 + k\n   Step2: 1 + k + k*k   [because we added k*k from the k leaves, each adding k]\n   Step3: 1 + k + k*k + k*k*k   [because now we have k*k leaves, each adds k]\n\n Actually, in step i, we are adding k^i? Not exactly:\n\n   Step0: center: 1\n   Step1: we add k (which is k^1) -> total = 1 + k\n   Step2: we add k * k (because each of the k from step1 gives k) -> total = 1 + k + k^2\n   Step3: we add k * k * (k) ? No, wait: at step2, we have k^2 leaves (each node in the second layer has degree 1, and there are k^2 of them). Then at step3, we add k^2 * k = k^3.\n\n So the general formula for a snowflake built with m steps (m>=1, meaning we have done m expansions beyond the initial) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m\n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning m>=1 (at least the first expansion, and then at least one more expansion). Actually, the initial expansion is the first step (m=1) and then we require at least one more (so m>=2). However, wait: the problem says:\n\n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n   Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the first expansion (the center expansion) is mandatory, and then the expansion of the leaves (the next step) must be done at least once. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is 2, so m>=2.\n\n However, note: the example input includes n=6, which is \"NO\", and n=13 is \"YES\". Let's check:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, for m>=2 and k>1.\n\n But wait, is that really the formula? Let me think:\n\n   Step0: center (1 vertex)\n   Step1: we add k (so total 1+k) -> but note: the center is connected to k, so the center has degree k, and the k new ones have degree 1. Now, the expansion condition applies to the k leaves (each has degree 1). We do this expansion at least once (so we must do step2).\n\n   Step2: for each of the k leaves, we add k new vertices. So we add k*k. Then the total is 1 + k + k*k.\n\n   Then step3: the leaves now are the k*k from step2, each has degree 1 (since they are connected only to their parent). Then we can expand again, adding k*k*k.\n\n So the total number of vertices is: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, for m>=2.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix m. We can have any m>=2. However, we are given n and we need to know if there exists some k>1 and some m>=2 (integer) such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   [geometric series]\n\n The sum of a geometric series is:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n However, note: m is the exponent of the highest power, and we have m+1 terms (from k^0 to k^m). But our series starts at k^0 (the center) and goes to k^m (the last expansion). So the total number of terms is m+1, and the formula is correct.\n\n But note: the problem requires at least two steps (m>=2) so the minimal n is for m=2: n_min = (k^3 - 1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n However, we can also have more than two steps.\n\n But note: n can be very large (up to 10^18) and t up to 10000, so we cannot iterate over all k and m.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We can also consider that the snowflake graph is built in layers. The center is layer0, then layer1 (k vertices), layer2 (k^2 vertices), etc.\n\n   The total number of vertices is: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\n   We are allowed to choose k>1 and m>=2.\n\n   We can also note that the same n might be expressed in different ways.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require to output the parameters, just \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n   Let's analyze:\n\n   Condition: n must be representable as (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for integers k>1 and m>=2.\n\n   But note: m>=2, so the minimal n for a given k is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2 + k + 1.\n\n   Example: k=2 -> n_min = 7 (for m=2). But the example input includes n=6 -> NO, n=13 -> YES.\n\n   For n=13: \n        13 = 1 + k + k^2 + ... (with m>=2)\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n        m=2: n = 1 + k + k^2 = 13 -> k^2 + k + 1 = 13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1 ± sqrt(1+48) )/2 = (-1±7)/2 -> k=3 (since k>1). So 1+3+9=13 -> YES.\n\n   But wait, what about m=3? Then we have 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = 13. Then k^3+k^2+k+1=13. For k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big. k=1 is not allowed. So only m=2 works for k=3.\n\n   Another example: n=6 -> is there a k>1 and m>=2 such that (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)=6?\n\n        m=2: 1+k+k^2=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(21))/2 -> not integer.\n        m=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=6. k=1: 4 -> too small, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big. So no.\n\n   But wait, note: the problem does not require consecutive layers? Actually, the process is fixed: we do the expansion until we reach the desired number? Actually, the problem says \"a snowflake with n vertices\", so we can stop at any step.\n\n   However, note: the expansion is done step-by-step and the entire graph must be built by the rules.\n\n   Therefore, we must have n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some integer k>1 and integer m>=2.\n\n   But note: we can also have m=1? The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves must be done at least once. The initial expansion (from the center) is the first step, and then the expansion of the leaves is the second step (and we must do at least one of those). So we must have at least two steps. Therefore, m>=2.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" So the first expansion (the center expansion) is the first part, and then the second expansion (on the leaves) is the part that must be done at least once. So we must have at least two steps.\n\n   Therefore, the formula must be for m>=2.\n\n   But note: there is another way to build a snowflake? The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves must be done at least once. However, what if we do the expansion of the leaves more than once? Then we have more layers.\n\n   So the problem reduces to: does there exist an integer k>1 and an integer m>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   However, note that the same n can be represented by different k and m.\n\n   But note: n is fixed and up to 10^18, and we have up to 10000 test cases.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   Observation: The representation as a geometric series is unique for fixed k? But we can vary k and m.\n\n   Since k>=2 and m>=2, then the minimal n is 1+2+4=7 (when k=2, m=2). Also, we can have:\n\n        k=3, m=2: 1+3+9=13\n        k=2, m=3: 1+2+4+8=15\n        k=2, m=4: 1+2+4+8+16=31, etc.\n\n   We need to check for a given n (which can be as large as 10^18) if there exists k>1 and m>=2 such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n   Alternatively, we can note:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n   and note that k^m <= n < (k+1)^{m+1}? Actually, we can try to fix the base k and the exponent m.\n\n   However, note that m can be at most around 60 because 2^60 is about 1e18, so the exponents m are not too large (but k can be large too). \n\n   Another idea: since the series is increasing, we can try to fix the number of layers (m) and then solve for k.\n\n   But note: m>=2, and k>=2.\n\n   We can also consider that for a fixed m, the equation is:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   which is equivalent to:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^(m+1) - 1\n\n        => k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Then, for a fixed m (say from 2 up to a limit) and for k>=2, we can solve for k.\n\n   But note: n can be as large as 10^18, and m can be as large as about 60 (because 2^60 ~ 1e18) so we can iterate over m from 2 to 60 (or log2(n) which is about 60). Then for each m, we need to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   However, note that k is an integer >=2 and we can use binary search for k for a fixed m? But the equation is nonlinear and we are only iterating m from 2 to about 60, and for each m we can try to find k.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that k must be at least 2 and at most around n^(1/(m+1)) (because k^(m+1) is about n*k, so k^m ~ n, so k ~ n^(1/m)). Since m is at least 2, the maximum k we need to check for a fixed m is about n**(1/m). And since m is small (only up to 60) and n is 10^18, then for m=2: k ~ sqrt(n) which is 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n   We need a smarter approach.\n\n   Let me change the perspective: we can consider that the entire snowflake is built by layers, and the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n   We can also write:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   and note that k^(m+1) = (k-1)*n + 1.\n\n   Then, for a fixed m, we can compute k by solving the equation:\n\n        k^(m+1) - (k-1)*n - 1 = 0\n\n   But note: we can also consider that k must be an integer, and we can use binary search for k for fixed m? However, the function f(k) = k^(m+1) is very fast growing, and k must be at least 2 and at most about n**(1/(m+1)) (which for m=2 is sqrt(n) ~ 1e9, and we have 60 values of m, so worst-case 60 * (number of k we test) but we cannot iterate over k from 2 to 1e9).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the equation:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   is a polynomial in k of degree m+1, and we are only interested in integer k>=2.\n\n   We can use the following: for fixed m, the left-hand side (k^(m+1)) must equal the right-hand side (n*(k-1)+1). We can try to find k by iterating over possible bases, but note that k is the base and the exponent is m+1.\n\n   But note: we can also consider that k is the base and m+1 is the exponent. We can take the (m+1)-th root of the right-hand side? Actually, the equation can be written as:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*k - n + 1\n\n   Then, we can use binary search on k for fixed m? The range for k would be from 1 to about n**(1/(m+1)) + 10. But note: for m=2, the root is about sqrt(n) which is 1e9, and we cannot do a binary search for each test case for each m from 2 to 60 (because 10^4 test cases * 60 * log2(1e9) ~ 10^4 * 60 * 30 ~ 18e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious, but note: n is given per test case and we have up to 10000 test cases, so we cannot iterate over m from 2 to 60 for each test case (because 60 * 10000 = 600000, and each binary search might take about 60 iterations (because m+1 is at most 61, but the k we are searching for is in the range [2, n**(1/(m+1))] which is huge for m=2). \n\n   Alternatively, we can fix m and then for each test case, we do a binary search for k for that m? But note: the same n appears multiple times? We have 10000 test cases, and n can be repeated. But worst-case, we have 10000 distinct n's and for each we iterate m from 2 to 60 and do a binary search for k in the range [2, ceil(n**(1/(m+1)))].\n\n   However, the exponentiation for large numbers (like k^(m+1)) is expensive and k can be as large as 10^9 for m=2, and 10^18 is the maximum n, so for m=2, k_max = floor(sqrt(n)) which is 10^9, so the binary search for m=2 would take about 30 steps, but each step does a modular exponentiation? Actually, we are dealing with integers and exponentiation, and the numbers can be very big (like 10^9^3 for m=2? Actually, for m=2, we are checking k^3 (because m+1=3) and k is up to 10^9, then k^3 is 10^27, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, 10^9^3 is 1e27, and we are comparing with n*(k-1)+1 (which is about 10^18 * 10^9 = 10^27) so we are comparing two 10^27 numbers. That is acceptable in Python because integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation might be slow.\n\n   But note: we are doing up to 60 * 30 = 1800 exponentiations per test case? And we have 10000 test cases -> 10000 * 1800 = 18e6 exponentiations? Each exponentiation is a power with exponent m+1 (which is at most 61) and base k (which is up to 10^9). But the exponentiation base k can be up to 10^9 and exponent 60, then k^60 is (10^9)^60 = 10^540, which is too big to store. \n\n   Therefore, we must avoid using such large numbers.\n\n   We need to change our approach.\n\n   Let me think: we have the equation:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   We can rearrange:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   But note: for fixed m, the left-hand side is a polynomial. We are only interested in integer roots k>=2.\n\n   We can use the fact that k must be a divisor of something? Or we can use the rational root theorem: the rational roots of the equation k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0 must be divisors of (n-1) (if we consider the equation as having integer coefficients) but wait, the equation is:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   Actually, the constant term is (n-1) and the leading coefficient is 1, so any integer root must divide (n-1). But wait, the equation is:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   This is not a standard polynomial with integer coefficients in the usual sense because n is variable. Actually, we can consider k as the variable and n as a constant. Then the equation is:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   The rational root theorem says that any rational solution p/q (in reduced form) must have p dividing the constant term (n-1) and q dividing the leading coefficient (1). So the only possibilities are the divisors of (n-1). But note: k is integer and positive, and k>=2.\n\n   Therefore, for fixed m, we can factorize (n-1) and then check the divisors? But n can be up to 10^18, so factorization is too heavy.\n\n   Alternative idea: notice that the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n        k^(m+1) + 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n        => n = (k^(m+1)+1) / (k-1)\n\n   Then, we require that (k^(m+1)+1) is divisible by (k-1). And note that k^(m+1) mod (k-1) is 1 (by Fermat's little theorem for polynomials? Actually, in modular arithmetic: k ≡ 1 (mod k-1), so k^any_power ≡ 1 (mod k-1). Therefore, k^(m+1) ≡ 1 (mod k-1) and then (k^(m+1)+1) ≡ 2 (mod k-1). So we require that (k^(m+1)+1) is divisible by (k-1) if and only if 2 ≡ 0 (mod k-1) -> k-1 divides 2. Therefore, k-1 must be 1 or 2.\n\n   Therefore, k must be 2 or 3.\n\n   Let me check:\n\n        If k=2: then n = (2^(m+1)+1) / (2-1) = 2^(m+1)+1.\n\n        If k=3: then n = (3^(m+1)+1) / (3-1) = (3^(m+1)+1)/2.\n\n   But wait, is that true? The condition we derived is necessary: if k is an integer >=2, then for the equation to hold, k-1 must divide 2. So k-1 can be 1 or 2, so k=2 or 3.\n\n   Therefore, the only possible k are 2 and 3.\n\n   Then the problem becomes: does there exist an integer m>=2 such that either:\n\n        n = 2^(m+1) + 1   OR   n = (3^(m+1)+1)//2   (and the division must be exact)?\n\n   But wait, let me verify with the examples:\n\n        Example n=13: \n            k=2: we need 2^(m+1)+1=13 -> 2^(m+1)=12 -> not a power of 2.\n            k=3: we need (3^(m+1)+1)/2=13 -> 3^(m+1)+1=26 -> 3^(m+1)=25 -> not a power of 3.\n\n        But wait, we found that n=13 was achieved by k=3 and m=2 (but then n=1+3+9=13, which is (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2=13). \n\n        Our derivation above said: the equation is n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). \n\n        But then we rewrote: k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        Then we considered modulo k-1 and got that k^(m+1) ≡ 1 (mod k-1) so (k^(m+1)+1) ≡ 2 (mod k-1). And we said that for the equation to hold, we must have (k^(m+1)+1) divisible by (k-1) -> k-1 divides 2.\n\n        However, note: the equation is k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1, so we have (k^(m+1)+1) = n*(k-1)+2, not n*(k-1)+1. \n\n        I see, I made a mistake: the equation is:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        Then, (k^(m+1)+1) = n*(k-1)+2, so we require that (k^(m+1)+1) is divisible by (k-1)? Actually, no, the equation is directly set to n*(k-1)+1, so we don't need to look at divisibility by k-1 in that way.\n\n        Let me correct:\n\n            We have: k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        Then, modulo (k-1):\n\n            k ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n            => k^(m+1) ≡ 1^(m+1) ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n\n            and n*(k-1)+1 ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n\n        So the equation holds modulo (k-1) for any k, so that doesn't help.\n\n   Let me go back.\n\n   We have: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   This is the sum of the geometric series. \n\n   We can also consider: the equation is equivalent to:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^(m+1)-1\n\n   Then, k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   Now, we can consider that k must be an integer base and m+1 is the exponent.\n\n   We can also note: the minimal value for k is 2, and the maximal m+1 is about 60 (because 2^60 is about 1e18). So for each test case, we can iterate over possible exponents (from 2 to about 60) and for each exponent (which is the number of layers plus one) we can try to find an integer base k such that k^exponent = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   But note: k is at least 2 and the exponent is at least 3 (since m>=2, so m+1>=3). Then we can iterate over exponents from 3 to 60 (or 59, because 2^60 is about 1e18) and then for each exponent, we can solve for k.\n\n   However, we can use the following: for fixed exponent e (>=3) and given n, we are looking for an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n        k^e - n*k + n = 0   [but note: we have k^e = n*k - n + 1]\n\n   This is a polynomial equation in k. We can use binary search for k in the range [2, ceil(n**(1/e))+1] (because k^e <= n*k, so k^(e-1) <= n). But note: k^e = n*k - n + 1, so k^e is about n*k, so k^(e-1) is about n. Then k is about n**(1/(e-1)).\n\n   However, note: the equation is k^e = n*k - n + 1. Since k^e grows faster than linear, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, int(round(n**(1/(e-1)))+10] (but careful: n**(1/(e-1)) might be fractional). \n\n   Steps for fixed exponent e (>=3) and given n:\n\n        low = 2\n        high = int(round(n**(1/(e-1)))) + 10   # but we must be cautious: sometimes the root might be slightly larger, so we can set high = max(2, int(round(n**(1/(e-1)))*2)) but better to use an exponential search.\n\n   However, we can use:\n\n        We know k must satisfy: k^e = n*k - n + 1.\n\n        We can rearrange: k^e - n*k + n - 1 = 0.\n\n        And note: k^e is dominant. We can approximate k as roughly (n)^(1/(e-1)) because from k^e ~ n*k, so k^(e-1) ~ n.\n\n   Then, we can set:\n\n        low = 2\n        high = 10**6   # but wait, n can be 10^18, and e-1 can be 2, then k ~ 10^9, so we cannot set high to 10**6.\n\n   We need to set high to something like:\n\n        high = 2\n        while high**(e) < n*high - n + 1:\n            high *= 2\n\n        Then we do binary search between low and high.\n\n   But note: we are iterating over exponents from 3 to 60, and for each exponent we do a binary search. The exponentiation for k^e: k can be as large as 10^9 (for e=3) and then k^e is 10^27, which is acceptable for comparison (we are only storing the result and comparing with n*high - n + 1, which is about n*10^9, and n is 10^18, so 10^27 vs 10^27). But we are doing about 60 * (log2(10^9) ~ 30) = 1800 exponentiations per test case? And each exponentiation for exponent e (which is at least 3 and at most 60) and base k (which can be up to 10^9) is O(e) multiplications? But 60 is small, so even if we do 1800 * 60 multiplications, that's 108000 multiplications per test case, and we have 10000 test cases -> 10^4 * 10^5 = 10^9 operations, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n   However, note: we are only doing one exponentiation per binary search step, and the binary search steps are about 30 per exponent. And we are iterating over exponents from 3 to 60 (58 exponents). So per test case: 58 * 30 = 1740 exponentiations. Each exponentiation is for base k (which is an integer) and exponent e (which is from 3 to 60). The base k is in the range [2, ...] and the exponent e is fixed for the current exponent. The exponentiation k^e: for k up to 10^9 and e=60, then k^e is (10^9)^60 = 10^540, which is a number with 540 digits, and that is too big to compute in practice (both in terms of time and memory). \n\n   We must avoid computing k^e for k as large as 10^9 and e=60.\n\n   Alternative: we can use logarithms? But we are dealing with integers and equality.\n\n   Another idea: we can avoid iterating over all exponents from 3 to 60 for each test case. Notice that the exponent e (which is m+1) is the number of layers (m) plus one, and the minimal value for e is 3 and the maximal is about 60. But note: for a fixed n, the base k must be at least 2 and the exponent e must be at least 3, and we have:\n\n        k^e = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   We can instead iterate over k first? But k can be very large.\n\n   Let me think differently: note that the equation:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n   can be written as:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   and we know that k must be an integer>=2 and m>=2.\n\n   There is a well-known fact: the representation of n as a geometric series with integer base k>=2 is very limited. In fact, we can fix k=2 and k=3 and then consider higher bases only for small exponents.\n\n   But note: k can be any integer>=2, but the exponent m+1 is at least 3 and at most about 60 (because 2^60 ~ 1e18). Therefore, for a fixed k, we can iterate over exponents from 3 to 60 and compute the geometric series and check if it equals n.\n\n   Then, we can iterate k from 2 up to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single central vertex and expanding outward in each subsequent layer. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series with integer base \\( k > 1 \\) and at least two expansion steps (i.e., \\( m \\geq 2 \\)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph's vertex count follows a geometric series: \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\), where \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\). This can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( n \\) to be valid, there must exist integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n \\) equals the sum of the geometric series. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can limit our search for \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) by considering that \\( k \\) must be at least 2 and \\( m \\) must be such that \\( k^m \\) does not exceed \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of \\( k \\) starting from 2 upwards. For each \\( k \\), compute the minimal \\( m \\) (at least 2) such that the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) exceeds \\( n \\). If at any point the sum equals \\( n \\), then \\( n \\) is valid. To optimize, break early if the sum exceeds \\( n \\) or if \\( k \\) becomes too large (since \\( k^m \\) grows rapidly).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible \\( k \\) values up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) (since \\( k^2 \\leq n \\)), ensuring it handles the upper constraint \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\) effectively. The number of operations per test case is manageable due to the rapid growth of \\( k^m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n <= 1:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        k = 2\n        while True:\n            total = 1 + k\n            term = k * k\n            m = 2\n            while term <= n // k and total + term <= n:\n                total += term\n                m += 1\n                term *= k\n                if total == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n            k += 1\n            if k * k * k > n:\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is 1 or less, it immediately outputs \"NO\" since a valid snowflake requires at least two layers (initial and one expansion).\n3. **Iterating Over Bases \\( k \\)**: For each \\( k \\) starting from 2, the algorithm calculates the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots \\) until the sum either matches \\( n \\) or exceeds it.\n4. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks as soon as the sum matches \\( n \\) (output \"YES\") or when further increments of \\( k \\) would not yield a valid solution (output \"NO\").\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible \\( k \\) values by leveraging the geometric series properties and early termination, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
