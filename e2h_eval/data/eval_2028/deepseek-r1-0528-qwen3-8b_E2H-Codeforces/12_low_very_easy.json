The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can move only clockwise.\n\n The key observation: \n   Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the order given. However, note that the condition says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" so we must do the tasks in the given order.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that she goes to the next task without revisiting a house? Actually, the movement is along the ringroad (clockwise) and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit.\n\n Important: The ringroad is circular. So if she is at house x and wants to go to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is y - x.\n   If x > y: then the distance is (n - x + y) because we can go from x to n, then wrap around to 1 and then to y? Actually, since it's a ring of n houses, the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n        if x <= y: y - x\n        else: (n - x) + y\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Steps: \n        Start at 1 -> needs to go to 3: \n            Option 1: 1->2->3 (distance 2)\n        Then from 3 to 2: \n            But wait, from 3 to 2 clockwise: 3->4->1->2 (distance 3) OR 3->4->1->2 is 3 steps? \n            But note: the example says the sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps for 3 tasks.\n\n However, let's break down the example:\n\n   Task 1: at house 3 -> from 1 to 3: 2 steps (1->2->3)\n   Then, we are at 3. Next task is at house 2. But from 3 to 2, we have two ways?\n        Actually, the ring is clockwise only. So from 3 we can only go to 4, then 1, then 2. That's 3 steps (3->4: 1, 4->1: 1, 1->2: 1 -> total 3 steps).\n   Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n\n   Total steps: 2 (for first task) + 3 (from 3 to 2) + 1 (from 2 to 3) = 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   The entire journey is a sequence of moves from the current position to the next task's house, but we must account for the circularity.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let current = 1 (start)\n   total_time = 0\n   For each task location a_i in the list of tasks (in order):\n        Let d = the clockwise distance from current to a_i.\n        total_time += d\n        current = a_i\n\n How to compute d?\n\n   We can do:\n        If current <= a_i: d = a_i - current\n        Else: d = (n - current) + a_i\n\n But wait, the example: current=3, a_i=2 -> current>a_i -> d = (4-3)+2 = 1+2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n However, note that the problem states that Xenia must complete the tasks in the given order and the ringroad is clockwise.\n\n But note: there might be consecutive same houses. Then the distance is 0.\n\n Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 2 -> distance = 2-1 = 1 (if 1<=2 -> yes). Now at 2.\n   Second task: 3 -> distance = 3-2 = 1. Now at 3.\n   Third task: 3 -> distance = 0.\n\n   Total time = 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n However, the example output is 2.\n\n But wait, the example input was provided as two examples. The second example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n However, the first example input was \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", which gives 6.\n\n So the above method works for these examples.\n\n But note: the problem constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we must do this in O(m).\n\n However, we can also consider: what if we are going from a house to a house that is behind? The above formula holds",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad consists of `n` houses arranged in a clockwise order, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. The tasks must be completed in the given order, and Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 and initialize a variable `total_time` to accumulate the total time taken.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location in the list of tasks:\n   - Calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the next task's house.\n   - If the current house is less than or equal to the next task's house, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the current house is greater than the next task's house, the distance is calculated as `(n - current) + next_task`, accounting for the circular nature of the ringroad.\n3. **Update current position**: After moving to the next task's house, update the current position to this house.\n4. **Accumulate time**: Add the calculated distance to `total_time`.\n5. **Output the result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated `total_time`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular structure of the ringroad and processes each task in linear time, making it optimal for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for task in tasks:\n        if current <= task:\n            distance = task - current\n        else:\n            distance = (n - current) + task\n        \n        total_time += distance\n        current = task\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of houses), `m` (number of tasks), and the list of task locations.\n- **Loop through tasks**: For each task, the code calculates the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's location. If the current position is less than or equal to the task's location, the distance is straightforward. Otherwise, it wraps around the ringroad.\n- **Update and accumulate**: The current position is updated to the task's location, and the distance is added to the total time.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia's movements are optimized for the circular path, minimizing the total time required to complete all tasks in the specified order. The solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks.",
