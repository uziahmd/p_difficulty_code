His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour scores (a) and the second tour scores (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x\", and we don't know which one is Vasya's.\n\n However, note that the input does not specify which participant is Vasya. The catch: the two tours' results are given without names. So we have to consider that Vasya could be any participant? Actually, no: the problem states that Vasya was present, so there must be an assignment of the two arrays to participants such that one participant (Vasya) has a score from the first array and another from the second array (but wait, actually: the two scores for Vasya are one from the first tour and one from the second tour, but we don't know which ones). However, note: the two scores for Vasya are given by two indices: one index i for the first tour and one index j for the second tour.\n\n But wait: the input gives two separate lists for the two tours, each with n numbers. And the problem says: the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour (each list of n numbers) but no names.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\". Each participant has two scores. Therefore, we have two arrays of length n: one for the first tour and one for the second tour. But the same participant appears in both? Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\"\n\n But the issue is: we don't know which score in the first tour corresponds to which score in the second tour. However, the teacher has two lists of n integers. So we can assume that the two lists are the two sets of scores for the n participants (without knowing the pairing).\n\n Now, the problem: find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that Vasya has a total of at least x points (from the two tours). But note: the problem says \"at least x points for both tours\", meaning the sum of his two scores is at least x.\n\n 2. However, the catch: we don't know which two scores (one from the first list and one from the second list) belong to Vasya. So we have to consider all possibilities?\n\n Actually, we can think as follows: we have n participants. Each participant i has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second tour. But the pairing is arbitrary. Therefore, we can form an array of the total points for each participant by taking a pair (a_i, b_j) for some permutation. However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the two lists to the same set of participants.\n\n But note: the problem says the teacher has the results of the first and second tour (two arrays). So we have two multisets: A (first tour) and B (second tour). Then, the total points for the participants are the multiset {a + b' | a in A, b' in B}? Actually, no: because each participant has one score from A and one from B. So we are going to assign each element of A to one element of B (a bijection). However, the problem does not require the same ordering. But note: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\" — these are two independent lists.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let S be the set of all participants. Each participant is defined by a pair (p, q) where p is from A and q from B. But we are free to assign the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the two lists are given and we are to consider that the same participant's two scores come from the two lists. But the pairing is arbitrary. So we can form a list of n pairs (a_i, b_j) by matching arbitrarily. Then the total points for each participant is the sum of the two.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", and the teacher has two lists. So we can rearrange the second list arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", so we have two sets of n numbers. Then, the entire set of participants is characterized by the multiset of pairs (a, b) where a is from the first list and b is from the second list, and we use all elements.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the two lists are the same set of participants. It says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". Therefore, the two lists are two different sets of scores for the same set of participants.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the order of the second list corresponds to the first. So we are free to assign the second list arbitrarily to the participants (i.e., we can reorder the second list arbitrarily).\n\n Therefore, we can form a list of pairs (a_i, b_j) for all i and j? Actually, no: we have exactly n participants, so we need to form n pairs. But note: the two lists have n elements each. So we are going to form a perfect matching between the two lists.\n\n But here's the key: we are allowed to choose which participant is Vasya. However, the condition is: there exists an assignment (matching) and a participant (Vasya) such that the two scores (one from A and one from B) assigned to him sum to at least x.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours\". This implies that we know that there is at least one participant (Vasya) who has a total of at least x. But also, we are told that such a participant exists.\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that Vasya is one particular element. Actually, we are told that Vasya was present, meaning there is at least one pair (a_i, b_j) (with i and j being the same index? or arbitrary?) such that a_i + b_j >= x. However, note: the two lists are independent. Actually, the problem does not specify that the two scores for Vasya are from the same index. So we can choose any element from A and any element from B (and we must use each element exactly once). But wait: the two lists are for the same set of participants. So actually, the correct interpretation is: we have two lists of n numbers. Each participant gets one number from the first list and one from the second list. Therefore, the entire set of participants is described by the multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for a fixed matching. However, the problem does not fix the matching.\n\n Therefore, we can choose the matching arbitrarily. Then, we can choose which participant is Vasya (as long as there is at least one participant with total >= x). But note: the condition is that Vasya has at least x, so we can choose a matching and then assign one of the participants (the one with total >= x) to be Vasya.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to assign Vasya arbitrarily. We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got, assuming that the rest of the participants are arranged arbitrarily (by the jury) and we can choose the matching arbitrarily.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are free to choose a matching (bijection) between the two lists. Then, we can assign Vasya to be any participant that has a total >= x.\n\n 2. But note: the problem says \"Vasya got at least x\", so we are guaranteed that at least one participant (in the matching) has total >= x.\n\n 3. We want to compute:\n    - Best place: the highest rank (lowest number) that Vasya can get.\n    - Worst place: the lowest rank (highest number) that Vasya can get.\n\n 4. The ranking is done by the total points (sum of two tours). If two participants have the same total, the jury can assign the places arbitrarily (so they can break ties arbitrarily).\n\n How to solve?\n\n Idea:\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Let T be the set of all possible total points for a participant. Since we can assign arbitrarily, the set of totals we can form is the set of all pairs (a, b) such that a is from A and b is from B, but we must use each element exactly once. However, note: the matching is a bijection, so we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n But wait, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form any set of n pairs (a_i, b_j) with each a_i used once and each b_j used once.\n\n Then, the entire set of totals is the set of the sums of the pairs in the matching.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. So we can choose the matching that minimizes Vasya's total (if we want to put him as low as possible) or maximizes it (if we want to put him as high as possible). But note: the problem is about the rank of Vasya, and the rank depends on the other participants as well.\n\n Actually, we have to consider:\n\n For a fixed matching, we have n totals. Then we sort the totals (from highest to lowest) and assign ranks: the highest total gets rank 1, then the next highest gets rank 2, etc. If there are ties, the jury can assign the lower rank arbitrarily to Vasya (for best place) or force Vasya to get a worse rank (for worst place).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, and then we are allowed to assign the ties arbitrarily. But the problem asks for the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n How do we define the best and worst?\n\n In the best case, we want Vasya to have as high a rank as possible (i.e., as few participants above him as possible). In the worst case, we want as many participants above him as possible (or as low a rank as possible).\n\n But note: the condition is that Vasya has at least x. So we are only considering matchings where at least one participant (Vasya) has total >= x.\n\n However, we are free to choose which participant is Vasya? Actually, no: the problem states that the teacher knows Vasya got at least x. But the catch: the matching is arbitrary and the assignment of the two lists is arbitrary. So we can choose the matching and then choose Vasya to be the participant with the total >= x that we want (if there are multiple, we can choose one of them).\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that Vasya is fixed. We are to consider the best and worst scenario for Vasya, meaning we can choose the matching and then choose Vasya (from the participants that have total>=x) to be the one that gets the best rank or the worst rank.\n\n However, the problem says \"Vasya got at least x\", so we know he has at least x, but we don't know which one. Actually, the problem says \"find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won\", meaning we are to consider all possible ways to assign the two lists (i.e., matchings) and then for each matching, consider all participants that have total>=x, and then take the best and worst rank over these possibilities.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Step 1: Precompute the two lists A and B.\n\n Step 2: We can form a matching arbitrarily. Then, the entire set of totals is the multiset {a_i + b_{\\sigma(i)} for i=0 to n-1} for some permutation σ.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose σ arbitrarily.\n\n Then, we are to find:\n\n   Best place: the minimum rank that Vasya can achieve (i.e., the highest rank number, but wait: rank 1 is the best, so we want the smallest integer rank that Vasya can be placed, meaning the highest position).\n\n   Worst place: the maximum rank that Vasya can achieve (i.e., the largest integer rank, meaning the worst position).\n\n However, note: the problem's example: \n      Input: \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n      Output: \"1 5\"\n\n Explanation: In this case, every participant has total 2. Then, the jury can assign Vasya any rank from 1 to 5.\n\n But wait: the condition is that Vasya has at least x (which is 2). In this case, every participant has 2, so Vasya is one of them. Then the jury can assign the same rank arbitrarily to multiple participants? Actually, the problem says: if two or more participants have the same total, it's up to the jury. So the jury can decide the order arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, the best place is 1 (if we assign the first place to Vasya) and the worst place is 5 (if we assign the last place to Vasya).\n\n Approach:\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n To compute the best place (minimum rank):\n\n   We want to maximize Vasya's total (to be as high as possible) and minimize the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total, and then for those with the same total, we can break the tie in favor of Vasya (so that he gets the best possible rank among the ones with the same total).\n\n But note: we can choose the matching arbitrarily. So we can also assign the rest of the participants to have as low a total as possible, and then set Vasya's total to be as high as possible (if we want to minimize his rank).\n\n However, we must satisfy that Vasya has at least x. But we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can set Vasya's total to any value that is the sum of one element from A and one element from B, as long as that sum is at least x, and we can assign the remaining elements arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the matching uses all elements. So we cannot assign Vasya's total arbitrarily without affecting the rest.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n 1. We can compute the best possible total for Vasya: max_a in A and max_b in B? Not necessarily, because if we assign the maximums to Vasya, then the rest of the participants are formed by the remaining elements. But wait: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the two highest scores (from A and B) to Vasya? Actually, no: because the matching is a bijection. So we can assign one element from A and one from B arbitrarily. Therefore, the best total for Vasya is max{ a+b } for a in A, b in B, but note: we are using all elements. However, we are allowed to assign the rest arbitrarily. So we can choose Vasya's total to be the maximum possible (by picking the two largest numbers: the largest in A and the largest in B) and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n Similarly, the worst total for Vasya is the minimum possible total that is at least x? Actually, no: we are constrained by the condition that Vasya has at least x. But we want to minimize his rank (for worst place) and maximize his rank (for best place). \n\n However, note: the rank is determined by the entire set of totals. So:\n\n For the best place (minimizing Vasya's rank):\n\n   We want to set Vasya's total to be as high as possible, and then set as many participants as possible to have totals less than or equal to Vasya's total (but we can break ties arbitrarily in his favor).\n\n   But note: we can also set the rest of the participants to have totals as high as possible? Actually, no: we want to minimize the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than Vasya's.\n\n   Steps for best place:\n\n     - Choose Vasya's total to be the maximum possible (so that as few participants as possible have a total higher than his). However, is that always true? Consider: if we set Vasya's total to a high value, then the rest of the participants might have even higher totals? But we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily. So we can assign the remaining elements to form as many high totals as we want, but we cannot exceed the maximum total (because the two lists are fixed). Actually, the maximum total is fixed: the maximum element in A plus the maximum element in B.\n\n     However, we can also choose Vasya's total to be a value that is not the maximum, but then we might have fewer participants with a total higher than his? \n\n     Example: \n        A = [10, 1], B = [10, 1]\n        Condition: x = 10 (at least 10)\n\n        Option 1: Assign Vasya (10,10): total=20. Then the other participant gets (1,1): total=2. Then Vasya's rank is 1.\n        Option 2: Assign Vasya (1,10): total=11. Then the other participant gets (10,1): total=11. Then the two participants have the same total. Then the jury can assign Vasya to be first (best) or second (worst). But note: we are computing the best place (minimum rank). In this case, the minimum rank is 1.\n\n        However, what if we try to set Vasya's total to 11 (which is the minimum total that is >=10)? Then the other participant also has 11. Then we can break the tie arbitrarily. So the best place for Vasya is 1.\n\n     But now, what if we set Vasya's total to 20 (the maximum)? Then we have one participant above him? No, no one has a total greater than 20, so he is first.\n\n     So the best place is 1.\n\n     However, consider: \n        A = [10, 1], B = [10, 1], x=10\n\n        We can also set Vasya's total to 11 (from (1,10)) and then the other participant has 11 (from (10,1)). Then the two are tied. But the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily. So in the best case, the jury can assign Vasya the first place.\n\n     Therefore, the best place is 1.\n\n     How to compute the best place?\n\n     Let M be the maximum total (max(A)+max(B)).\n\n     We can assign Vasya the maximum total? Then the rest of the participants are assigned the remaining elements. Then we count the number of participants that have total > M? None. Then the number of participants that have total == M? Only Vasya? Or possibly others? \n\n     Actually, we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily. So we can set Vasya's total to M, and then set the rest of the participants to have totals as low as possible. Then the number of participants with total > Vasya's total is 0, so his rank is 1 (unless there is a tie, but we can break the tie in his favor).\n\n     However, what if there are multiple participants that can have the same total M? Then we must assign Vasya one of the M's. Then the number of participants with total >= M is at least 1 (Vasya) and the rest (if any) have total <= M. But we can break the tie arbitrarily, so we can assign Vasya the first place.\n\n     Therefore, the best place is always 1? \n\n     Wait: consider if there is no participant with total M? Actually, no: because we are assigning the maximum element from A and the maximum element from B to Vasya. Then the rest of the participants are assigned the remaining elements. Then the maximum total in the entire set is M (by Vasya). So no one else has total M.\n\n     But wait: what if the maximum element in A and B are not unique? Then we can assign two participants to have total M? \n\n     Example: A = [10,10], B=[10,10]. Then we can assign Vasya one (10,10) and then the other participant (10,10) also has total 20. Then there are two participants with 20. Then the jury can assign Vasya to be first, second, or ... but wait, we have two participants. Then the best place for Vasya is 1 (if the jury decides to put him first) and the worst is 2.\n\n     However, the problem asks for the best and worst place. So we are to compute separately.\n\n     Therefore, for the best place (minimum rank):\n\n        We want to maximize Vasya's total (to M) and then minimize the number of participants that have total > Vasya's total (which is 0) and then in the group of participants with total == Vasya's total, we can assign him the first place. But wait, we can also have multiple participants with total M. How many participants have total M?\n\n        Actually, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. So we can choose to assign Vasya the maximum total, and then the remaining elements might form one or more participants with total M? \n\n        Let:\n          Let A_sorted = sorted(A, reverse=True)\n          Let B_sorted = sorted(B, reverse=True)\n\n        Then, the maximum total is M = A_sorted[0] + B_sorted[0].\n\n        Now, how many participants can have total >= M? Actually, the maximum total is M, and we can have at most k participants with total M, where k is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= M? But note: we are using all elements.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          Let c = the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b >= M.\n\n        But wait, we are forming a matching. The maximum number of participants that can have total >= M is limited by the available elements.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          To form a participant with total >= M, we need a pair (a, b) such that a + b >= M.\n\n        But note: we are free to assign arbitrarily. So we can assign the top k pairs (by total) arbitrarily.\n\n        However, for the best place for Vasya:\n\n          We want to assign Vasya the highest possible total (M) and then minimize the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than M (which is 0, because M is the maximum). Then, we want to minimize the number of participants that have total equal to M (excluding Vasya) because the jury can break the tie arbitrarily in favor of Vasya. Actually, we can control the matching so that as few participants as possible have total M (other than Vasya).\n\n        How to minimize the number of participants with total M (apart from Vasya)?\n\n          We can assign the largest elements to Vasya and then assign the remaining elements in such a way that we avoid forming as many M as possible.\n\n        However, note: we are not required to minimize the number of M's, because the problem says the jury can break ties arbitrarily. For the best place, we can assume that the jury breaks the tie in our favor (so we can be the first even if there are others with the same total). But wait: the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily, but we are trying to find the best and worst place that Vasya can get. \n\n        Actually, the problem allows us to choose the matching arbitrarily and then the jury assigns the places arbitrarily. So for the best place, we can choose the matching so that Vasya gets a high total, and then we can break the ties arbitrarily (so we can be the first). But we are also constrained by the fact that the matching must use all elements.\n\n        However, note: the condition is that Vasya has at least x. We are not forced to use the maximum total for Vasya. We can use a lower total for Vasya, but then we might have fewer participants above him.\n\n        Actually, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily and then choose which participant is Vasya (from those with total>=x). So we can choose a matching and then select a participant (from the ones with total>=x) that minimizes his rank.\n\n        Therefore, the best place is computed by:\n\n          Step 1: Form a list of all possible totals from the two lists (but we are constrained by the matching). Actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so the entire set of totals is the set of the sums of the pairs in the matching.\n\n          Step 2: We are to choose a matching and then choose one participant (with total>=x) that minimizes his rank.\n\n        How to minimize his rank?\n\n          We want to maximize his total (so that as few participants as possible have a higher total) and then, for the same total, we don't care because the jury can break the tie arbitrarily (so we can be the first in the group of same total).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can set Vasya's total to the maximum total (M) and then the rest of the participants cannot have a total greater than M. Then his rank is the number of participants with total > M (which is 0) plus 1 (if we break the tie arbitrarily, we can be the first). However, if there are other participants with total M, then his rank might be pushed down if the jury does not break the tie in his favor? \n\n        Actually, the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily. So we can choose the matching and then choose the jury's decision. Therefore, we can force the jury to assign Vasya the best possible rank.\n\n        Therefore, the best place is 1.\n\n        But wait: what if Vasya's total is not the maximum? Then there might be participants with higher totals. But we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can set Vasya's total to be the maximum. Then the best place is 1.\n\n        However, consider: what if the condition x is very high? For example, if x is greater than the maximum total M? Then Vasya cannot be assigned the maximum total. Then we have to assign Vasya a total that is at least x, but the maximum total is less than x? Then the problem condition fails. But the problem guarantees that there exists a matching such that at least one participant has total>=x.\n\n        So we can assume that the maximum total M (over all pairs) is at least x? Actually, no: because the matching is a bijection, the maximum total we can form for one participant is M, but we might not be able to assign the two maximums to the same participant? \n\n        Actually, the two maximums (largest in A and largest in B) are distinct participants. But wait: no, the two lists are independent. We can assign the largest element from A and the largest element from B to the same participant. \n\n        Therefore, the maximum total M is the sum of the two largest elements (one from A and one from B). \n\n        However, note: the two largest elements might be from the same participant? Actually, no: because the participant is defined by one element from A and one from B. So the maximum total is indeed the maximum of (a+b) for a in A and b in B.\n\n        But wait, we are forming a matching (bijection) so we cannot assign the same element twice. But the two lists are independent. So the maximum total is simply max(A) + max(B)? \n\n        Actually, no: because the maximum element of A and the maximum element of B might not be available at the same time? \n\n        Example: A = [10, 1], B = [9, 1]. Then the maximum total is 10+9=19. But if we assign 10 from A and 9 from B to the same participant, then the other participant gets 1 and 1. \n\n        So yes, the maximum total is max(A)+max(B) because the two maximums can be assigned to the same participant.\n\n        Therefore, the best place is always 1? \n\n        Let me test with the example: \n            Input: \"6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4\"\n\n            Output: \"1 5\"\n\n        Here, n=6, x=7.\n\n        The maximum total is max(A)=6, max(B)=8 -> 14. Then we can assign Vasya 6 and 8 (if we can match 6 from A and 8 from B to the same participant). Then his total is 14, which is >=7. Then the best place is 1.\n\n        But the example output is \"1 5\", meaning the best place is 1 and the worst place is 5.\n\n        So the best place is 1, but the worst place is 5.\n\n        Therefore, the above reasoning for the best place holds.\n\n        Now, for the worst place (maximize Vasya's rank):\n\n          We want to assign Vasya a total that is as low as possible (but at least x) and then maximize the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total.\n\n          Then, his rank will be (number of participants with total > Vasya's) + 1 (if we break the tie arbitrarily, we can be after all the ones with higher total, and then the ones with the same total can be broken arbitrarily to push him further, but note: the worst place is the maximum rank he can get, so we want to be as low as possible).\n\n        Steps for worst place:\n\n          Let Vasya's total be s (>=x). We want to maximize the number of participants with total > s.\n\n          How to maximize the number of participants with total > s?\n\n          We can choose s to be the minimum total that is at least x (call it s_min) and then assign the rest of the participants to have totals as high as possible.\n\n          However, we are constrained by the matching. We must use all elements.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Step 1: We want to choose a matching such that Vasya has total s (>=x) and as many participants as possible have total > s.\n\n            Step 2: Then, Vasya's rank is (number of participants with total > s) + 1 (if there are ties, the worst case is that all participants with total == s are placed after Vasya, so his rank is (count(participants with total>s) + 1) plus the number of participants with total == s? Actually, no: the ranking goes by:\n\n                Rank 1: highest total\n                Rank 2: next highest\n                ...\n\n            But if there are ties, the jury can assign arbitrarily. For the worst place, we assume that the jury puts Vasya as far as possible (last). So his rank would be:\n\n                (number of participants with total > s) + (number of participants with total == s) + 1\n\n            However, wait: if there are participants with total > s, then they are ranked above Vasya. Then the participants with total == s are then ranked below? Actually, no: the problem says the table sorts by the sum of points. So the participants with total > s are above Vasya, and then the participants with total == s are interspersed arbitrarily. But the jury can assign arbitrarily, so they can put all the participants with total == s arbitrarily. In the worst case, we want to put Vasya as low as possible, so we assume that all participants with total == s are placed above Vasya? Actually, no: the problem says the table is sorted by total (decreasing). Then the participants with total == s are in the same group. The jury can assign the same total arbitrarily. So to minimize Vasya's rank, we can assume that the participants with total > s are first, then the participants with total == s (including Vasya) are next, and then the participants with lower total are last. But the jury can break the tie arbitrarily, so they can put Vasya at the end of the block of total s.\n\n            Therefore, the rank of Vasya is:\n\n                (number of participants with total > s) + 1   [if we put Vasya first in his block] \n                OR \n                (number of participants with total > s) + (number of participants with total == s) + 1   [if we put Vasya last in his block]\n\n            But wait, the problem says the teacher has to know the best and worst place. The best place is the minimum rank Vasya can get, and the worst place is the maximum rank.\n\n            Therefore, for a fixed s (Vasya's total), the minimum rank Vasya can get is:\n\n                r_min(s) = (number of participants with total > s) + 1   (because the jury can put him first in his block)\n\n            And the maximum rank Vasya can get is:\n\n                r_max(s) = (number of participants with total >= s)   (because the jury can put him last in his block, so his rank is the size of the set of participants with total >= s? Actually, no: the ranking is by decreasing total. The participants with total > s are above, and then the ones with total == s are together. Then the rank of the first participant with total == s is (number of participants with total > s) + 1, and the last participant with total == s is (number of participants with total > s) + (number of participants with total == s). Then the participants with total < s are after.\n\n            But note: the problem does not require that the entire set of participants is considered. The rank is defined by the entire set.\n\n            Actually, the rank is defined by the number of participants with a strictly higher total, plus one. But if there are ties, then the rank is not uniquely defined. However, the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily. So the best rank for Vasya is:\n\n                r_best = (number of participants with total > s) + 1\n\n            And the worst rank for Vasya is:\n\n                r_worst = (number of participants with total >= s)\n\n            But wait: if there are k participants with total > s, then the next available ranks are from k+1 to k + (number of participants with total == s) (if we break the tie arbitrarily). Then the worst rank for Vasya is k + (number of participants with total == s) (if the jury puts him at the end of the block of s). But note: there might be participants with total < s, but they don't matter for the rank of Vasya because they are below him.\n\n            However, the entire set of participants is n. The rank is the position (starting at 1). The worst place is the largest number we can assign to Vasya.\n\n            Actually, the worst place is the maximum rank Vasya can get, which is the total number of participants that are not worse than him? Actually, no: the rank is determined by the number of participants that are strictly better (with higher total) and then the ties.\n\n            The rank of Vasya is at least (number of participants with total > s) + 1, and at most (number of participants with total >= s) (if we consider that the block of s is broken arbitrarily and we put him last).\n\n            But note: the problem does not require to consider the entire set of participants? Actually, we are comparing Vasya to all participants.\n\n            However, we are free to choose the matching and then the s (Vasya's total) and then the assignment of the rest.\n\n            Therefore, for the worst place:\n\n                We want to choose s (>=x) and a matching such that the rank of Vasya is as high as possible.\n\n                We can choose s to be the minimum total that is >=x (to minimize his total, so that more participants can have totals > s) and then maximize the number of participants with total > s.\n\n            How to compute the maximum number of participants that can have total > s?\n\n                We are free to assign the pairs arbitrarily. We want to maximize the count of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j > s, and then assign the remaining (including Vasya) with total <= s (and at least x for Vasya).\n\n            But note: we are fixing Vasya's total to s (which is >=x). Then we want to maximize the number of participants with total > s.\n\n            Steps for worst place:\n\n                Let s0 be the minimum total that is >=x that Vasya can have. But wait, we are free to choose s (any total >=x) and the matching. We want to maximize the rank (i.e., the worst place). \n\n                Actually, we can choose s arbitrarily (as long as s>=x) and then form a matching that maximizes the number of participants with total > s.\n\n                Then, the worst rank for Vasya is: (number of participants with total > s) + (number of participants with total == s) (if we put him last in the block of s) + 1? Actually, no: the rank is (number of participants with total > s) + 1 (minimum) and (number of participants with total >= s) (maximum) if we consider that the block of s is broken arbitrarily and we put him at the end.\n\n                But note: the rank is defined by the entire",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given scores from both tours to find the optimal matching that maximizes and minimizes Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider all possible ways to match participants' scores from the first tour (list `a`) and the second tour (list `b`). Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from both tours. Vasya must have a total score of at least `x`. The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya can achieve, considering all possible matchings and tie-break scenarios.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to maximize his total score. This is achieved by pairing the highest possible scores from both lists. The rank is then determined by the number of participants with higher totals (none in this case) plus one.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize his total score while ensuring it is at least `x`. We then count how many participants can have higher totals than Vasya's chosen total. The worst rank is the count of these higher-scoring participants plus one (accounting for ties).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted in descending order to facilitate efficient calculation of maximum and minimum possible totals.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: Used to efficiently count the number of participants who can score higher than a given value by leveraging the sorted lists.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time. The subsequent steps involve linear scans, each O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space used is O(n) for storing the sorted lists, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    best_rank = 1\n    worst_rank = n\n    \n    # Find the best rank (minimum rank)\n    ptr1 = 0\n    ptr2 = 0\n    count_higher = 0\n    while ptr1 < n and ptr2 < n:\n        s = a_sorted[ptr1] + b_sorted[ptr2]\n        if s > x:\n            count_higher += 1\n            ptr1 += 1\n            ptr2 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    best_rank = count_higher + 1\n    \n    # Find the worst rank (maximum rank)\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    total_needed = x\n    count_higher_worst = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = n-1\n    found = False\n    while i <= j:\n        if a_sorted_asc[i] + b_sorted_asc[j] >= x:\n            count_higher_worst += 1\n            j -= 1\n            found = True\n        else:\n            i += 1\n            \n    if not found:\n        worst_rank = n\n    else:\n        remaining = n - count_higher_worst - 1\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        low_count = 0\n        high_count = 0\n        \n        while i <= j:\n            s = a_sorted_asc[i] + b_sorted_asc[j]\n            if s >= x:\n                high_count += 1\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                low_count += 1\n                i += 1\n                \n        if high_count > 0:\n            worst_rank = count_higher_worst + high_count + 1\n        else:\n            worst_rank = count_higher_worst + 1\n            \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total score `x`, and the scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted in descending order to facilitate the calculation of the best rank and ascending order for the worst rank.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: By using two pointers, we count how many participants can have a total score higher than the maximum possible score Vasya can achieve. The best rank is simply this count plus one.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: Using a two-pointer technique again, we count how many participants can have a total score higher than the minimum required `x`. The worst rank is derived from this count, adjusted for any ties or lower-scoring participants.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and two-pointer techniques to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
