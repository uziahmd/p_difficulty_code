Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players, each making exactly n moves. In each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for first, S2 for second). Then that digit is erased from A.\n\n We want to output a string of 2n characters (each either 'H' or 'M') representing the sequence of moves (who took which digit) that maximizes the total prize (which is the value of S1 + S2? Actually, note: the problem says \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", so the total prize is S1 + S2).\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"maximizes their total prize\" (meaning S1 + S2). But observe: the entire string A is distributed between the two players. Each digit goes to one of the players. The catch: the order of moves is fixed by the sequence of H and M. The first player's number is built from the digits taken by H in the order they were taken, and similarly for M.\n\n But note: the entire process is deterministic once we decide the assignment of each digit (from left to right) to either H or M, with the constraint that there are exactly n H's and n M's.\n\n How do we assign the digits? The total prize is the sum of two numbers: one built from the digits assigned to H (in the order they appear in A) and the other from the digits assigned to M (also in the order of A). However, the assignment is done by taking the leftmost digit at each step, so the first digit goes to the first player who moves in that round.\n\n Let the moves be represented by a string of length 2n, with exactly n 'H' and n 'M'. The i-th digit (0-indexed) of A will go to the player corresponding to the i-th character in the move string.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to compute the total prize, only to output a move sequence that achieves the maximum.\n\n Observation: We are allowed to choose the order of moves arbitrarily (as long as there are n of each). But note: the assignment of digits is fixed by the move sequence: the first digit goes to the first move (whether H or M), the second to the second move, etc.\n\n Therefore, the two numbers are built from the digits in A, but partitioned arbitrarily (with the constraint that the two sets are of size n each) and the order of the digits in each number is the same as in A.\n\n However, note: the problem is that the entire string A is split into two subsequences (each of length n) and the order of appearance in A is preserved. Then the total prize is the numerical value of the first subsequence plus the numerical value of the second subsequence.\n\n But wait: the two numbers are built from the digits taken in the order of the original A. So if we assign a set of positions (index set I for H) and the complement (J for M), then:\n   S1 = the number formed by the digits at indices in I (in increasing index order)\n   S2 = the number formed by the digits at indices in J (in increasing index order)\n\n And we want to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n How can we think about it?\n\n Consider: we have to assign each digit to either H or M. The total prize is the sum of two numbers. The key is that the same digit might be in different places and contribute differently to the overall sum.\n\n However, note: the entire set of digits is fixed. The total sum of all digits is fixed, but wait: the two numbers are built by concatenating the digits in the order of A. Actually, the entire A is being split.\n\n But note: the two numbers are independent, but the digits are fixed. The problem is equivalent to: we must assign each digit to one of two numbers (each number being built by the digits in the order of A) and the two numbers have the same length (n digits). We wish to maximize the sum.\n\n Let's consider the contribution of each digit. The digit at position i (0-indexed) is d_i. In the final numbers, the digit d_i will be placed at a certain power of 10, depending on how many digits remain to its right that are assigned to the same player? Actually, no: the position in the number is determined by the relative order of the digits assigned to that player.\n\n Specifically, if we look at the digits assigned to H, then the digit at position i (if assigned to H) will be placed at the j-th position (from left) in S1, where j is the number of digits from the start of A up to i that are also assigned to H. Similarly for M.\n\n Alternatively,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine a sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized. The sequence should consist of exactly `2n` characters, with `n` 'H's (for Homer) and `n` 'M's (for Marge), arranged in an order that optimizes the total prize.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves splitting a string `A` of length `2n` into two subsequences of length `n` each, where each subsequence represents the digits collected by one player in the order they appear in `A`. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numerical values of these two subsequences.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the largest digits are placed in the highest possible positions (leftmost) for both players. This means that during the first half of the digits, we should prioritize assigning larger digits to one player, and during the second half, to the other player. This approach ensures that the most significant digits contribute maximally to the sum.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can split the problem into two parts:\n   - **First Half Handling**: For the first `n` digits, assign each digit alternately starting with Homer. If a digit is larger than the next one, assign it to Homer; otherwise, assign it to Marge. This ensures that Homer gets the larger digits first.\n   - **Second Half Handling**: For the remaining `n` digits, assign each digit alternately starting with Marge. Similarly, if a digit is larger than the next one, assign it to Marge; otherwise, assign it to Homer. This ensures Marge gets the larger digits in the latter part.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    \n    seq = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i < len(A):\n            if A[i] > A[i+1]:\n                seq.append('H')\n            else:\n                seq.append('M')\n                \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i < len(A):\n            if A[n+i] > A[n+i+1]:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    seq.append('M')\n                else:\n                    seq.append('H')\n            else:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    seq.append('H')\n                else:\n                    seq.append('M')\n                    \n    result = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` and the string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **First Half Processing**: The first loop processes the first `n` digits. For each digit, it checks if it is larger than the next digit. If so, it assigns 'H' (Homer's move); otherwise, it assigns 'M' (Marge's move). This ensures Homer picks up larger digits first.\n3. **Second Half Processing**: The second loop processes the remaining `n` digits. Here, it alternates the starting player (Marge first) and again uses the same comparison to decide who gets the larger digit. This ensures Marge picks up larger digits in the latter half.\n4. **Output**: The sequence of moves is joined into a string and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the total prize by strategically assigning the largest available digits to each player in their respective halves of the sequence, leveraging simple comparisons and alternating assignments.",
