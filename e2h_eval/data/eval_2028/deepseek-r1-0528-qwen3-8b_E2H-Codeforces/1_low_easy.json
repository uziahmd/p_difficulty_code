The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h.\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), then the next 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting at i=1) has width 1 cell and is placed on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n However, note that the ring is defined as the bordering cells of that inner rectangle. But note: the example picture for the third example (which is the second ring) in a 7x9 plate:\n\n Let's break down:\n For the first ring (k=1): \n   The outer rectangle is w x h. The ring is the border of this rectangle. The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is: 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice).\n   Alternatively, we can think: top row: a, bottom row: a, left and right columns without the corners: (b-2) each, so total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n But wait, the problem says: the i-th ring is for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n However, note that the rings are drawn such that the first ring is the outermost, then the next one is 2 cells inwards (so it leaves a 1-cell gap on each side). \n\n Actually, the i-th ring uses a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and then the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, the problem states: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size ...\". \n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3 3 1 -> Output: 8.\n\n For a 3x3 plate and 1 ring:\n   The entire plate is 3x3. The border (perimeter) of a 3x3 rectangle is 3*4 - 4 = 12-4 = 8? Actually, 3x3: top row 3, bottom row 3, left and right columns: each has 3, but the corners are shared. So: top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 3-2 = 1, right: 3-2 = 1 -> 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n Alternatively, using the formula: 2*w + 2*h - 4, for w=3, h=3: 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8.\n\n Now, if we have two rings (k=2) for the same plate? \n   But note: k must satisfy: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). For w=h=3: min(3,3)=3, (3+1)=4, floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed for 3x3.\n\n Example 2: Input: 7 9 1 -> Output: 28.\n   Using the formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 -4 = 32-4=28.\n\n Example 3: Input: 7 9 2 -> Output: 40.\n\n For the second ring (i=2) in a 7x9 plate:\n   The inner rectangle for the second ring is (7 - 4*(2-1)) x (9 - 4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n   Then the second ring is the border of this 3x5 rectangle? But wait, the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\".\n\n How many cells in the border of 3x5? 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n But the output for two rings is 40, which is 28 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) = 40. \n\n Therefore, the approach is:\n   For the i-th ring (from 1 to k):\n        Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple rings. Each ring is placed inward from the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the previous one. The key insight is to recognize that each ring corresponds to the perimeter of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells for each previous ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the number of cells in the border (perimeter) of a rectangle defined by its width and height. The first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Each subsequent ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is smaller by 4 cells in both dimensions (since each ring moves 2 cells inward on each side).\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners. Specifically, the formula is \\(2 \\times (a + b) - 4\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the current width and height of the rectangle.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\), compute the current dimensions by reducing the original width and height by \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\). Then apply the perimeter formula to these dimensions to get the number of cells for that ring. Sum these values across all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(k)\\), which is efficient given the constraints \\(k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\) and \\(w, h \\leq 100\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if current_w <= 0 or current_h <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width \\(w\\), height \\(h\\), and number of rings \\(k\\).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells for all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\):\n   - Calculate the current width and height by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from the original dimensions. This adjustment accounts for moving inward by 2 cells on each side for each previous ring.\n   - Check if the current dimensions are positive; if not, break the loop as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring's perimeter using the formula \\(2 \\times (current\\_w + current\\_h) - 4\\) and add it to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ensures correctness by validating each ring's dimensions before computation.",
