При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to determine if it can be represented as the result of two consecutive identical messages `s` being sent, but with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The entire message t must be the concatenation of two copies of s, but with a non-zero overlap (so the two copies of s are merged by overlapping at the end of the first and the beginning of the second).\n 2. The overlap must be positive and less than the length of s.\n 3. If the entire message is just two copies without any overlap (like \"abcabc\" for s=\"abc\"), then that does not count as an error. So we output \"NO\".\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are looking for a string s such that:\n   t = s + s[overlap:]   where 0 < overlap < len(s)\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire string t must be partitioned into two parts: a prefix and a suffix, which are two copies of s with an overlap.\n\n Another way to think: \n   Let the original message be s, then the transmitted message t is s + s[k:], where k is the overlap (and k >= 1 and k < len(s)).\n\n But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical, so we are sending s twice, and then an error causes the last k characters of the first copy to merge with the first k of the second copy.\n\n Therefore, we have:\n   t = s + s[k:]   and k in [1, len(s)-1]\n\n Also note: the entire string t must be exactly the concatenation of two copies of s with the overlapping part removed from the second copy.\n\n Alternatively, we can express the condition as:\n   There exists an integer k (with 1 <= k < n/2) such that:\n        t[:len(s)-k] == s[:len(s)-k]   and   t[len(s)-k:] == s[k:]\n\n But note: we don't know s. However, we can also note that the entire string t must be built from a base string s, and the length of t must be between 2*len(s) - 1 and ... actually, the length of t is 2*len(s) - overlap, and overlap is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n Actually, let m = len(s). Then the length of t is m + (m - k) = 2*m - k, and k is in [1, m-1]. Therefore, the length of t must be between m+1 and 2*m-1.\n\n Also, note that the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\n Since we don't know s, we can try to consider the possible splits.\n\n Observation:\n   The entire string t must be periodic. In fact, we can consider that the string t must have a period p, and the length of t must be at least 2*p - p_overlap, but we can also use the idea of borders (like in the prefix function) or simply iterate over possible split points.\n\n Alternatively, note that the two copies of s must satisfy:\n   t = s + s[k:]   => t[0:m] = s, and t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n But wait, what if the two copies are not aligned at the middle? Actually, the two copies are consecutive, so the entire string is built from two copies of s, but the second copy is cut by the overlap.\n\n Actually, we can also note that the entire string t must be such that the last part of the first copy matches the beginning of the second copy. \n\n Another approach: \n   Let n = len(t)\n   We suspect that there is an overlap k (which is the same as saying the first copy is s and the second copy is s with the first k characters already present at the end of the first copy).\n\n   Then, the entire string t can be broken into two parts: \n        t = A + B, where A is the first copy (which is s) and B is the rest of the second copy (without the overlapping part). But note, the overlapping part is the last k of A and the first k of B must match.\n\n   However, note the merging: the two copies are s and s, and they are merged by overlapping the last k of the first s with the first k of the second s. So the resulting string is:\n        t = s[0: m-k] + s[m-k: ] + s[k:]   ??? \n\n   Actually, if we break the second s into two parts: the first k characters (which are the same as the last k of the first s) and the remaining part, then the merged string is:\n        t = s + s[k:]   but wait, that doesn't account for the overlapping part being merged. Actually, the entire string t is built by writing the first s, and then the second s without the first k characters. However, note that the condition is that the two messages are identical, so the second copy is s. But the error merges the last k of the first and the first k of the second. So we effectively have:\n\n        t = s[0: m-k] + s   [because the last k of s is merged with the first k of the next s, so we don't write the first k of the next s again?]\n\n   Actually, let me clarify with an example:\n\n   Example 1: s = \"abrakadabra\", and if the overlap k=1, then the merged string is:\n        First copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second copy: \"abrakadabra\" but we only write the part that is not overlapped, i.e., from index 1 to the end. So we get:\n        t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n   But wait, the example output says: \n        Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' -> Output: YES and s = \"abrakadabra\"\n\n   How about if we break t into two parts: \n        Let m = len(s) = 11, then the entire string t has length 21 = 11 + 10, which is 2*11 - 1.\n\n   In general, the length of t is m + (m - k) = 2*m - k, and k is from 1 to m-1.\n\n   Now, how to check?\n\n   We can try to find an integer k (the overlap) such that:\n        Condition 1: k is in [1, m-1] (but m is unknown, and note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the length of t must be at least m+1 and at most 2*m-1. Also, m must be greater than k, so m >= k+1, and the length of t is 2*m - k, so m = (n+k)/2. But note: we don't know k.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string t must be built from two copies of s, so we can try to split t into two parts: the first part is the first copy (which is s) and the second part is the rest of the second copy. But note the merging: the two copies are identical, but the second copy's beginning part (of length k) is merged with the end of the first.\n\n   We can also use the following:\n\n   Let n = len(t). Then, the length of s must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1. Why? Because n = 2*m - k, and k>=1, so m <= n-1. And since k<=m-1, then n = 2*m - k >= 2*m - (m-1) = m+1, so m <= n-1. Also, since k>=1, then n = 2*m - k <= 2*m - 1, so m >= ceil((n+1)/2) ?\n\n   Actually, from n = 2*m - k and 1<=k<=m-1, we have:\n        m = (n + k) / 2, so n must be odd or even? Actually, no restriction.\n\n   But we can iterate over possible m (length of s) and k. However, note that the length of t is fixed, and we have n = 2*m - k.\n\n   Therefore, for a fixed m (with m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1), we must have that k = 2*m - n, and k must be in [1, m-1]. Then we can check:\n\n        Condition 1: k = 2*m - n, and 1<=k<=m-1.\n\n        Condition 2: The string t should equal s + s[k:], but we don't know s. However, note that s must be the first m characters of t? \n\n        Actually, if we assume that the first copy is the first m characters, then the second copy (without the first k) is t[m:]. But wait, the entire string t is built by the first copy (s) and then the second copy without the first k, so the second copy is s, and the part from m to the end is s[k:].\n\n        Therefore, we can set:\n            s = t[0:m]\n            and we require that t[m:] == s[k:]\n\n        But note: the length of t[m:] is n - m, and the length of s[k:] is m - k. So we require n - m = m - k  => k = 2*m - n, which we already used.\n\n   Therefore, the steps are:\n\n   For a candidate m (from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1) such that k = 2*m - n is an integer in [1, m-1], then:\n        Check if t[m:] == t[k:m]   (because s[k:] is the substring from index k to the end of s, and s is t[0:m])\n\n   But note: we can also consider that the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so we can also look for a period.\n\n   However, there might be multiple m? But note: the condition defines k uniquely from m and n: k = 2*m - n.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Read the string t.\n\n   Step 2: Let n = len(t)\n\n   Step 3: We consider possible m (the length of s) such that:\n        m_min = ceil((n+1)/2)  -> actually, from the equation: n = 2*m - k, and k>=1 => m <= n-1, and k<=m-1 => n = 2*m - k >= 2*m - (m-1) = m+1 => m <= n-1, and also from n = 2*m - k, we have m = (n + k) / 2, and k>=1 so m >= (n+1)/2. But note: m must be an integer.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate m from max(ceil((n+1)/2), floor((n+1)/2)) to n-1, but actually:\n\n        Let m_min = (n+1)//2 + (if n is odd, then (n+1)//2 is integer, but if even then we need to take ceiling? Actually, from n = 2*m - k, and k>=1, so 2*m >= n+1 => m >= ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        For example, n=5: m_min = ceil(6/2)=3. Then k=2*3-5=1, which is valid.\n\n        Then for each m from m_min to n-1, compute k = 2*m - n.\n\n        Conditions for k: k must be an integer in [1, m-1]. Since m and n are integers, k is integer.\n\n        Then, we check if t[m:] == t[k:m] (because s = t[0:m], and the second part is s[k:], which is t[k:m]).\n\n        But note: the second part of t is from index m to the end, and the length of this part is n-m. The length of s[k:] is m-k, and we have n-m = m-k (because n=2*m-k). So the lengths match.\n\n   Step 4: If we find at least one m for which the condition holds, then we can say \"YES\" and output s = t[0:m].\n\n   However, note: the problem says that if there are multiple, we can output any.\n\n   But what if there are multiple m? Then we can choose the smallest one? Or the largest one? Actually, the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Example: t = \"abababab\", n=8.\n\n   Possibilities for m:\n\n        m_min = ceil(9/2)=5 (since (8+1)=9, ceil(9/2)=5)\n\n        m from 5 to 7.\n\n        For m=5: k=2*5-8=2. Then check: t[5:] = \"abab\", and t[2:5] = \"bab\". These are not equal -> fail.\n\n        For m=6: k=2*6-8=4. Then t[6:] = \"ab\", and t[4:6]=\"ab\". They are equal. So s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\".\n\n        For m=7: k=2*7-8=6. Then t[7:] = \"b\", and t[6:7]=\"b\". They are equal. So s = t[0:7] = \"abababa\".\n\n        Both are valid. But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical and the merging is by overlapping. However, the problem also says that the entire message t must be the result of two identical messages. \n\n        But note: the two copies are both s. So if we use s = \"ababab\", then the two copies are \"ababab\" and \"ababab\", and with an overlap of 4, we get:\n            First copy: \"ababab\"\n            Second copy: we remove the first 4, so we get \"ab\", so the total string is \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is correct.\n\n        Similarly, if we use s = \"abababa\", then the two copies are \"abababa\" and \"abababa\", with an overlap of 6, we get:\n            First copy: \"abababa\"\n            Second copy: remove the first 6, so we get \"a\", so the total string is \"abababa\" + \"a\" = \"abababaaa\"? Wait, that would be \"abababa\" + \"a\" = \"abababaa\", which is not the same as \"abababab\".\n\n        Let me recalc: \n            s = \"abababa\", then the second copy without the first 6 characters: \n                s = \"abababa\", so the first 6 characters are \"ababab\", so the remaining part is \"a\", so the total string is \"abababa\" + \"a\" = \"abababa\" + \"a\" = \"abababaa\", but the input is \"abababab\", which is 8 characters. \n\n        Wait, so that doesn't match. \n\n        Actually, the length condition: n = 2*m - k, for m=7 and k=6: n=2*7-6=8, which matches. But then the second part is s[k:] = s[6:7] = \"a\", so the entire string is s + s[k:] = \"abababa\" + \"a\" = \"abababaa\", which is 8 characters. However, the input is \"abababab\", which is different.\n\n        So why did we check t[7:]==\"b\" and t[6:7]==\"b\"? \n\n        Correction: \n            For m=7, the first copy is t[0:7] = \"abababa\"\n            Then the second part is t[7:] which is the last character: 'b' (since n=8, so t[7] is the 8th character, which is 'b').\n            And s[k:] = t[6:7] (because s is t[0:7]) and k=6, so t[6:7] is the 7th character of t (which is the 7th index, 0-indexed) which is 'a'? \n\n        Let me index the string \"abababab\":\n            indices: 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b, 6:a, 7:b\n\n        So for m=7: \n            t[0:7] = \"abababa\" (indices 0 to 6)\n            Then the rest is t[7] = 'b'\n\n        Now, s[k:] with k=6: from index 6 to the end of s (which is 7 exclusive) so from index6 to index7 (exclusive) is just one character: the 6th index, which is 'a'. \n\n        So we require that t[7:] (which is 'b') equals s[6:] (which is 'a') -> fails.\n\n        I made a mistake in the indexing: the substring s[k:] is taken from the string s (which is t[0:m]), so for m=7, s is \"abababa\", and k=6, then s[6:] is the substring starting at index6 (0-indexed) and going until the end of s (index7, so one character: the 6th character of s, which is the 7th character of the original string? No, because s is the first 7 characters, so the 6th index of s is the 6th character of the original string (which is 'a').\n\n        Therefore, the condition for m=7 is: t[7:] should be 'b', and s[6:] is 'a', so they are not equal.\n\n        Then why did I say t[7:]==\"b\" and t[6:7]==\"b\"? That was a mistake. The condition is: we are comparing t[m:] (which is from index m to the end) with s[k:] (which is from index k to the end of s). \n\n        So the code condition is: t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        But wait, we defined s = t[0:m], so s[k:] is t[k:m] (because s is t[0:m]). \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        Now, for m=7: \n            t[m:] = t[7:] = t[7:8] = 'b'\n            t[k:m] = t[6:7] = 'a'\n\n        So they are not equal.\n\n        So the example t=\"abababab\" has only one solution: m=6, s=\"ababab\".\n\n   However, note: the example output for the input ['abababab'] is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\n   But wait, the example input also includes 'acacacaca' and the output is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n   Let's check 'acacacaca' (n=9):\n\n        m_min = ceil((9+1)/2)=5\n\n        m from 5 to 8.\n\n        m=5: k=2*5-9=1 -> condition: t[5:]=='cacaca' and t[1:5]=='cac'? \n            t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n            t[5:] = \"caca\"\n            t[1:5] = \"cac\" -> wait, t[1:5] is from index1 to index4 (exclusive) -> \"cac\" (because: t[1]='c', t[2]='a', t[3]='c', t[4]='a') -> \"caca\" vs \"cac\" -> not the same.\n\n        m=6: k=2*6-9=3 -> condition: t[6:]=='aca', and t[3:6]=='aca' (t[3:6]: index3='c', index4='a', index5='c' -> \"cac\", so not \"aca\")\n\n        m=7: k=2*7-9=5 -> condition: t[7:]=='ca', and t[5:7]=='ca' -> yes. \n            Then s = t[0:7] = \"acacaca\", and the second part is t[7:]=='ca', and s[5:7]=='ca'. So it matches.\n\n        But the example output is 'acaca'. \n\n        Why is \"acacaca\" not acceptable? \n\n        Note: the problem says: \"If there are multiple answers, output any.\"\n\n        However, note the condition: the two copies are identical. The example output uses s=\"acaca\", so let's check with s=\"acaca\" (length=5):\n\n            Then the entire string should be: \n                s + s[k:] with k=2*5-9 -> wait, but we have n=9, so for s of length 5: n=9 = 2*5 - k => k=1.\n            Then the merged string is s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is the input.\n\n            So both m=5 and m=7 are valid? \n\n        Let me check m=5 again: \n            Condition: k=1, then we require t[5:] = s[1:], and s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\", then s[1:] = \"caca\", and t[5:] = \"caca\" (from index5 to the end: \"caca\"). So they match.\n\n        So actually, for m=5: \n            t[5:] = \"caca\"\n            t[1:5] = \"caca\" -> wait, no: t[1:5] is from index1 to index5 (exclusive) of the original string, which is the substring from index1 to index4 (inclusive). The original string is \"acacacaca\":\n\n            Indexes: \n                0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c, 6:a, 7:c, 8:a\n\n            t[0:5] = \"acaca\" (indices0 to4)\n            t[5:] = \"caca\" (indices5 to8)\n\n            Now, s[1:5] is the substring of s (which is \"acaca\") from index1 to5 (exclusive) -> that is \"caca\", which equals t[5:].\n\n            So m=5 is valid.\n\n        Then why the example output is \"acaca\" (which is s of length5) and not \"acacaca\" (length7)? \n\n        The problem says: output any. But the example output is \"acaca\".\n\n        However, note: the example input was given as:\n\n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So the second example outputs 'acaca', which is the shorter one.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n            \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca\"\n\n        So the note says that both \"acaca\" and \"acacaca\" are valid.\n\n        However, our algorithm found two solutions. How do we choose? \n\n        The problem says: output any. So we can choose the smallest one? Or the largest one? \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify, so we can output any.\n\n        However, we must ensure that we are not missing a condition. \n\n        Let me check the condition for m=5 and m=7 in the example \"acacacaca\":\n\n            For m=5: \n                s = \"acaca\", and the two copies are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\", with overlap k=1, so the merged string is \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\".\n\n            For m=7:\n                s = \"acacaca\", and the two copies are \"acacaca\" and \"acacaca\", with overlap k=5, so the merged string is \"acacaca\" + \"aca\" (because we skip the first 5 of the second copy) = \"acacacaca\".\n\n        So both are valid.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So the original message s is the same for both copies.\n\n        However, the problem also says that the length of the string t is at most 100, so we can iterate over all possible m.\n\n        How to choose? \n\n        The problem does not specify, so we can choose the smallest s (i.e., the smallest m) or the largest. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"output any\". \n\n        However, the example output chose the smallest (because \"acaca\" is shorter than \"acacaca\").\n\n        So we can modify: iterate m from m_min to n-1, and then output the first s we find (which would be the smallest m) or the last? \n\n        But wait: the example \"abababab\": \n            m_min = 5, then m=5: invalid, m=6: valid -> output s of length6.\n\n        But note: the example output is \"ababab\", which is the first valid one (m=6). \n\n        However, note: the example input also includes \"tatbt\", which is invalid.\n\n        Another example: \"abcabc\" -> n=6.\n\n        m_min = ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(7/2)=4 (since 7//2=3.5 -> ceil=4)\n\n        Then m from 4 to 5.\n\n        m=4: k=2*4-6=2. Then check: t[4:]==\"bc\", and t[2:4]==\"bc\" -> yes, because t[2:4] is \"bc\". Then s = t[0:4]=\"abca\", and the two copies would be \"abca\" and \"abca\", with overlap 2: \n            First copy: \"abca\"\n            Second copy: skip first 2, so we get \"ca\", so the total string is \"abca\"+\"ca\" = \"abcaca\", but the input is \"abcabc\". \n\n        Wait, that doesn't match. \n\n        Let me check the condition: \n            t[4:] should be \"bc\", and t[2:4] is \"bc\" (from t=\"abcabc\": \n                t[0]='a', t[1]='b', t[2]='c', t[3]='a', t[4]='b', t[5]='c'\n                t[2:4] is \"ca\"? -> no, wait:\n\n            Actually, the string \"abcabc\": \n                indices: 0:a,1:b,2:c,3:a,4:b,5:c\n                t[4:] is from index4 to the end: \"bc\"\n                t[2:4] is from index2 to index4 (exclusive): so [2,3] -> 'c' and 'a' -> \"ca\"\n\n            So they are not equal.\n\n        Then m=4 fails.\n\n        m=5: k=2*5-6=4. Then check: t[5:]==\"c\", and t[4:5]==\"b\" -> not equal.\n\n        So no solution -> output \"NO\", which matches the example.\n\n        But wait, why did we get m=4? \n\n        The condition for m=4: \n            s = t[0:4] = \"abca\"\n            Then the second part is t[4:] = \"bc\", and we require that t[4:] == s[2:4] (because k=2, so s[2:4] is from index2 to4 of s, which is \"ca\"). \n\n        So the condition is not met.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        n = len(t)\n\n        Let m_min = (n+1)//2   [ceiling division: (n+1)//2 gives the ceiling of (n+1)/2? Actually, for integer n, (n+1)//2 is the ceiling of n/2? Not exactly: \n            We need m_min = ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        Actually, we have: m_min = (n+1 + 1) // 2? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set m_min = (n+1)//2 + (1 if (n+1)%2 !=0 else 0) -> but simpler: we know that m_min is the smallest integer m such that 2*m - (m-1) <= n, but actually we have m_min = ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        We can compute: m_min = (n+1) // 2 + (0 if (n+1) % 2 == 0 else 0) -> no, better: \n\n        Actually, from the equation: n = 2*m - k, with k>=1 and k<=m-1, so m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        How to compute ceil((n+1)/2) for integer n?\n\n            If n is even: (n+1)//2 = n//2 + 0.5 -> but integer division in Python: (n+1)//2 is floor((n+1)/2). \n\n        Example: n=5 -> (5+1)//2 = 6//2=3 -> ceil(6/2)=3, which is correct.\n                 n=4 -> (4+1)//2=5//2=2 -> ceil(5/2)=3, but wait: \n                    For n=4, we require m_min = ceil((4+1)/2)=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n        So we want: m_min = (n+1) // 2 if (n+1) % 2 == 0? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set m_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0) -> no, that would be the same as (n+1)//2 for even n+1, and (n+2)//2 for odd n+1? \n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            m_min = (n+1) // 2   # This is floor division. For n=5: (5+1)//2=3, for n=4: (4+1)//2=2, but we need 3 for n=4.\n\n        The condition is: m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        We can compute: \n            m_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 == 1 else 0) -> but wait, for n=4: (4+1)=5, 5%2==1 -> then m_min = 5//2 + 1 = 2+1=3 -> correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            m_min = (n+1) // 2 + ((n+1) % 2 > 0 ? 1 : 0) -> but in Python, we can do:\n\n            m_min = (n+1 + 1) // 2   # This is the same as (n+2)//2, which is the ceiling of (n+1)/2.\n\n        Actually, the ceiling of (n+1)/2 is (n+1+1)//2 when using integer floor division for positive numbers? \n\n        We know: \n            ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, for positive integers.\n\n        Here, we want ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1 + 2-1) // 2 = (n+2)//2.\n\n        Example: n=4 -> (4+2)//2=6//2=3, n=5-> (5+2)//2=7//2=3 (in integer floor division) -> but wait, 7//2 is 3 (floor) but ceil(7/2)=4? \n\n        Actually, we are computing ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        Let me check: \n            For n=4: ceil((4+1)/2)=ceil(5/2)=3 -> (4+2)//2=3 -> correct.\n            For n=5: ceil(6/2)=3 -> (5+2)//2=7//2=3 -> correct.\n\n        So yes, m_min = (n+2)//2.\n\n        Then, iterate m from m_min to n-1.\n\n        For each m:\n            k = 2*m - n\n            if k < 1 or k >= m: continue   (because k must be in [1, m-1])\n            Then, check if t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        If we find one, output \"YES\" and the string s = t[0:m]\n\n        But note: the problem says that if the entire message is just two copies without any overlap, then that is not considered an error. \n\n        In our method, we require that the overlap k is at least 1 and at most m-1, so we are excluding the case when k=0 (which would be no overlap) and k=m (which is the whole copy) is excluded because k>=m is not allowed (since k<=m-1). \n\n        However, note: the condition for the error requires that the two messages are identical and the merging occurs (so k>=1). \n\n        But note: the problem also says that if the entire message is just two copies without any overlap, then output \"NO\". Our method does not consider k=0 because we require k>=1.\n\n        However, what if the entire message is two copies without any overlap? Then we would not consider it because k=0 is not allowed. \n\n        But wait, in our iteration, we start from m_min and go to n-1. The condition for two copies without overlap is that the entire string is two copies of s, so n=2*m, and then k=0, but we don't allow k=0. \n\n        However, note: the condition for two copies without overlap is that the entire string is s+s, so n=2*m, then k=2*m-n=0, and we skip because k<1.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But wait: the example \"abcabc\": \n            n=6, m_min=(6+2)//2=4, then m from 4 to 5.\n            m=4: k=2*4-6=2 -> check: t[4:]==\"bc\", and t[2:4]==\"ca\" -> not equal.\n            m=5: k=2*5-6=4 -> check: t[5:]==\"\"? Actually, t[5:] is from index5 to the end (empty) and t[4:5]==\"b\" (if the string is \"abcabc\") -> not equal.\n\n        So we output \"NO\".\n\n        Another example: \"aaa\" (n=3)\n\n            m_min = (3+2)//2 = 5//2=2 (floor division)\n\n            m from 2 to 2 (since n-1=2)\n\n            k=2*2-3=1 -> valid (1 in [1,1])\n            Check: t[2:]=\"\" (empty string) and t[1:2] = \"a\" (if the string is \"aaa\": \n                s = t[0:2]=\"aa\"\n                Then the second part should be s[1:]=\"a\", and t[2:] is empty -> not equal.\n\n            So output \"NO\", but wait, is \"aaa\" the result of two copies of \"a\" with an overlap of 1?\n\n            Two copies of \"a\": \n                First copy: \"a\"\n                Second copy: remove the first 1 character, so we get nothing, so the entire string is \"a\" (first copy) and then nothing? \n\n            Actually, the entire string is built as: s + s[1:] = \"a\" + \"\" = \"a\", but the input is \"aaa\", so that doesn't match.\n\n            Alternatively, if we consider s=\"aa\", then the two copies are \"aa\" and \"aa\", with overlap k=1: \n                First copy: \"aa\"\n                Second copy: skip the first 1, so we get \"a\", so the entire string is \"aa\"+\"a\"=\"aaa\". \n\n            So s=\"aa\" is valid.\n\n            What went wrong in the check?\n\n            We set s = t[0:2] = \"aa\", then the second part is t[2:] which is the substring from index2 to the end, which is \"a\" (because the string \"aaa\" has indexes 0,1,2: so t[2] is the third character, which is 'a'). \n\n            But wait, the condition is: t[m:] == s[k:]\n\n            Here, m=2, so t[2:] is the substring from index2 (inclusive) to the end. In \"aaa\", the substring from index2 to the end is \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with a non-zero overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first `s` merges with the beginning of the second `s` by matching characters, and the merged string must exactly match `t`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking two copies of a string `s` and merging them with a positive overlap. The merged string should not be simply the concatenation of two identical strings without any overlap.\n2. **Insight**: For a string `t` of length `n`, the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `m`) must satisfy the condition that `n = 2*m - k`, where `k` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < m). This translates to `m` being in the range `(n+2)//2` to `n-1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible values of `m` (length of `s`). For each `m`, compute the overlap `k = 2*m - n`. If `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k < m), check if the substring of `t` starting at index `m` matches the substring of `s` starting at index `k` (i.e., `t[m:] == t[k:m]`). If such an `m` is found, `s` is `t[0:m]`; otherwise, it's impossible, and we return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n <= 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    m_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    found = False\n    s_found = None\n    \n    for m in range(m_min, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= m:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[m:] == t[k:m]:\n            found = True\n            s_found = t[:m]\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_found)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, it's impossible to form the required merged string, so \"NO\" is printed.\n3. **Finding Valid `s`**: The algorithm calculates the minimum possible length `m` of `s` using `(n + 2) // 2`. It then checks each possible `m` from `m_min` to `n-1`.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each `m`, the overlap `k` is calculated. If `k` is valid (1 ≤ k < m), the algorithm checks if the substring of `t` starting at `m` matches the substring of `s` (first `m` characters of `t`) starting at `k`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, \"YES\" followed by `s` is printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed indicating no valid `s` exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical strings with a positive overlap, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
