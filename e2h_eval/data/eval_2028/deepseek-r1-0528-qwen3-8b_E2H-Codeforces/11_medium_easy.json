A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast per friend: \n   - Each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\n However, note that the entire group makes toasts together, but each friend must have the same amount.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: total_drink = k * l (milliliters)\n 2. Calculate the total number of lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n 3. The salt is available as p grams.\n\n Now, to make one toast (which is for one friend) we require:\n    - nl milliliters of drink\n    - 1 slice of lime\n    - np grams of salt\n\n But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n However, the friends are making the same number of toasts per person. So if they are making t toasts per friend, then:\n\n    Total drink needed = t * n * nl   (because each of the n friends has t toasts, and each toast requires nl ml)\n    Total lime slices needed = t * n   (each toast requires one slice, and there are n*t toasts)\n    Total salt needed = t * n * np\n\n But wait, the example calculation in the note is different: they compute the maximum toasts from each resource independently and then divide by the number of friends.\n\n Actually, the example does:\n\n    Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (toasts) = 6 (total toasts for all friends) -> then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2 per friend.\n\n However, note that the example doesn't break down by per friend first. They consider the entire group's requirement for one toast: \n\n    For one toast (for one friend) we need nl ml and np grams and one slice. But if we are making multiple toasts, then the entire group's toast count is the same for each.\n\n Let me restate: \n    Let T be the total number of toasts (across all friends). Then the requirements are:\n        Drink: T * nl <= k * l\n        Lime: T <= c * d   (because each toast requires one slice, and we have c*d slices)\n        Salt: T * np <= p\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. \n This implies that for one toast, one friend uses nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\n So if we let T be the total number of toasts (each toast is for one friend), then we have:\n\n        T <= (k * l) / nl   [from drink]\n        T <= c * d          [from lime: because each toast requires one slice, and we have c*d slices]\n        T <= p / np         [from salt]\n\n But note: the entire group's toasts are T, and since there are n friends, each friend can have T/n toasts? \n\n Wait, actually the problem states: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\", meaning that one toast is for one friend. \n Therefore, if we want each friend to have the same number of toasts, say t, then the total toasts T = t * n.\n\n Then the constraints become:\n\n        t * n * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n        t * n <= c * d        => t <= (c * d) / n\n        t * n * np <= p       => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, note the example input: \n        Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n        Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n According to the above, we would compute:\n\n        Drink: t <= (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so t_max1 = 2\n        Lime: t <= (10*8) / 3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> so t_max2 = 26\n        Salt: t <= 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> so t_max3 = 33\n\n Then t = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n But wait, the example note does:\n\n        Overall the friends have 20 ml -> enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts (this is total toasts, not per friend).\n        Then they say the answer is min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n In the example, they are computing:\n\n        Total toasts (for the entire group) cannot exceed:\n            From drink: 20 / 3 = 6 (because 3 friends each toast requires 3 ml? Actually, wait: the example says \"nl=3\", so each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. Then for 6 toasts, the drink used is 6*3 = 18 ml, which is <=20. So 6 is the maximum total toasts.\n\n        Similarly, lime: 80 toasts (each toast requires one slice, so 80 slices can do 80 toasts) and salt: 100 toasts.\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink: 6 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Since there are 3 friends, each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n Therefore, the two approaches are equivalent:\n\n        Approach 1: \n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   [but note: we are using integer division or floor? However, the problem says positive integers and we need to use integer toasts? The problem output is an integer.]\n\n        But wait: the example does not use integer division for the drink and salt? Actually, the example uses:\n\n            Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> they took floor? Actually, no: they said 20/3 = 6 toasts (floor division). But note: you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify whether the toasts are fractional. The example calculation is:\n\n            They computed 20 / 3 = 6 (so floor) for the drink.\n\n        But look at the salt: 100 / 1 = 100, which is exact.\n\n        So we should use integer floor division? Actually, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so if we don't have enough for an entire toast, we can't use it.\n\n        Therefore, we compute:\n\n            total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl   ? Not exactly: because the entire group's toast count is the total toasts (each toast for one friend). But wait, the drink requirement for one toast is nl, so the maximum total toasts (for the entire group) from drink is (k*l) // nl? \n\n        However, note: the drink requirement is per toast (one toast for one friend). So the entire group's total toasts (T) must satisfy T * nl <= k*l.\n\n        But the example: \n            T * 3 <= 20 -> T <= 20/3 -> T_max = floor(20/3)=6.\n\n        Similarly, for salt: T * 1 <= 100 -> T <= 100, so T_max_salt = 100.\n\n        And lime: T <= 80.\n\n        Then the maximum total toasts T is min(6,80,100)=6.\n\n        Then each friend gets T / n = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n            Each friend can make t toasts, so the entire group makes n*t toasts.\n\n            Constraints:\n                n*t * nl <= k*l   => t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)   [using real numbers, then take floor?]\n\n            But wait: if we use the entire group's total toasts, we are already accounting for the fact that one toast is for one friend.\n\n        There are two ways:\n\n        Option 1 (as in the example):\n            Step 1: Compute the maximum total toasts (for the entire group) from each resource:\n                total_toasts_drink = (k * l) // nl   -> but wait, this is the total toasts from drink? Actually, no: because the drink requirement is nl per toast, so the total toasts from drink is (k*l) // nl? \n\n            However, note: the drink requirement for one toast is nl, so the maximum number of toasts (across the entire group) that can be made from the drink is (k*l) // nl? \n\n            But wait, if we have 20 ml and each toast requires 3 ml, then we can make 20//3 = 6 toasts (because 6*3=18<=20, and 7*3=21>20). \n\n            Similarly, for lime: each toast requires 1 slice, so the total toasts from lime is c*d (because we have c*d slices, and each toast uses one).\n\n            For salt: (p) // np   (each toast requires np grams, so total toasts from salt is p // np).\n\n            Then the total toasts T = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n\n            Then the number of toasts per friend = T // n   ??? \n\n            But wait: T is the total toasts, and there are n friends. However, note: T might not be divisible by n. But the problem says they all drink the same amount. \n\n            However, the example: n=3, T=6, 6//3=2.\n\n            But what if T=7 and n=3? Then 7//3=2 (if we use integer floor division). However, we cannot have fractional toasts. And also, the entire group must have the same number. \n\n            Actually, the condition is: the total toasts must be such that when divided by n (the number of friends) we get an integer? \n\n            Let me read the problem: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\". This means that each friend must have an integer number of toasts. Therefore, the total toasts must be divisible by n? \n\n            But note: the example does not require the total toasts to be divisible by n, because they are dividing the total toasts by n and taking the floor? \n\n            Actually, the example calculation: \n                They found that the total toasts is 6, then each friend gets 6/3=2.\n\n            However, if the total toasts were 7, then we could only give 2 toasts per friend to all (since 2*3=6, and the 7th toast would leave one friend with 3 and others with 2, which isn't the same). \n\n            But wait, the problem says: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount\".\n\n            So we are looking for the maximum integer t (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n                n*t * nl <= k*l\n                n*t <= c*d\n                n*t * np <= p\n\n            Then t is the minimum value of:\n\n                t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                t <= (c*d) / n\n                t <= p / (n*np)\n\n            Then we take the floor of these values? Actually, t must be an integer and we are looking for the maximum t that satisfies all.\n\n            So:\n\n                t1 = (k*l) // (n*nl)   [but wait: if we do integer floor division, then we are getting the floor of (k*l)/(n*nl). However, we can also use:]\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                t_max_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   -> but wait, is that correct? \n\n            Example: n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3: \n                (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n            But note: the drink constraint is n*t*nl <= k*l -> 3*t*3 <= 20 -> 9t <=20 -> t <= 20/9 -> t_max=2.\n\n            Similarly, for lime: n*t <= c*d -> 3*t <= 10*8=80 -> t <= 80/3 -> t_max=26 (if we use integer floor: 80//3=26)\n\n            For salt: n*t*np <= p -> 3*t*1 <=100 -> t <= 100/3 -> t_max=33 (floor: 100//3=33)\n\n            Then t = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        However, wait: what if we do the total toasts way?\n\n            Total toasts T = n * t.\n\n            Then the constraints become:\n\n                T * nl <= k*l\n                T <= c*d\n                T * np <= p\n\n            Then T_max_drink = (k*l) // nl   (if we use floor division) -> 20//3=6\n            T_max_lime = c*d = 80\n            T_max_salt = p // np = 100 // 1 = 100\n\n            Then T = min(6,80,100)=6.\n\n            Then t = T / n = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n            But note: T must be an integer and divisible by n? Actually, no: the problem does not require T to be divisible by n? It requires each friend to have the same integer number of toasts. \n\n            However, if we use the total toasts method, then we are requiring T to be an integer and we are going to assign T_i to each friend (with T_i being the same integer). Then the condition is that T must be divisible by n? \n\n            Actually, no: we can have T not divisible by n, but then we cannot assign the same integer number of toasts to each. \n\n            But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs ... for one toast\", meaning that we can only assign whole toasts. Therefore, the total toasts must be a multiple of n? \n\n            Let me clarify: we are making toasts and each toast is for one friend. So if we have 7 toasts and 3 friends, we cannot assign 7/3 toasts per friend (which is about 2.33). We can assign 2 toasts to two friends and 3 to the third? But the problem says \"provided they all drink the same amount\", so that is not allowed.\n\n            Therefore, the total toasts T must be divisible by n? Actually, no: we can have T not divisible by n, but then we cannot assign the same integer number of toasts to each. \n\n            Actually, we are looking for the maximum integer t (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n                n*t <= T_total   [where T_total is the maximum total toasts we can have from all resources?] \n\n            But wait, the constraints are:\n\n                n*t * nl <= k*l   -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                n*t <= c*d        -> t <= (c*d) / n\n                n*t * np <= p     -> t <= p / (n*np)\n\n            And we are taking the minimum of the three real number divisions and then taking the floor? Actually, t must be an integer and we are looking for the maximum integer t that satisfies all.\n\n            So we can compute:\n\n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            But wait, is that correct for the drink and salt? \n\n            Example for drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) is 20//9=2, which is correct.\n\n            Example for lime: (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26 (in integer floor division) -> but 3*26 = 78 <=80, and 3*27=81>80, so 26 is the maximum t from lime.\n\n            Example for salt: p // (n*np) = 100 // (3*1)= 100//3=33, and 3*33=99<=100, and 3*34=102>100, so 33 is the maximum t from salt.\n\n            Then t = 2.\n\n            But wait, is floor division the correct operation for the drink and salt? \n\n            The drink constraint: n*t*nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). The maximum integer t is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)).\n\n            Similarly for salt: t <= p/(n*np) -> maximum integer t is floor(p/(n*np)).\n\n            However, for the lime: we have n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d)/n -> maximum integer t is floor((c*d)/n) ?\n\n            Actually, no: we can have fractional t? But t must be integer. The condition is n*t <= c*d. The maximum integer t is floor((c*d)/n) because if we set t = floor((c*d)/n), then n*t <= c*d, and if we set t = floor((c*d)/n)+1 then n*t = n*(floor((c*d)/n)+1) = n*floor((c*d)/n) + n, which might be greater than c*d.\n\n            But wait, is floor((c*d)/n) the maximum integer t? \n\n            Example: c*d=80, n=3 -> 80/3≈26.66, then floor(26.66)=26, and 3*26=78<=80. If we try t=27, then 3*27=81>80 -> not allowed.\n\n            So yes, we use floor division for all.\n\n        However, note: the example does the total toasts (T) method and then divides by n (and uses integer division). That is equivalent to:\n\n            T = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   # but wait, for drink: (k*l)//nl is floor division, and for salt: p//np is floor division, and for lime: c*d is exact.\n\n            Then t = T // n   (using integer floor division) -> 6//3=2.\n\n            But wait, is T//n the same as min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n ?\n\n            Example: \n                Using the per-friend constraints: \n                    t1 = (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // 9 = 2\n                    t2 = (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26\n                    t3 = p // (n*np) = 100 // 3 = 33\n                    t = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n                Using the total toasts:\n                    T_drink = (k*l) // nl = 20 // 3 = 6\n                    T_lime = c*d = 80\n                    T_salt = p // np = 100 // 1 = 100\n                    T = min(6,80,100)=6\n                    t = T // n = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n            Are these two methods equivalent?\n\n            In general, they are not. Consider a different example:\n\n            Example 2: Input \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n            According to the example output: 3.\n\n            Let me break it down:\n\n            Variables: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            Per-friend constraints:\n\n                Drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) = (1000) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n                Lime: (c*d) // n = (1*19) // 5 = 19//5 = 3 (because 5*3=15<=19, and 5*4=20>19)\n                Salt: p // (n*np) = 90 // (5*3) = 90//15=6\n\n                Then t = min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n            Now the total toasts method:\n\n                Total toasts from drink: (k*l)//nl = 1000//4=250\n                Total toasts from lime: c*d=19\n                Total toasts from salt: p//np=90//3=30\n\n                Then T = min(250,19,30)=19\n                Then t = T // n = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 5*3=15<=19, and 5*4=20>19 -> so 3 is the maximum t per friend)\n\n            So both methods yield 3.\n\n            Why? Because in the total toasts method, we are effectively computing:\n\n                T = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n\n                and then t = T // n   (using integer floor division)\n\n            But note: T must be divisible by n? Actually, no: we are just assigning the same integer t to each friend, so T = n*t, and t is the maximum integer such that n*t <= T (from each resource). \n\n            However, the total toasts method does not require T to be divisible by n, but we are then dividing by n (floor) to get the per friend toasts. \n\n            But wait, the condition for the drink in the total toasts method is T * nl <= k*l, which is equivalent to n*t*nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l)/(n*nl) -> same as the per-friend drink constraint.\n\n            Similarly, the condition for lime: T <= c*d -> n*t <= c*d -> same as per-friend lime constraint.\n\n            And salt: T*np <= p -> n*t*np <= p -> same as per-friend salt constraint.\n\n            Therefore, the two methods are equivalent:\n\n                Method 1: \n                    t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n                Method 2:\n                    T = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n                    t = T // n   (but note: T must be divisible by n? Actually, no, we are just taking floor division. However, observe:\n\n                    In the drink: T = min(...) and then we do T//n. But T might be less than n*t? \n\n            Let me check with the first sample:\n\n                First sample: \n                    Method 1: t = 2\n                    Method 2: T = 6, then 6//3=2.\n\n            Second sample:\n                    Method 1: t=3\n                    Method 2: T=19, then 19//5=3.\n\n            But wait, in the second sample, the total toasts T=19, but we are assigning 3 toasts per friend (so 15 toasts) and we have 19 slices of lime. Why did we not use all 19? \n\n            The problem says: \"make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount\". \n\n            We cannot assign more than 3 toasts per friend because 4 toasts per friend would require 20 slices (but we only have 19). \n\n            However, note: the total toasts method computed T=min(250,19,30)=19. Then we divided by 5 (the number of friends) to get 3. But 3*5=15, and we have 19 slices. Why didn't we use the remaining 4 slices?\n\n            Because the condition for the same amount: each friend must have the same number. We cannot have one friend having 4 and the others 3. \n\n            Therefore, the maximum t such that n*t <= c*d (here 5*t<=19) is t=3.\n\n            So the total toasts method does not necessarily use up all the resources. It uses the minimum of the three maximum total toasts (computed without considering the grouping) and then divides by n (using floor) to get the per friend toasts.\n\n            But wait, is it always true that the per-friend constraints (method 1) and the total toasts constraints (method 2) yield the same result?\n\n            Let me test with an example where the drink and salt are the limiting factors and the total toasts from drink and salt are not multiples of n.\n\n            Example 3: Input \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n            Expected output: 0.\n\n            Variables: n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n            Method 1:\n                Drink: (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n                Lime: (25*23) //10 = 575 //10 = 57\n                Salt: 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n                t = min(2000,57,0)=0.\n\n            Method 2:\n                Total toasts from drink: (1000*1000)//50 = 1000000//50=20000\n                Total toasts from lime: 25*23=575\n                Total toasts from salt: 1//1=1\n                T = min(20000,575,1)=1\n                Then t = 1 // 10 = 0.\n\n            So both methods give 0.\n\n            Another example: \n                n=2, k=10, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Method 1:\n                Drink: (10*10) // (2*1)=100//2=50\n                Lime: (10*10)//2=100//2=50\n                Salt: 10//(2*1)=10//2=5\n                t = min(50,50,5)=5.\n\n            Method 2:\n                Total toasts from drink: 100//1=100\n                Total toasts from lime:100\n                Total toasts from salt:10//1=10\n                T=10\n                t=10//2=5.\n\n            Now, consider an example where the total toasts from one resource is not a multiple of n, but the per-friend constraint for that resource is a multiple.\n\n            Example 4: \n                n=2, k=10, l=10, c=3, d=1, p=10, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Here, we have 3 limes, so 3 slices.\n\n            Method 1:\n                Drink: 100//2=50\n                Lime: (3*1)//2=3//2=1\n                Salt: 10//2=5\n                t=1.\n\n            Method 2:\n                Total toasts from drink:100\n                Total toasts from lime:3\n                Total toasts from salt:10\n                T=3\n                t=3//2=1.\n\n            Now, consider an example where the limiting factor is not the same in both methods.\n\n            Example 5: \n                n=2, k=10, l=10, c=5, d=1, p=3, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Lime:5 slices -> total toasts from lime:5, so T=5, then t=5//2=2 (if we use floor division). But wait, 2 per friend would require 4 slices (2*2=4) which is <=5. So t=2 is valid.\n\n            However, in the per-friend constraints:\n\n                Drink: 100//2=50\n                Lime: (5)//2=2 (because 2*2=4<=5, and 3*2=6>5 -> so 2 is the maximum per friend from lime)\n                Salt: 3//2=1 (because 2*1=2<=3, and 3*1=3<=3 -> but wait, 3//2=1, so t=1? \n\n            Wait, let's recalc for salt in method 1: \n                Condition: n*t*np <= p -> 2*t*1<=3 -> t<=1.5 -> so maximum integer t is 1.\n\n            But wait, we just saw that with t=2, the salt requirement: 2*2*1=4, but we only have 3 grams. So t=2 is invalid for salt.\n\n            Therefore, the per-friend constraint for salt is 3//2=1 (because 2*1=2<=3, but 2*2=4>3). \n\n            So t=1.\n\n            Now, method 2:\n                Total toasts from drink:100\n                Total toasts from lime:5\n                Total toasts from salt:3//1=3\n                T=min(100,5,3)=3\n                t=3//2=1.\n\n            So both methods give 1.\n\n            Example 6: \n                n=2, k=10, l=10, c=5, d=1, p=4, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Now, salt:4 grams.\n\n            Method 1:\n                Drink:50\n                Lime:2\n                Salt:4//2=2 (because 2*2=4<=4, and 2*3=6>4 -> but wait, the condition is n*t*np <= p -> 2*t*1<=4 -> t<=2. So maximum t is 2.\n\n            Method 2:\n                Total toasts from drink:100\n                Total toasts from lime:5\n                Total toasts from salt:4\n                T=min(100,5,4)=4\n                t=4//2=2.\n\n            So both methods give 2.\n\n            Therefore, we can use either method. But note:\n\n            Method 1: \n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            However, wait: the drink and salt constraints in method 1 use integer floor division, but note that the conditions are linear and we are looking for the maximum integer t that satisfies:\n\n                t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                t <= (c*d) / n\n                t <= p / (n*np)\n\n            The floor division for each term gives the maximum integer t that satisfies the individual constraint. Then the minimum of these three integers is the maximum t that satisfies all.\n\n            But note: the constraints are independent. \n\n            However, there is a caveat: the condition for the drink is n*t*nl <= k*l, which is equivalent to t <= (k*l)/(n*nl). The maximum integer t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl))? \n\n            Actually, no: the maximum integer t is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)) if we are only considering the drink, but if we consider the entire set of constraints, we take the minimum of the three floors.\n\n            However, the floor of the minimum of the three real numbers might not be the same as the floor of the minimum of the three constraints. \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Then the constraints:\n\n                Drink: t <= (1*1) / (2*1) = 0.5 -> floor(0.5)=0\n                Lime: t <= (1*1)/2=0.5 -> floor(0.5)=0\n                Salt: t <= 1/(2*1)=0.5 -> floor(0.5)=0\n\n            Then t=0.\n\n            But if we use the total toasts method:\n\n                Total toasts from drink: 1//1=1\n                Total toasts from lime:1\n                Total toasts from salt:1\n                T=1\n                t=1//2=0.\n\n            So same.\n\n            But consider:\n\n                n=2, k=3, l=1, c=3, d=1, p=3, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Then:\n\n                Drink: (3*1) // (2*1)=3//2=1\n                Lime: (3*1)//2=3//2=1\n                Salt: 3//2=1\n                t=1.\n\n            Now, with t=1, we use 2*1*1=2 ml of drink (we have 3, so ok), 2 slices of lime (we have 3, ok), and 2 grams of salt (we have 3, ok). \n\n            However, the total toasts method:\n\n                Total toasts from drink: 3//1=3\n                Total toasts from lime:3\n                Total toasts from salt:3\n                T=3\n                t=3//2=1.\n\n            So both methods work.\n\n            Conclusion: we can use either method. But note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and we are to output an integer.\n\n            We'll use:\n\n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            However, wait: the drink and salt constraints are linear and the floor division for the drink and salt in the per-friend method is correct because:\n\n                Condition: n*t*nl <= k*l   <=> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n            The maximum integer t is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)).\n\n            Similarly for the others.\n\n            But note: the lime condition: n*t <= c*d   <=> t <= (c*d) / n, and the maximum integer t is floor((c*d)/n).\n\n            However, wait: what if (c*d) is not divisible by n? Then floor((c*d)/n) is the maximum integer t such that n*t <= c*d.\n\n            So the formula is correct.\n\n            However, note: the example method 2 used total toasts and then floor division by n. But the two methods are mathematically equivalent:\n\n                In method 1: t = min( floor((k*l)/(n*nl)), floor((c*d)/n), floor(p/(n*np)) )\n\n                In method 2: T = min( floor((k*l)/nl), c*d, floor(p/np) ), then t = floor(T / n)\n\n            But wait, are these two always equal?\n\n            Let me define:\n\n                A = floor((k*l)/(n*nl))\n                B = floor((c*d)/n)\n                C = floor(p/(n*np))\n\n                Then t1 = min(A, B, C)\n\n            For method 2:\n\n                D = floor((k*l)/nl)   [= floor(total_drink / per_toast_drink)]\n                E = c*d\n                F = floor(p/np)\n\n                T = min(D, E, F)\n\n                Then t2 = floor(T / n)\n\n            Are t1 and t2 always the same?\n\n            Example 1: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n                t1 = min(20//9, 80//3, ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts based on the constraints provided by the available resources and then determining how many toasts each friend can make while ensuring everyone consumes the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, considering the constraints imposed by the available drink, limes, and salt. Each toast for one friend requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one lime slice, and `np` grams of salt.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves three main constraints:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, so the maximum number of toasts (for all friends combined) is `(k * l) // nl`. However, since each friend must have the same number of toasts, we divide this value by the number of friends `n`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available are `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum number of toasts (for all friends combined) is `c * d`. Again, dividing by `n` gives the per-friend limit.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum number of toasts (for all friends combined) is `p // np`. Dividing by `n` gives the per-friend limit.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the minimum value among the three derived values (from drink, lime, and salt constraints) after adjusting for the number of friends. This ensures that all constraints are satisfied simultaneously, and each friend gets an equal number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    drink_constraint = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    lime_constraint = (c * d) // n\n    salt_constraint = p // (n * np)\n    \n    t = min(drink_constraint, lime_constraint, salt_constraint)\n    print(t)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Constraints Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each friend's toast requires `nl` milliliters, and there are `n` friends. Thus, the maximum toasts per friend is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available are `c * d`. Each friend's toast requires one slice, so the maximum toasts per friend is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each friend's toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum toasts per friend is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The solution is the minimum value among the three constraints, ensuring all resources are sufficient and each friend can have the same number of toasts. The result is printed as an integer.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal, adhering to the problem requirements.",
