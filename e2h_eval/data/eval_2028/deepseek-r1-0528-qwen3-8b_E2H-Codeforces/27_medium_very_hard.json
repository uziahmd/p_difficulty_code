On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence is composed of two types: 1 and 2.\n\n Without reversing, the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but note that we can reverse a contiguous part.\n\n What does reversing do?\n It flips a contiguous segment. So, if we have [a, b, c] and we reverse [b, c] then it becomes [a, c, b].\n\n However, note that the entire sequence must be considered as a whole. The goal is to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: If there are no 1's, then the sequence is all 2's -> LNDS is n.\n Case 2: If there are no 2's, then the sequence is all 1's -> LNDS is n.\n\n Now, consider a mix.\n\n Without any reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing? \n But note: we can have [1, 2, 1, 2] without reversal: the LNDS is 2 (e.g., [1,2] or [1,2] at the end) but wait, actually in [1,2,1,2]:\n   We can take the first 1, then the second 2 -> that's 2.\n   Or the first 1, then the third 1 -> that's 2 (but wait, 1<=1 so that is allowed, but then we cannot take the last 2 because we skipped the second element? Actually, the entire sequence is: \n     indices: 0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2.\n   The longest non-decreasing subsequence is actually 4? No, because we cannot jump from 2 to 1. However, note: the subsequence must be increasing in indices. So we can take the first 1, then the third 1 (if we skip the 2) and then the fourth 2? But wait: 1 (at index0) <= 1 (at index2) <= 2 (at index3) -> that's 3. So the example input says output 4.\n\n Actually, the example input is: \"4\\n1 2 1 2\", and after reversing [2,3] (i.e., the middle two elements) we get [1, 1, 2, 2]. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4.\n\n Therefore, we can reverse an interval to merge two parts.\n\n How to think?\n\n We note that the entire sequence can be broken into segments of consecutive 1's and consecutive 2's.\n\n In fact, the problem reduces to: we can flip one contiguous segment (which may change the order of 1's and 2's) and we wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: In the final sequence, the non-decreasing subsequence can only consist of 1's and then 2's. The best we can do is to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then as many 2's as possible.\n\n Therefore, the maximum LNDS we can achieve is (total number of 1's) + (total number of 2's) but wait, that's n, but that is only achievable if we can arrange all 1's first and then all 2's.\n\n However, note that the reversal operation is limited: we can reverse one contiguous interval. Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily rearrange the entire sequence. But we can use reversal to bring together 1's from different segments.\n\n Let:\n   total_ones = total count of 1\n   total_twos = total count of 2\n\n The best scenario is to have all ones then all twos, which gives a LNDS of n.\n\n But is that always achievable by one reversal? Not necessarily. Consider [1,2,1,2] (n=4). Without reversal, we have two 1's and two 2's. After reversing [2,3] (the middle two), we get [1,1,2,2] -> which is sorted. So yes.\n\n However, what about [1,2,2,1]? \n   Original: [1,2,2,1] -> if we reverse [2,3] (the last three: [2,2,1] -> becomes [1,2,2,1] reversed? Actually, we can reverse [3,4] (the last two) to get [1,2,1,2] which is not sorted. \n   Alternatively, reverse [1,4]: [1,2,2,1] reversed is [1,2,2,1] -> same.\n   Reverse [2,4]: [1,1,2,2] -> that's sorted. So we can do it.\n\n But wait, [1,2,2,1]: \n   Reverse [2,4] (indices 1 to 3): [1] + reverse([2,2,1]) = [1,1,2,2].\n\n So the idea: we can use one reversal to make the entire sequence non-decreasing (all ones then all twos) if the original sequence has ones and twos and the reversal is chosen appropriately.\n\n However, consider a sequence with more than two distinct numbers? But the input is only 1 and 2.\n\n Therefore, the goal is to achieve a sequence that is all ones followed by all twos.\n\n How can we do that with one reversal?\n\n Note: We are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval. We can also choose to reverse nothing (interval of length 0) or the entire array.\n\n Conditions for achieving all ones then all twos:\n\n Let the original sequence be A.\n\n After reversing a contiguous interval [l, r], we get:\n   A[0:l-1] remains, then the reversed part A[l-1:r] (if we consider 0-indexed, then [l, r] meaning from index l to index r-1, so we have to be cautious).\n\n We wish to have the entire sequence as: [ones... , twos...]\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the leftmost occurrence of 2 (if any) and the rightmost occurrence of 1 (if any). But wait, we can also have zeros? No, only 1 and 2.\n\n 2. The goal is to move all ones to the left and all twos to the right.\n\n However, note: we can only reverse a contiguous segment. \n\n Another way: the reversal operation can fix two \"boundaries\" (where the transition from 1 to 2 happens). \n\n But note: we might not need to fix the entire sequence. We might already have some ones at the beginning and some twos at the end. The problem is that in between, we have twos and ones.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   Let L be the first index where a 2 appears (if any) and R be the last index where a 1 appears (if any).\n\n   Then, the ideal arrangement is to have all ones from 0 to (L-1) and then all twos from L to n-1? Not exactly, because the reversal doesn't necessarily put all ones at the very beginning.\n\n Actually, we can also have the reversal bringing ones from the right to the left.\n\n Example: [2,1] -> reverse [0,1] gives [1,2] -> which is sorted.\n\n Therefore, we can think of the following:\n\n   We want to choose a reversal such that the entire sequence becomes non-decreasing.\n\n   Conditions for the entire sequence to be non-decreasing (all ones then twos):\n\n      There should be no '2' that appears to the left of a '1'.\n\n   How can we remove the inversions?\n\n   The inversions are the pairs (i, j) such that i < j, A[i]=2, A[j]=1.\n\n   But note: we can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n   We can also consider: we are allowed to reverse a contiguous segment. Then the inversion pairs that are fixed must lie entirely within the reversal or span the reversal.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the reversal operation can fix the entire sequence if the entire sequence is composed of ones and twos and we can form a sequence of ones followed by twos by reversing a contiguous segment.\n\n   This is always possible? Actually, no. Consider [1,1,2,1] (with n=4). \n        Original: [1,1,2,1]\n        We want to turn it into [1,1,1,2]. We can reverse the last two: [1,1,2,1] -> reverse [2,3] (the last two) -> [1,1,1,2] -> that works.\n\n   But what about [2,1,1,2]? \n        We want [1,1,2,2]. \n        Reverse the entire array: [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2] -> same.\n        Reverse [0,1]: [1,2,1,2] -> not sorted.\n        Reverse [1,2]: [2,1,1,2] -> same as original.\n        Reverse [0,3]: [2,1,1,2] -> same.\n        Reverse [0,2]: [1,1,2,2] -> wait, let me check: \n            Original: [2,1,1,2] -> reverse [0:2] (indices 0,1,2) -> [1,1,2,2] -> yes.\n\n   So it seems we can always fix the entire sequence? \n\n   However, consider [1,2,2,1,1] (n=5). We want to turn it into [1,1,1,2,2]. \n        The inversions: the two ones at the end that are to the left of the two's? Actually, the condition is: we cannot have 2 followed by 1.\n\n        The current sequence: [1,2,2,1,1] -> the inversions are the two's that are followed by ones.\n\n        We can try reversing the middle part [1,2] (from index1 to index2) -> [1,2,2,1,1] reversed from index1 to index2: [1] + [2,2] reversed? Actually, we are reversing [1:3] (0-indexed) -> [1] + reverse([2,2]) + [1,1] -> [1,2,2,1,1] -> no change.\n\n        Reverse [2,4]: [1,2,1,1,2] -> now we have [1,2,1,1,2] -> still inversions (2 then 1 at index1 and index2).\n        Reverse [1,4]: [1] + reverse([2,2,1,1]) -> [1,1,1,2,2] -> that works.\n\n   So it seems we can always fix the entire sequence by reversing the entire part from the first 2 to the last 1? \n\n   But wait, what if the sequence is [2,1,2,1]? \n        We want to get [1,1,2,2].\n        Reverse [0,3]: [1,2,1,2] -> not sorted.\n        Reverse [0,1]: [1,2,2,1] -> not sorted.\n        Reverse [1,2]: [2,2,1,1] -> then we have [2,2,1,1] -> which is not sorted (because 2 then 1).\n        Reverse [0,2]: [2,2,1,1] -> same as above? Actually, [2,1,2,1] reversed [0:2] (first three) -> [2,2,1,1] -> not sorted.\n        Reverse [2,3]: [2,1,1,2] -> not sorted.\n        Reverse [0,3]: [1,2,1,2] -> not sorted.\n\n   So we cannot fix [2,1,2,1] by one reversal? \n\n   But note: we don't necessarily have to fix the entire sequence. Maybe we can achieve a longer non-decreasing subsequence even if the entire sequence isn't sorted.\n\n   However, note that the maximum LNDS is n (if we can sort) or less.\n\n   In [2,1,2,1] (n=4), the entire sequence cannot be sorted by one reversal, but what is the maximum LNDS we can get?\n\n   Without reversal: the original sequence [2,1,2,1] has:\n        The longest non-decreasing subsequence: \n          We can take the first 2, then the next 2 -> length 2.\n          Or the first 1, then the next 1 -> length 2.\n\n        But wait, we can also choose an interval to reverse. Let's try:\n\n        Reverse [0,0]: [2,1,2,1] -> same.\n        Reverse [1,1]: same.\n        Reverse [0,1]: [1,2,2,1] -> then the longest non-decreasing subsequence: [1,2,2] -> length 3.\n        Reverse [0,2]: [2,2,1,1] -> then the longest non-decreasing subsequence: [2,2] or [1,1] -> length 2.\n        Reverse [0,3]: [1,2,1,2] -> then the longest non-decreasing subsequence: [1,2] (or [1,1] or [2,2]) -> length 2.\n        Reverse [1,2]: [2,1,2,1] -> same as original.\n        Reverse [1,3]: [2,1,1,2] -> then the longest non-decreasing subsequence: [2,2] (if we take the two 2's) or [1,1] -> length 2, but wait: [2,1,1,2] -> we can take the first 2, then the last 2 -> that's 2. Or we can take the two 1's -> 2. Or we can take the first 2 and then the two 1's? But 2<=1 is false. So maximum 2.\n\n        Reverse [0,1] gives [1,2,2,1] -> then we can take [1,2,2] (length 3) or [1,1] (length 2) -> so 3.\n\n        Reverse [2,3]: [2,1,1,2] -> same as above.\n\n        So the answer for [2,1,2,1] is 3.\n\n   Therefore, we don't necessarily need to fix the entire sequence.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   We know that the entire sequence is only 1's and 2's. The LNDS is the length of the longest chain of 1's and then 2's.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n     Option 1: The entire sequence might be non-decreasing (then answer is n).\n     Option 2: Otherwise, we can reverse one contiguous segment to merge some ones and twos.\n\n   Since n is up to 2000, we can try to consider all possibilities? But 2000 is too big for O(n^2) in worst-case if we try every reversal and then compute the LNDS (which for a sequence of 2000 would be O(n^2) or O(n log n) with standard algorithms, so worst-case O(n^3)).\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   The entire sequence can be divided into:\n\n     - The left part (prefix) that is all ones.\n     - The right part (suffix) that is all twos.\n\n   Then the middle part is the remaining. We can reverse the middle part arbitrarily. But note: the reversal operation is contiguous.\n\n   Actually, the reversal operation is allowed on any contiguous interval. So we can choose to reverse a part that is entirely in the middle, or that overlaps the boundaries.\n\n   The goal is to maximize the total count of ones and twos that we can put in the left part (ones) and then the right part (twos).\n\n   Let:\n     Let x = the number of ones in the entire sequence.\n     Let y = the number of twos.\n\n   Then, the maximum LNDS we can get is at most x+y = n.\n\n   But we might not be able to get n.\n\n   However, note that we can always get at least the original longest non-decreasing subsequence (without reversal) and then try to improve by reversing.\n\n   How can we approach?\n\n   We note that the reversal operation can only change the order of the elements. Since the sequence is binary, we can consider the positions of ones and twos.\n\n   Let the original array be A.\n\n   Without reversal, the LNDS is: \n        We can use DP: \n          Let dp[i][state] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i, and state indicates the last element (1 or 2) but note the sequence is only 1 and 2 so we can do:\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise we can break the sequence into runs.\n\n        But note: the entire sequence is 1's and 2's, so the LNDS is the length of the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 appears before a 1). Otherwise, we can have:\n\n          The LNDS = (number of ones) + (number of twos) but wait, that would be n, but that is only if the entire sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we cannot take all ones and then all twos.\n\n        Actually, the LNDS in a binary sequence (1 and 2) is the maximum k such that there exists a subsequence of k elements that is non-decreasing. \n\n        But note: we can skip elements arbitrarily. So the LNDS is at least the maximum run of consecutive ones and consecutive twos, but we can combine ones and then twos.\n\n        Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if all ones come before all twos.\n\n        Otherwise, we can take all the ones that are available and then all the twos that are available, but we cannot take a 2 that is before an unmatched 1? \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to skip. So the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing, but if there is a 2 that comes before a 1, then we cannot use that 1 after that 2? \n\n        Actually, we can: the subsequence does not require contiguous elements, but the indices must be increasing. So we can take a 1 that appears later even if there is a 2 in between.\n\n        Therefore, the LNDS in a binary sequence (only 1 and 2) is simply the total number of elements? \n\n        Wait, no: consider [2,1] -> the LNDS is 1 (if we take either the 2 or the 1). Actually, no: we can take two elements? [2,1] is decreasing, so we cannot take both. But we can take one element. However, note the definition: non-decreasing. So we can take [2] or [1] (each of length 1). \n\n        But wait, the example [1,2,1,2] without reversal: we can take the first 1 and then the third 1 (skipping the 2) and then the fourth 2? That would be 1,1,2 -> but wait, the indices: \n            index0:1, index2:1, index3:2 -> valid. So the LNDS is 3.\n\n        How to compute the LNDS for a binary sequence?\n\n        We can use DP:\n\n          Let dp[i][0] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 1 (considering the prefix up to i)\n          Let dp[i][1] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 2.\n\n        Then, for each position i (0-indexed) with value v (0 for 1, 1 for 2):\n\n          dp[i][0] = 1 + max_{j < i and A[j]==1} dp[j][0], but if there's no previous 1 then 1.\n          Similarly, for 2: we can extend a subsequence ending with 1 or with 2? But note: 1<=2, so we can extend a subsequence ending with 1 or 2.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let dp[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n\n          Then, \n            dp[i] = 1\n            If A[i] == 2, then we can extend any subsequence ending at j (for j < i) that ends with 1 or 2, provided that the last element is <=2 (which is always true). So we can take the maximum of dp[j] for all j < i and then set dp[i] = max_dp + 1.\n\n          But wait, the condition for non-decreasing: \n            For A[i]=1, we can only extend a subsequence ending with 1 (if any) or start new.\n            For A[i]=2, we can extend a subsequence ending with 1 or 2.\n\n          However, we can also not extend: we can just take the element.\n\n          So:\n\n            dp[i] = 1\n            if A[i] == 1:\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if A[j] == 1:\n                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1)\n            else: # A[i]==2\n                for j in range(i):\n                    # if A[j] is 1 or 2, then we can extend\n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1)\n\n          Then the answer is max(dp).\n\n        But note: the entire sequence is only 1 and 2, so the non-decreasing condition for two elements is just that the first element is <= the second.\n\n        However, the above DP is O(n^2) and n=2000 -> 4e6 operations, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but note we have to do this for every reversal? \n\n        But wait, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. We are not forced to reverse the entire array. We have to consider every possible reversal and then compute the LNDS for the resulting array.\n\n        How many reversals? There are O(n^2) reversals (each reversal is defined by two indices l and r, so about n*(n+1)/2). And for each reversal, we build a new array and then run an O(n^2) DP -> worst-case about 2000^2 * (2000^2) = 16e9 * 4e6 = 64e15, which is too slow.\n\n   We need a better approach.\n\n   Alternative Insight:\n\n   Since the sequence is binary, we can represent the sequence as a string of 1's and 2's.\n\n   The reversal operation is symmetric. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which in a binary sequence is equivalent to having as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then as many 2's as possible.\n\n   The entire sequence can be split into:\n\n        [ones] [twos] \n\n   But we can also have a block in the middle that we reverse, which might bring ones from the right to the left and vice versa.\n\n   Let the original array be A.\n\n   After reversal, the array becomes:\n\n        B = A[0:l] + reverse(A[l:r]) + A[r:]\n\n   We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n   Note: the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (ones then twos). Otherwise, we can break the sequence into:\n\n        Part 1: The prefix (from start to some point) that is all ones.\n        Part 2: The suffix (from some point to the end) that is all twos.\n\n   But the entire sequence might be non-decreasing, then we are done.\n\n   Otherwise, the LNDS is the sum of the number of ones and twos, but wait, no: we cannot take a one that appears after a two in the subsequence? \n\n   Actually, we can: the subsequence does not require contiguous ones and then contiguous twos, but we can interleave? \n\n   However, note: the non-decreasing condition: 1<=1, 1<=2, 2<=2, but 2<=1 is false. So the subsequence must have all ones (any ones) and then all twos (any twos) that appear after the last one we took.\n\n   But wait, we can take a one, then a two, then a one? No, because 2<=1 is false.\n\n   Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum k such that there is a subsequence of k elements that is of the form [some ones] then [some twos] (the ones must come before the twos in the original sequence? Not necessarily, because we can skip arbitrarily. But the condition is: the indices must be increasing. \n\n   Actually, we can take:\n\n        All the ones that appear in the entire sequence, and then all the twos that appear in the entire sequence, provided that we can arrange them so that the last one we take is a one and then we take a two that appears at a later index? \n\n   However, note: we can skip ones that appear after a two? \n\n   Example: [1,2,1] \n        We can take the first 1 and the last 1? But then we skip the 2. But wait, the condition for non-decreasing: 1<=1 is true, so we can take two ones. But we can also take the first 1 and the 2 -> that's 2, or the 2 and the last 1 -> invalid.\n\n        Actually, the longest is 2 (either two ones or one one and one two).\n\n        But note: we can take the first 1 and the last 1, skipping the 2, and that forms a non-decreasing subsequence of two ones.\n\n   Therefore, the LNDS is not necessarily the entire sequence. \n\n   How to compute the LNDS for a given array? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        Let f = total ones in the array.\n        Let g = total twos in the array.\n\n        But wait, we can combine: we can take some ones and then some twos, but the ones we take must be from the part that is before the first two we take.\n\n        Actually, the standard way for a binary sequence (with two distinct numbers) is:\n\n            Let x = the last occurrence of 1 that we can use to transition to 2's.\n\n            The entire LNDS is: (# of ones that appear at or before the last one) + (# of twos that appear at or after the first two) ?\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let dp0[i] = the maximum number of ones we can take from the beginning up to i (if we are going to use a two after i, then we must have taken all ones before the two we take).\n            But that is complex.\n\n   Another idea: the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we can assign to each element a \"group\" (0 for ones, 1 for twos) and the groups are non-decreasing.\n\n   Then, the LNDS is the length of the entire sequence? No, because we can skip arbitrarily.\n\n   Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence (with values 1 and 2) is the maximum between:\n\n        Option 1: Take all the ones (in increasing order of indices) and then as many twos as we can (that appear after the last one we took) but we can also interleave ones and twos if we wish? \n\n   But wait, the condition is non-decreasing: once we take a two, we cannot take a one afterward.\n\n   So the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists an increasing sequence of indices i1 < i2 < ... < ik, and the values at these indices are either all ones or ones followed by twos.\n\n   This is equivalent to: we can take a set of ones (any subset of ones) and then a set of twos (any subset of twos) provided that the last one we take (by index) is before the first two we take.\n\n   Actually, no: we can take ones and then twos, and the ones we take must be the ones that occur at indices less than the indices of the twos we take.\n\n   So the LNDS = (# of ones that appear in the entire sequence) + (# of twos that appear in the entire sequence) if the entire sequence is non-decreasing (ones then twos). \n\n   But if there are inversions (2 before 1) then we cannot take the entire sequence. However, we can still take:\n\n        Let x = the total number of ones.\n        Let y = the total number of twos.\n\n        Then, the LNDS is at least the entire sequence if we can reorder by reversal? But we are not allowed to arbitrarily reorder, only one reversal.\n\n   However, note: the reversal operation is contiguous. \n\n   Let's reframe:\n\n   The problem is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence by reversing one contiguous segment.\n\n   Since the sequence is binary, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum number of elements we can pick such that we never have a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n   And note: we can pick any set of elements as long as the indices are increasing and the values are non-decreasing.\n\n   But since the only values are 1 and 2, the condition is that once we pick a 2, we cannot pick a 1 afterward.\n\n   Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum integer k such that there exists a subsequence of length k that is composed of some ones (possibly all ones) and then some twos (possibly all twos), and the last one in the subsequence (if any) must appear before the first two in the subsequence.\n\n   But note: we can also have a subsequence that is all ones or all twos.\n\n   So the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n        Option 1: The entire sequence if it is non-decreasing.\n        Option 2: Otherwise, we can choose a cut point: we take all the ones that appear before a certain point and all the twos that appear after that point.\n\n   But wait, we can also take ones that appear after a two if we haven't taken that two? \n\n   Actually, the rule is: we can take a one and then a two that appears later, even if there is a two between them? Yes, because the two that appears between them is not taken.\n\n   However, we cannot take a two and then a one.\n\n   Therefore, the entire sequence's LNDS is:\n\n        Let I = list of indices of ones.\n        Let J = list of indices of twos.\n\n        We wish to choose a set of indices that is increasing and the values are 1 or 2, and if we ever switch from 1 to 2, we cannot go back.\n\n        This is equivalent to: we can take any subset of ones and then any subset of twos, provided that the last one we take (by index) is before the first two we take (by index).\n\n        So the LNDS = (number of ones that appear at or before a certain index) + (number of twos that appear at or after a certain index) for some split.\n\n        But note: we can also take ones that appear after a two if we haven't taken any two? \n\n        Actually, no: because if we take a two, then we cannot take a one afterward. But if we don't take a two, then we can take ones arbitrarily.\n\n        So the LNDS is the maximum over all possible splits:\n\n            Let p be the last one we take (if we take any one) and q be the first two we take (if we take any two). Then p must be < q.\n\n        But note: we don't have to take a two. Then the LNDS is the total number of ones.\n\n        Similarly, we don't have to take a one.\n\n        Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n            Option A: total ones (if we take no two)\n            Option B: total twos (if we take no one)\n            Option C: for every pair (i, j) where i is an occurrence of one and j is an occurrence of two and i < j, then the number of ones <= i (including i) plus the number of twos >= j (including j).\n\n        But note: we can also take ones that are after j? No, because then we would have taken a two (at j) and then a one (after j) -> not allowed.\n\n        However, we can also take ones that are after i but before j? Yes, because they are ones and we haven't switched to two yet.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: we can take all ones that are at or before j and all twos that are at or after i, but wait: we must ensure that the last one we take is before the first two we take.\n\n        Let F = the total number of ones in the entire sequence.\n        Let G = the total number of twos.\n\n        We can take:\n\n            Let X = the number of ones from the beginning to j-1 (for some j, an occurrence of two) and then Y = the number of twos from j to the end.\n\n            But also, we can take ones that are not contiguous? Actually, we can take any ones that are at indices < j and any twos that are at indices > i, but note: we must not take a two before the last one we take.\n\n        Actually, the standard solution for binary sequences is known: \n\n            We can transform the sequence into a permutation of 0's and 1's (say 1->0, 2->1) and then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the longest subsequence of 0's followed by 1's, which is equivalent to the longest alternating subsequence? \n\n        But note: non-decreasing means 0 then 1 is allowed, but 1 then 0 is not.\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n            Let B = [0 if a==1 else 1 for a in A]\n\n            Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the longest subsequence that is 0's followed by 1's.\n\n            And that is: \n                We can use a greedy method: \n                    Let x = the number of zeros (which are ones) in the entire sequence.\n                    Let y = the number of ones (which are twos) in the entire sequence.\n\n                But then we can also consider: we can take all zeros and then all ones, but only if the zeros are before the ones.\n\n                So we need to find a split index such that we take all zeros up to that split and all ones from that split onward.\n\n            Specifically, the LNDS is the maximum over k (from 0 to n) of (number of zeros in [0, k-1] + number of ones in [k, n-1]), where k is the split index (meaning we take everything before k as zeros and everything from k onward as ones).\n\n            But note: the zeros (ones) can be scattered. And the condition for non-decreasing is that we cannot have a one (represented by 1) before a zero (represented by 0) in the subsequence.\n\n            However, in our transformed sequence, a non-decreasing subsequence is allowed to have zeros then ones, but not ones then zeros.\n\n            But wait, the transformation: \n                Original 1 becomes 0, and 2 becomes 1.\n                Then a non-decreasing subsequence in the transformed sequence requires that we never have a 1 followed by a 0.\n\n            And that is exactly the condition.\n\n            So the length is the number of zeros (ones) in the prefix [0, k-1] and the number of ones (twos) in the suffix [k, n-1]. \n\n            But note: we can also take zeros (ones) that appear after k? No, because if we take a zero (one) after k, then we would have taken a one (two) at k or after k and then a zero (one) which is not allowed.\n\n            Therefore, the formula for a fixed array A (without reversal) is:\n\n                Let B = [0 if x==1 else 1 for x in A]\n                Let prefix0[i] = number of zeros in B[0:i+1]\n                Let suffix1[i] = number of ones in B[i:]\n\n                Then, for a split at index i (meaning we take zeros from [0,i] and ones from [i+1, n-1]), the length is prefix0[i] + (n - i - 1 + (i+1 to n-1 ones))? \n\n            Actually, we can also take zeros and ones arbitrarily as long as we don't violate the order. But the split must be such that the last zero we take is at index <= i, and the first one we take is at index >= i+1.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to skip. So the best we can do is to take all zeros that appear at or before i and all ones that appear at or after i+1.\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence can be maximized by ensuring that as many 1s as possible appear before any 2s, leveraging the reversal operation to optimize this arrangement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence can include any number of 1s followed by any number of 2s. The goal is to reverse a contiguous subarray such that the resulting sequence has the maximum possible number of elements in this form (i.e., all 1s followed by all 2s).\n\n2. **Insight**: The optimal solution involves transforming the problem into finding a split point in the sequence where all elements before the split are 1s and all elements after are 2s. The reversal operation allows us to \"gather\" 1s from scattered positions into the left part and 2s into the right part.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Compute two arrays:\n     - `prefix_ones[i]` counts the number of 1s up to index `i`.\n     - `suffix_twos[i]` counts the number of 2s from index `i` to the end.\n   - **Maximize LNDS**: For each possible split point, calculate the sum of 1s before the split and 2s after the split. The maximum value of these sums across all split points gives the answer.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves two passes over the array to compute prefix and suffix counts (O(n)) and another pass to find the maximum sum (O(n)), resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * n\n    suffix_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    prefix_ones[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 1 else 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    suffix_twos[n-1] = 1 if arr[n-1] == 2 else 0\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        ones_left = prefix_ones[i]\n        twos_right = suffix_twos[i+1] if i+1 < n else 0\n        total = ones_left + twos_right\n        if total > max_len:\n            max_len = total\n            \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: \n   - `prefix_ones[i]` stores the count of 1s from the start of the array up to index `i`.\n   - `suffix_twos[i]` stores the count of 2s from index `i` to the end of the array.\n\n2. **Finding Maximum LNDS**: \n   - For each index `i`, consider splitting the array into two parts: all elements before `i+1` should be 1s, and all elements from `i+1` onwards should be 2s.\n   - The sum of 1s before `i+1` and 2s from `i+1` onwards gives the length of the LNDS for that split. The maximum value across all possible splits is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of binary sequences and contiguous subarray reversal to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.",
