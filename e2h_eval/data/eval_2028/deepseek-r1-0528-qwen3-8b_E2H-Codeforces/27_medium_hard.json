    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence is composed of two types: 1 and 2.\n\n Without reversing, the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but note that we can reverse a contiguous part.\n\n What does reversing do?\n It flips a contiguous segment. So, if we have a segment that originally is: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1] and we reverse it, we get [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\n However, note that the goal is to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n In the best scenario, we would like to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then as many 2's as possible at the end.\n\n Let:\n   total_ones = total number of 1's in the entire array.\n   total_twos = total number of 2's in the entire array.\n\n But note: we don't necessarily have to use all the ones and twos. However, the entire sequence is fixed, and the reversal operation might change the order.\n\n Consider: \n   The entire sequence is divided into three parts:\n      Part1: from index 0 to l-2 (left part, unchanged)\n      Part2: the reversed interval [l-1, r-1] (which we reverse)\n      Part3: from index r to n-1 (right part, unchanged)\n\n The non-decreasing subsequence must be contiguous? No, but we are allowed to pick arbitrarily (non contiguous indices). However, note that after reversal, the entire sequence is fixed.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the longest non-decreasing subsequence (not necessarily contiguous). However, because the sequence only has 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is just the entire sequence if the entire sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise we take all the 1's and then all the 2's.\n\n However, wait: what if we break the sequence? Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1 and 2 is the maximum number of consecutive 1's (from the start) plus the maximum number of consecutive 2's (from the end) that we can form, but also we can mix? Actually, no: the non-decreasing condition requires that we cannot have a 2 then a 1. Therefore, the entire subsequence must be all 1's or all 2's, or a sequence that starts with some 1's and then some 2's (with no 1's after 2's). \n\n So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n   Option1: Take all the 1's and then as many 2's as we can without having a 2 followed by a 1? Actually, we can choose arbitrarily. But note: the entire sequence might have multiple segments of 1's and 2's.\n\n However, note: we can reverse one contiguous interval. This reversal might help us to merge two segments.\n\n Example: [1, 2, 1, 2] -> reverse [2,3] (i.e., the middle two) becomes [1,1,2,2]. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing.\n\n How do we think about it?\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let x = the entire sequence. We can reverse any contiguous part. What effect does that have?\n\n Note: The reversal operation might help to bring together the ones and twos so that we have a block of 1's and then a block of 2's.\n\n The ideal scenario is to have all the 1's at the beginning and all the 2's at the end. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing and the LNDS is n.\n\n But if we cannot achieve that, then we try to maximize the number of 1's at the beginning and 2's at the end.\n\n However, note: sometimes we can't have all the 1's at the beginning because there are 2's that are forced to be before some 1's. Similarly for 2's.\n\n But observe: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. This means we can \"flip\" a segment that might contain both 1's and 2's.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let A = the original array.\n\n Without any reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. The LNDS is the maximum between:\n   - The whole sequence if it is non-decreasing? But if there's a 2 and then a 1, then we break. Alternatively, we can compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the usual way (which for 1 and 2 is simply: take all the 1's and then as many 2's as you can without breaking the condition, but actually we can skip some 2's? Actually, the usual method for two distinct numbers: we can take all the 1's and then the 2's that come after the last 1 we took? But wait, we can interleave? Actually, no: because we require non-decreasing, so once we take a 2 we cannot take a 1 later.\n\n Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for two numbers is:\n   Let dp[i] = (count1, count2) ending at i, but note we can have two possibilities: either we take a 1 or a 2.\n\n However, note: the problem is small (n<=2000) but we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. We need to consider all possible reversals (O(n^2)) and then compute the LNDS for the resulting sequence. But computing the LNDS for a sequence of length 2000 is O(n^2) (using the standard method which is O(n^2) for arbitrary sequences). Then overall O(n^4) which is too slow.\n\n We need a better idea.\n\n Insight:\n\n Since the array consists only of 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n   Option 1: All the 1's and then the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took? Actually, we can take all the 1's and then as many 2's as we want (but we cannot take a 1 after a 2). So the entire LNDS is the total number of 1's we can have at the beginning (until a 2 appears and then we can have the rest of the 2's). But note: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily (non contiguous) so we can skip some 1's and 2's arbitrarily? Actually, the classic longest non-decreasing subsequence for two numbers is: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that occur after the last taken 1. But we can also skip some 1's if we want to extend the 2's? Actually, no: because if we skip a 1, then we might be able to take more 2's? Actually, the entire sequence of 1's and 2's: the LNDS is simply the total number of 1's in the entire sequence plus the total number of 2's that occur at or after the first occurrence of a 2? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, the standard way: \n   Let x = the entire sequence. We can break the sequence into two parts: the ones and the twos. The non-decreasing subsequence can be any sequence that is all 1's, or any sequence that is all 2's, or a sequence that is some 1's (possibly not contiguous) followed by some 2's (possibly not contiguous). But note: the entire set of 1's and 2's is fixed, but we cannot have a 2 then a 1.\n\n Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists a subsequence of k elements that are 1's and 2's and that does not contain a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n This is equivalent to: we can choose all the 1's and then from the remaining positions (that are not chosen as 1's) we can choose 2's, but wait: actually, we can choose arbitrarily. But note: we can also choose a set of 1's and 2's that are interleaved arbitrarily as long as no 2 comes before a 1 that isn't taken? Actually, no: the condition is that if we have a 2 then we cannot have a 1 later. So the subsequence must be: some 1's (in increasing index order) and then some 2's (in increasing index order). \n\n However, we are allowed to skip arbitrarily. Then the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists an increasing sequence of indices i1 < i2 < ... < ik and values either 1 or 2, and the values are non-decreasing.\n\n Since the values are only 1 and 2, the condition is that we cannot have a 2 then a 1. So we can take all the 1's and then as many 2's as we want (without worrying about the order of the 2's relative to the 1's, because we are allowed to skip the 1's that are after the 2's we take? Actually, no: we must take the 1's and 2's in increasing index order.\n\n Actually, we can take a 2 that appears earlier and then skip all the 1's that appear after that 2. But then we cannot take a 1 that appears after a 2 we have taken. \n\n Therefore, the entire LNDS is the maximum over all splits (a point where we switch from 1 to 2) of:\n   (number of 1's from the entire array that we can take without taking any 2 that forces us to stop) + (number of 2's from the entire array that we can take after the last 1 we take)\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. So we can change the order of a contiguous segment.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the original array be A.\n\n After reversal, the array is B, which is the same as A except for one contiguous segment [l, r] which is reversed.\n\n The reversal operation might help to move 1's to the left and 2's to the right.\n\n We wish to maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\n Note: the entire sequence has total_ones 1's and total_twos 2's. The maximum possible LNDS is min(total_ones + total_twos, n) (which is n) but we might not be able to arrange all 1's then all 2's.\n\n However, note: even if we can arrange all 1's then all 2's, then the LNDS is n. But sometimes we cannot.\n\n But wait, the reversal operation: we can reverse one contiguous interval. This reversal might help us to put all the 1's at the beginning and all the 2's at the end? \n\n Condition for achieving the entire sequence being non-decreasing (all 1's then all 2's): \n   There should be no 2 in the left part (the part that we did not reverse) and no 1 in the right part? Actually, the reversal operation can fix some inversions.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation doesn't change the multiset of the array. So the entire sequence still has the same number of 1's and 2's.\n\n Therefore, the maximum LNDS we can get is at most n, but we might not be able to get n because we cannot change the multiset.\n\n But wait: the LNDS is not necessarily the entire sequence. We can always get at least the total_ones (if we take all the 1's) or the total_twos (if we take all the 2's) or a combination (like the total_ones + total_twos if the entire sequence is non-decreasing). \n\n However, note: we can combine 1's and 2's. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements we can choose such that we never have a 2 then a 1. \n\n Since the entire sequence has total_ones 1's and total_twos 2's, the maximum LNDS is at most total_ones + total_twos (which is n). And we can always get n if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we might be able to get less.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. We wish to maximize the LNDS.\n\n Another observation: the reversal operation can fix the order of a contiguous segment. In fact, we can consider that the reversal operation can fix any set of inversions within that segment, but also it might create new inversions with the surrounding parts.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation can be used to push 2's to the left and 1's to the right? Actually, reversing a segment [l, r] will turn the segment from (some pattern) to its reverse. \n\n Let me try to break down the problem:\n\n Let F(B) = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of B.\n\n Since B is obtained by reversing a contiguous part of A, we can consider:\n\n   Without reversal, we can compute F(A) (the original sequence).\n\n   Then we try every possible reversal and compute F(B). Then take the maximum.\n\n But n is up to 2000, and for each reversal (O(n^2)) we cannot run an O(n^2) algorithm (like the standard patience sorting for longest non-decreasing subsequence) because that would be O(n^4) (2000^4 is 16e12, too slow).\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Let's think about the structure of the sequence of 1 and 2.\n\n The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum k such that there exists an increasing sequence of indices i1, i2, ..., ik and values v_i1, v_i2, ..., v_ik with v_i1 <= v_i2 <= ... <= v_ik.\n\n But note: the values are only 1 and 2.\n\n Therefore, the entire LNDS is the maximum of:\n   Option1: Take all the 1's (which gives total_ones) OR\n   Option2: Take all the 2's (which gives total_twos) OR\n   Option3: Take a sequence that is a mix of 1's and 2's.\n\n But wait, we can take a sequence that is all 1's and then all 2's? Actually, the entire sequence of 1's and then 2's (without any 2 then 1) is non-decreasing.\n\n So the LNDS is the maximum number of elements we can take that are either all 1's, or all 2's, or a sequence of 1's (possibly not contiguous) and then 2's (possibly not contiguous) such that the 1's we take are from the entire sequence and the 2's we take are from the entire sequence, but we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1 that we skip? Actually, we can take arbitrarily. The constraint is that we cannot have a 2 then a 1 in the chosen subsequence.\n\n However, note: the entire set of 1's and 2's is fixed. The condition for a valid subsequence is that if we take a 2 at position i and a 1 at position j (with i<j) then that is not allowed. Therefore, we can take:\n\n   All the 1's and then as many 2's as we want that appear after the last 1 we took? Actually, no: we can take 2's that appear anywhere, but if we take a 2 that appears before a 1 that we haven't taken, that is allowed? Actually, no: the subsequence must be non-decreasing, and if we take a 2 and then later (in the array) we take a 1, that breaks the condition. But note: the indices must be increasing, so if we take a 2 at index i and then a 1 at index j (with i<j) then that is not allowed.\n\n So the rule is: we can take a 1 at any position, and then we can take a 2 at any position that comes after the last 1 we took, but we cannot take a 1 after taking a 2.\n\n Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum over all choices of a split point (a position where we switch from taking 1's to taking 2's) of:\n\n   (# of 1's in the entire array that are at or before the split point) + (# of 2's in the entire array that are at or after the split point)\n\n But wait, we can also skip some 1's and 2's arbitrarily. Actually, we are not forced to take contiguous ones. We can choose the split point arbitrarily, but note: the split point is the last index at which we take a 1. Then we can take all the 1's that occur at or before the split point, and then all the 2's that occur at or after the split point (but note: we can skip some 2's? Actually, we are allowed to take any 2's that occur after the split point, but we don't have to take contiguous ones. However, the condition is that we cannot take a 2 that occurs before a 1 we skip? Actually, no: the condition is only on the subsequence we choose. We can choose 1's and 2's arbitrarily as long as they are in increasing index order and the values are non-decreasing.\n\n But note: the above formula does not account for 2's that occur before the split point? Actually, we can take 2's that occur after the split point, but we can also take 2's that occur before the split point? Only if we haven't taken a 1 that is after that 2. \n\n Alternatively, let's define:\n\n   Let x be the last index of 1 that we take. Then we can take:\n        Count1 = number of 1's from the entire array that are at or before x (but we are free to skip some 1's? Actually, we want to maximize the count, so we take all 1's up to x) and then we can take all 2's that are at or after x (because we cannot take a 1 after x, so we must take only 2's from x onward).\n\n But wait, we can take a 2 that occurs at an index < x? Only if we haven't taken a 1 that is after that 2. However, if we take a 2 at an index i (which is < x) then we cannot take a 1 at an index j>i (so we cannot take the 1 at x). But we are forced to not take the 1 at x because we are taking a 2 at i (which is earlier) and then we see a 1 at x (later) which is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, the above formula does not hold.\n\n Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence (only 1 and 2) is:\n\n   Let dp[i] = (a, b) where a = the maximum number of 1's we can take ending at i, and b = the maximum number of 2's we can take from the part after i? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following greedy:\n\n   The entire LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists a sequence of k elements that are either 1 or 2 and the sequence is non-decreasing.\n\n   Since the sequence is non-decreasing, we can have a run of 1's and then a run of 2's.\n\n   Therefore, we can consider: we choose a point i (which may be fractional) such that we take all the 1's that are at or before i and all the 2's that are at or after i, but we cannot break the condition: we must not take a 2 that is before a 1 that we didn't take? \n\n   Actually, we can break the sequence into two parts by a virtual split. We can take:\n\n        Some 1's from the entire sequence (anywhere) and then some 2's from the entire sequence (anywhere) provided that all the 1's we take are to the left of all the 2's we take.\n\n   Why? Because if we take a 2 that is to the left of a 1, then we have a 2 then a 1 in the subsequence, which is decreasing.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: the set of indices for the 1's must be entirely to the left of the set of indices for the 2's.\n\n   Then the total number of elements we can take is (number of 1's we choose) + (number of 2's we choose). And we wish to maximize that.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily, so we can choose all the 1's and then as many 2's as we want, but wait: if we choose all the 1's, then we cannot choose any 2 that is to the left of the last 1 we take. However, we are free to choose which 1's and which 2's.\n\n   Actually, we can choose:\n\n        Let X = the set of 1's we choose, and Y = the set of 2's we choose.\n        Condition: max(index in X) < min(index in Y)\n\n        Then |X|+|Y| is the length.\n\n   And we wish to maximize |X|+|Y|.\n\n   This is equivalent to: we choose a split index s (a real number) such that we take all the 1's with index <= s and all the 2's with index > s.\n\n   Then the total is (number of 1's <= s) + (number of 2's > s).\n\n   But note: we can choose s arbitrarily (even between two indices). Then the maximum value of (number of 1's <= s) + (number of 2's > s) is achieved by choosing s appropriately.\n\n   However, the reversal operation changes the array. \n\n   Without reversal, the array is fixed. With reversal, the array is modified in one contiguous segment.\n\n   Our goal is to find a reversal [l, r] that maximizes the value of:\n\n        F(s) = (# of 1's in the entire array with index <= s) + (# of 2's in the entire array with index > s)\n\n   for some s (which we can choose optimally for the new array).\n\n   But note: after reversal, the array changes. The positions of the 1's and 2's in the reversed segment are swapped.\n\n   Therefore, we can precompute:\n\n        Let B = A after reversal of [l, r].\n\n        Then we wish to compute: \n            Let f(s) = (# of 1's in B from index0 to s) + (# of 2's in B from s+1 to the end)\n\n        Then the answer for this reversal is the maximum f(s) over s in [-1, n-1] (s being a real number, but we can consider integer indices or between integers).\n\n   However, note: the reversal operation is defined by [l, r]. We have to consider the effect on the entire array.\n\n   How to compute the effect of reversal [l, r] on the counts?\n\n   Let:\n        Original array: A[0..n-1]\n\n        We reverse A[l..r] to get B.\n\n        In B, the segment [l, r] is the reverse of A[l..r].\n\n        The rest of the array remains the same.\n\n   Now, we wish to compute for each s (from -1 to n-1) the value:\n\n        left_ones(s) = number of 1's in B[0..s]\n        right_twos(s) = number of 2's in B[s+1..n-1]\n\n        Then candidate = left_ones(s) + right_twos(s)\n\n   But note: the entire sequence has total_ones and total_twos, so the maximum candidate is total_ones+total_twos (if we can have all 1's and all 2's). But we are constrained by the reversal.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire array's total_ones and total_twos remain the same. The candidate value for a given s is:\n\n        (# of 1's in B[0..s]) + (# of 2's in B[s+1..n-1])\n\n   But note: the total number of 1's in B is total_ones, and the total number of 2's is total_twos.\n\n   Also, the candidate for s is:\n\n        (ones in [0..s] in B) + (twos in [s+1..n-1] in B)\n\n   = total_ones + (twos in [0..s] in B) ? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we can also express:\n\n        candidate(s) = (ones in [0..s]) + (twos in [s+1..n-1])\n\n   = (ones in [0..s]) + (total_twos - (twos in [0..s]))\n\n   = total_twos + (ones in [0..s]) - (twos in [0..s])\n\n   But wait, that is not true because the segment [0..s] has both ones and twos, and the entire array has total_twos, so the twos in [0..s] is known. Then:\n\n        candidate(s) = (ones_in_B[0..s]) + (total_twos - (twos_in_B[0..s]))\n\n   But note: the entire array has total_ones ones, so:\n\n        ones_in_B[0..s] + ones_in_B[s+1..n-1] = total_ones\n        similarly for twos.\n\n   And also, the segment [0..s] has (ones_in_B[0..s] + twos_in_B[0..s]) = s+1.\n\n   But that doesn't seem to help directly.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the candidate(s) can be computed if we know the distribution of 1's and 2's in the entire array and how the reversal affects the counts.\n\n   However, we are iterating over all O(n^2) reversals and for each reversal we need to compute the candidate(s) for all s (which is O(n)) and then take the maximum candidate. That is O(n^3) which is acceptable for n=2000? 2000^3 = 8e9, which is borderline in C++ but in Python might be too slow.\n\n   But note: n is 2000, and the reversal operation is O(n^2) (about 2e6 reversals) and each reversal we do an O(n) computation (over s from -1 to n-1) then 2e6 * 2001 ~ 4e9 operations, which in Python might be too slow.\n\n   We need a more efficient way.\n\n   Let me reframe:\n\n   We wish to compute for a given reversal [l, r]:\n\n        Let B = A with the segment [l, r] reversed.\n\n        Then for each s from -1 to n-1:\n\n            candidate(s) = (# of 1's in B[0..s]) + (# of 2's in B[s+1..n-1])\n\n        and then the answer for this reversal is the maximum candidate(s).\n\n   How to compute (# of 1's in B[0..s]) quickly?\n\n        The array B is the same as A except for [l, r]. \n\n        We can precompute the prefix sums for the original array A for 1's and 2's.\n\n        Let pre_ones[i] = number of 1's in A[0..i-1] (for i from 0 to n, with pre_ones[0]=0, pre_ones[i] for i>=1 is the count from 0 to i-1)\n\n        Similarly, pre_twos[i] = number of 2's in A[0..i-1]\n\n        Then for a given reversal [l, r] (0-indexed, and the reversed segment is from index l to index r), we need to update the counts for the segment.\n\n        The reversed segment: \n            Original segment: A[l..r] has some ones and twos.\n            After reversal, the ones and twos in that segment are swapped in terms of their positions.\n\n        But note: the reversal doesn't change the multiset of the segment, so the number of ones and twos in the segment remains the same. However, the positions of the ones and twos change.\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed reversal [l, r], we can compute:\n\n            For s < l:\n                B[0..s] = A[0..s] (unchanged)\n\n            For s >= l and s < r:\n                B[0..s] is a mix of the unchanged prefix and the reversed segment.\n\n            For s >= r:\n                B[0..s] includes the reversed segment and the unchanged part from r+1 to s.\n\n        Actually, we can break the array into three parts:\n\n            Part1: [0, l-1] (unchanged)\n            Part2: [l, r] (reversed)\n            Part3: [r+1, n-1] (unchanged)\n\n        Then for a given s:\n\n            If s < l:\n                left_ones(s) = pre_ones[s+1]   (since pre_ones[s+1] counts from 0 to s)\n\n            If s >= l and s < r:\n                Then the segment [0, s] includes:\n                    [0, l-1]: pre_ones[s+1] for the unchanged part [0, l-1] is pre_ones[l] (if we define pre_ones[i] as the count from 0 to i-1, then the count from 0 to l-1 is pre_ones[l])\n                    [l, s]: this is the first part of the reversed segment.\n\n                But wait, we don't have the reversed segment stored. We need to know the ones in the reversed part from l to s.\n\n                Let seg_ones = the multiset of the reversed segment [l, r] (which is the same as the multiset of A[l..r]). But we need to know the actual arrangement.\n\n                Alternatively, we can precompute the entire array's prefix sums and then adjust for the reversed segment.\n\n        This seems messy.\n\n   Another idea: Instead of iterating over every reversal and then over every s, can we precompute the effect of the reversal on the entire array's prefix sums?\n\n   Note: the reversal operation swaps the positions of the ones and twos within [l, r] but without changing the multiset.\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n        Let f(s) = (# of 1's in A[0..s]) + (# of 2's in A[s+1..n-1])\n\n        Then without reversal, the answer for the original array is max_{s} f(s).\n\n        But with reversal, we are effectively swapping some 1's and 2's in the segment [l, r]. \n\n        Specifically, in the segment [l, r], the ones and twos are swapped. \n\n        Then for a given s, we can compute the new array B by:\n\n            For i in [0, l-1]: same as A.\n            For i in [l, r]: the element at position i in B is the element at position (l+r-i) in A.\n            For i in [r+1, n-1]: same as A.\n\n        Then the count of ones in B[0..s] is:\n\n            = (# of ones in A[0..s]) \n              - (# of ones in A[l..min(s, r)] )   [because in the reversed segment, the ones in the original A[l..min(s, r)] become twos, and the twos in A[l..min(s, r)] become ones? Actually, no: the entire segment [l, r] is reversed, so the element originally at position l goes to r, and so on.\n\n        Actually, we need to know the entire mapping. \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that the reversal operation swaps the positions of the ones and twos in [l, r]. \n\n        Then the new array B is:\n\n            For i < l or i > r: B[i] = A[i]\n            For i in [l, r]: B[i] = 3 - A[i]   (since 1 becomes 2 and 2 becomes 1)\n\n        Then the count of ones in B[0..s] is:\n\n            = (# of ones in A[0..s]) \n              - (# of ones in A[l..min(s, r)]) + (# of twos in A[l..min(s, r)])\n\n        Similarly, the count of twos in B[0..s] is:\n\n            = (# of twos in A[0..s]) \n              - (# of twos in A[l..min(s, r)]) + (# of ones in A[l..min(s, r)])\n\n        Then the candidate(s) for B is:\n\n            candidate(s) = (# of ones in B[0..s]) + (# of twos in B[s+1..n-1])\n\n        But note: the part [s+1..n-1] also might include the reversed segment if s < r.\n\n        This becomes very complicated.\n\n   Given the complexity, perhaps we can try a different approach.\n\n   Let me consider: what is the maximum LNDS we can achieve?\n\n   We can achieve at most n, if we can make the entire sequence non-decreasing (all 1's then all 2's). \n\n   When can we achieve n? \n        We can achieve n if there exists a reversal [l, r] such that after reversal, the entire sequence is non-decreasing.\n\n        That means: \n            For all i from 0 to l-2: A[i] == 1 (or at least, the subsequence we take must be non-decreasing, but the entire sequence doesn't have to be non-decreasing, but we can take the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing).\n\n        Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no '2' followed by a '1'.\n\n        After reversal, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if:\n\n            - The left part (if any) is all 1's (if we are going to put 1's at the beginning) and then the reversed part becomes all 1's then all 2's, and the right part is all 2's.\n\n        But note: the reversal of a segment that is not itself non-decreasing might break the global non-decreasing property.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider that the reversal operation can only fix the inversion within the segment and the boundaries. \n\n   However, note that the reversal operation might not fix the entire sequence. \n\n   But the problem is: we wish to maximize the LNDS, not necessarily to make the entire sequence non-decreasing.\n\n   And we already argued that the LNDS is the maximum candidate(s) = (# of 1's in B[0..s]) + (# of 2's in B[s+1..n-1]) for some s.\n\n   And note: the entire array has total_ones and total_twos, and the maximum candidate(s) is at most total_ones+total_twos.\n\n   How to compute candidate(s) for a given reversal [l, r] without iterating over every s?\n\n   We can precompute for the original array A:\n\n        Let P(i) = (# of 1's in A[0..i-1])   [prefix sum of ones]\n\n        Let Q(i) = (# of 2's in A[0..i-1])\n\n        Then for the original array, the candidate for s is: P(s+1) + (n - s - 1 - (Q(s+1) - (number of 2's in the prefix up to s))) -> wait, no.\n\n        Actually, for the original array, the candidate for s is:\n            ones in [0..s] = P(s+1)\n            twos in [s+1..n-1] = total_twos - (number of 2's in [0..s]) = total_twos - (Q(s+1))\n\n        So candidate_original(s) = P(s+1) + (total_twos - Q(s+1))\n\n   Now, for a reversal [l, r]:\n\n        Let T = the multiset of the segment [l, r] in A: let ones_seg = number of 1's in A[l..r], twos_seg = number of 2's in A[l..r] (and ones_seg+twos_seg = length of segment).\n\n        After reversal, the segment [l, r] is fixed, and the ones and twos are swapped: the number of 1's in the segment becomes twos_seg, and the number of 2's becomes ones_seg.\n\n        Then, for a given s:\n\n            Case 1: s < l.\n                The prefix [0..s] is unchanged.\n                candidate(s) = P(s+1) + (total_twos - (Q(s+1)))\n\n            Case 2: s >= l and s < r.\n                The prefix [0..s] is composed of:\n                    [0, l-1]: unchanged, so ones_count1 = P(l), twos_count1 = Q(l)\n                    [l, s]: this is the reversed segment from l to s. In the reversed segment, the element at position i (which is in [l, s]) originally was at position (l + r - i) in A. But we can also compute the ones and twos in the reversed part [l, s] by knowing the original part [l, s]",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence can be maximized by ensuring as many 1s as possible appear before any 2s in the sequence. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is simply the maximum number of elements we can pick such that all selected 1s come before any selected 2s. This means the optimal solution involves partitioning the sequence into a segment of 1s followed by a segment of 2s.\n2. **Insight**: The reversal of any contiguous subarray can help in rearranging the sequence to bring more 1s to the front and 2s to the back. The goal is to find the reversal that maximizes the count of 1s before any 2s.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sums**: Precompute prefix sums for the counts of 1s and 2s up to each index in the original array. This helps in quickly calculating the number of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each possible reversal (defined by start and end indices), compute the effect on the prefix sums. Specifically, adjust the counts of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment and then determine the best partition point (s) where the sum of 1s before s and 2s after s is maximized.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over all possible O(n^2) reversals. For each reversal, it computes the adjusted prefix sums in O(1) time using precomputed values. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for x in arr if x == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    pre_ones = [0] * (n+1)\n    pre_twos = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        pre_ones[i] = pre_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        pre_twos[i] = pre_twos[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    max_ans = 0\n    \n    for l in range(n):\n        seg_ones = 0\n        seg_twos = 0\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if arr[l] == 1:\n                seg_ones += 1\n            else:\n                seg_twos += 1\n                \n            if arr[r] == 1:\n                seg_ones += 1\n            else:\n                seg_twos += 1\n                \n            ones_left = pre_ones[l]\n            twos_left = pre_twos[l]\n            \n            len_seg = r - l + 1\n            ones_in_seg_after_rev = seg_twos\n            twos_in_seg_after_rev = seg_ones\n            \n            if l > 0:\n                ones_left += ones_in_seg_after_rev\n                twos_left += twos_in_seg_after_rev\n            else:\n                ones_left = ones_in_seg_after_rev\n                twos_left = twos_in_seg_after_rev\n                \n            ones_right = total_ones - ones_left\n            twos_right = total_twos - (pre_twos[r+1] - twos_left)\n            \n            candidate = ones_left + twos_right\n            if candidate > max_ans:\n                max_ans = candidate\n                \n    print(max_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the sequence) followed by the sequence itself.\n2. **Prefix Arrays**: Two prefix arrays, `pre_ones` and `pre_twos`, are computed to store the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s up to each index in the original array.\n3. **Sliding Window for Reversals**: For each possible starting index `l` of the reversal, the algorithm iterates over all ending indices `r >= l`. It dynamically updates the counts of 1s and 2s in the current segment `[l, r]`.\n4. **Adjusted Counts**: After reversing the segment `[l, r]`, the counts of 1s and 2s in this segment are swapped. The algorithm then calculates the total number of 1s before any partition point `s` and the total number of 2s after `s`, aiming to maximize their sum.\n5. **Output**: The maximum value of the sum (number of 1s before `s` plus number of 2s after `s`) across all possible reversals is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible reversals and leverages prefix sums to quickly compute the necessary counts, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
