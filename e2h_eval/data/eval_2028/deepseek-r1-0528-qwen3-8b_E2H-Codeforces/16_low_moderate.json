Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border (of nonzero length). \n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing one or more roads. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n We start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (but note: moving from one block to another requires crossing a contiguous segment of a road, so actually we can only cross one road at a time? But wait: the problem says \"in one step\" you can move from one block to another if the common border has nonzero length. This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a part of a road (so they differ by exactly one road). \n\n However, consider: if two blocks are separated by k roads, then we need to cross all k roads. But note: the movement rule says we can only cross one road per step? Actually, no: the step condition is about having a common border. The common border between two blocks is a segment of one of the roads. So to go from one block to a non-adjacent block (separated by two roads) we must first cross one road and then the other. Therefore, the minimum number of steps is the number of distinct roads that separate the home block from the university block.\n\n But wait: the problem does not require that we actually cross each road individually. However, note that the entire plane is divided by the roads. The home and university are in two different blocks. The set of roads that we must cross to get from home to university is exactly the set of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: the movement condition: we can only move through a common border (nonzero length). This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a common road segment. And two blocks are separated by a set of roads. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of road crossings? Actually, each step crosses one road. But wait: if we cross multiple roads at an intersection, then we might be able to cross several at once? However, the problem states that we can only move if the common border is nonzero. This implies that we can only cross one road at a time (because if two roads meet at an intersection, then the common border between two adjacent blocks is just the half-line of the road beyond that intersection, and we cannot jump from one block to a block that is separated by two roads without first crossing one of them).\n\n Therefore, we can think of the problem as: we have a set of roads. For each road, we check whether home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, then we must cross that road. Each crossing (step) corresponds to crossing one road. However, note that when we cross a road, we enter a new block. Then to cross another road we must take another step.\n\n But wait: is it possible to cross two roads in one step? According to the problem, the step requires a nonzero common border. Two blocks that are separated by two roads do not share a common border (because the common border would have to be a part of one of the roads, but the two roads are distinct). Therefore, we must cross one road at a time.\n\n Hence, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate home and university.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if the home and university are in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road, so steps=0.\n\n But wait: the example inputs:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n     1 1\n     -1 -1\n     2\n     0 1 0\n     1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n     1 1\n     -1 -1\n     3\n     1 0 0\n     0 1 0\n     1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n How do we explain?\n\n Let's analyze Example 1:\n\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  => y = 0 (the x-axis)\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  => x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n   Now, we have two roads. They divide the plane into 4 quadrants.\n\n   Home (1,1) is in the first quadrant.\n   University (-1,-1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key insight is that each road must be crossed exactly once if the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads separate the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by a linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For each road, we determine whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides of the road.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate them. A road separates the two points if they lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and thus must be crossed, incrementing the step count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    steps = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (value1 < 0 and value2 > 0) or (value1 > 0 and value2 < 0):\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are extracted. These coefficients define the line equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\).\n3. **Determining Separation**: For each road, the code checks the sign of the equation evaluated at the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, it means the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed, incrementing the step count.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of such roads (steps) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of roads, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
