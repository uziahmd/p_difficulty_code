The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (odd/even) of the numbers because the condition is about the sum being odd.\n Condition: a_i + b_j is odd => one must be even and the other odd.\n\n So, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes (a_i): \n        Group 0 (even): even numbers\n        Group 1 (odd): odd numbers\n\n   Keys (b_j):\n        Group 0 (even): even numbers\n        Group 1 (odd): odd numbers\n\n Then, note that an even chest can be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two types of pairs:\n   - Even chest with odd key.\n   - Odd chest with even key.\n\n But note: one key or chest can be used only once.\n\n However, the problem now becomes: we have two bipartite graphs (actually independent) but wait, we can use keys only once.\n\n Actually, the two types of pairs are independent? Let's see:\n\n   We have:\n      Chest0 (even) requires Key1 (odd)\n      Chest1 (odd) requires Key0 (even)\n\n And we cannot use the same key for two different chests.\n\n But note: the keys and chests are separated by two independent matching conditions.\n\n However, we can think of it as:\n\n   Total matching = matching from even_chests to odd_keys + matching from odd_chests to even_keys.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: the sets of keys are fixed. The odd_keys are used for even_chests and the even_keys for odd_chests.\n\n However, the entire set of keys is fixed. So we have:\n\n   Let:\n     even_chest_count = number of even a_i\n     odd_chest_count = number of odd a_i\n\n     even_key_count = number of even b_j\n     odd_key_count = number of odd b_j\n\n Now, the matching for even_chests to odd_keys is limited by both the number of even_chests and the number of odd_keys.\n Similarly, for odd_chests to even_keys is limited by both the number of odd_chests and the number of even_keys.\n\n However, note: the keys are shared in the sense that we cannot use an odd key for an odd chest (because odd+odd=even, which is not odd).\n Similarly, we cannot use an even key for an even chest (even+even=even).\n\n So the two matchings are independent. But wait, what if we have more than one way to assign? Actually, we are just counting the maximum possible.\n\n But note: the entire set of keys is given and we are not allowed to use a key twice.\n\n However, we can model this as two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph1: even_chests (left) and odd_keys (right) -> maximum matching is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) but wait, no: actually, we have all the even_chests and all the odd_keys available, but we are constrained by the counts? Actually, the condition is that we can use each key only once. But note: we are only concerned with the total counts because the matching in a complete bipartite graph between two sets is the minimum of the two set sizes? \n\n Actually, we don't need to form a complete matching because we have two separate requirements. However, the catch is that the same key cannot be used in two different matchings.\n\n But observe: the two matchings use disjoint sets of keys (one uses odd_keys and the other uses even_keys). Therefore, the two matchings are independent.\n\n So the answer would be: \n   matching1 = min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count)\n   matching2 = min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count)\n\n Then total matching = matching1 + matching2.\n\n However, let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        even_chest_count = 3, odd_chest_count = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        even_key_count = 3, odd_key_count = 1\n\n   Then matching1 = min(3, 1) = 1 (for even_chests to odd_keys)\n   matching2 = min(2, 3) = 2 (for odd_chests to even_keys)\n\n   Total = 1 + 2 = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This condition implies that one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair consists of one even and one odd number. The solution involves counting the number of even and odd numbers in both the chests and keys.\n2. **Intuition**: Chestes with even numbers can only be opened by keys with odd numbers, and vice versa. Therefore, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for even chests with odd keys and for odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves linear scans of the input lists to count even and odd numbers, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n            \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n            \n    match1 = min(even_chest, odd_key)\n    match2 = min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    \n    print(match1 + match2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: The code counts how many chests and keys have even or odd numbers by checking each number's parity.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of these two maxima gives the total number of chests Neko can open, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
