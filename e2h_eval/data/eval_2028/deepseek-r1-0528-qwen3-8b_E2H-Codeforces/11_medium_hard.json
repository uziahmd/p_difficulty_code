A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n But the group has:\n   - Total drink: k * l milliliters\n   - Total lime slices: c * d\n   - Total salt: p grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same amount, we need to consider the entire group.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total available resources for the entire group? Actually, we can calculate the maximum toasts that can be made by the entire group, but note that each toast requires one slice of lime (so the lime is per toast) and the drink and salt are also per toast.\n\n However, note: the requirement is per toast for one friend. So for t toasts per friend, the entire group (n friends) will have t*n toasts.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. Therefore, for one toast, the entire group would require n times the drink and salt? \n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs ... for a toast\". So if there are n friends, then for one toast (per friend) we need n times the drink? Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. That means each friend drinks nl ml. Therefore, for one toast (one round of drinking) each friend drinks nl ml, so the total drink consumed in one round (one toast) is n * nl.\n\n Similarly, for one toast (one round) the total salt needed is n * np.\n\n But note: the problem says they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. Each toast is one round.\n\n So let's break down:\n\n For the drink: total available = k * l\n   Number of full rounds (toasts) that can be made based on drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n For the salt: total available = p\n   Number of full rounds (toasts) that can be made based on salt = p // (n * np)\n\n For the lime: total available = c * d\n   Each toast (round) requires one slice per friend? Wait, note: the requirement says \"a slice of lime\" for each toast. But per friend? Or for the entire group?\n\n Let me look again: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So each friend gets one slice per toast. Therefore, for one toast (round) the entire group (n friends) requires n slices.\n\n So the number of toasts (rounds) that can be made based on limes = (c * d) // (n * 1)   [because each toast uses n slices]\n\n Then the overall number of toasts (rounds) that can be made is the minimum of these three:\n\n   T_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n   T_salt = p // (n * np)\n   T_lime = (c * d) // (n)\n\n Then, the answer is T_rounds = min(T_drink, T_salt, T_lime)\n\n However, wait: the example input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\n Let's compute for the example:\n\n   n=3, k=4, l=5 -> total drink = 20\n   n*nl = 3*3 = 9 -> T_drink = 20 // 9 = 2\n\n   p=100, n*np = 3*1 = 3 -> T_salt = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n   c=10, d=8 -> total lime slices = 80, n=3 -> T_lime = 80 // 3 = 26\n\n   Then T_rounds = min(2, 33, 26) = 2.\n\n But the sample output is 2.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"each friend can make [answer] toasts\"\n\n In the example, the entire group makes 2 toasts (rounds). But each friend makes 2 toasts (since each toast is one round, and each round they drink once). \n\n But wait: the example calculation in the note says: \n   \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n Why 6 toasts? Because the note is considering the drink for the entire group? Actually, the note says: \n   \"The drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" \n   Then the limes: 80 toasts, salt: 100 toasts.\n\n But wait, the note then says: \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6,80,100)/3 = 2\"\n\n This interpretation is different: they are calculating the total number of individual toasts (without grouping) and then dividing by the number of friends.\n\n Explanation from the note:\n\n   They are making toasts (individual servings) and each toast is defined as one serving for one friend.\n\n   So for the drink: each toast (for one friend) requires nl milliliters. But the drink is shared. However, the note does not multiply by n for the drink.\n\n   Actually, the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20/3 toasts\", meaning that if we think of the drink as being used for individual servings (each requiring 3 ml) then we can have 6 servings (each serving being one toast for one friend). Then because there are 3 friends, we can only have 6 / 3 = 2 rounds (toasts per friend) because each round one friend gets one serving.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   Each toast (for the entire group) is defined by the condition that each friend gets one toast. But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. So if we are doing t toasts per friend, then:\n\n     Drink required: t * (nl) * n   [because each of the n friends gets t * nl ml]\n     Lime required: t * n   [because each of the n friends gets t slices (one per toast)]\n     Salt required: t * (np) * n\n\n However, this would be the same as the above calculation for the entire group for t rounds.\n\n But note: the example calculation in the note does:\n\n     Drink: 20 ml, and each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml -> so 20/3 = 6 toasts (if we were just counting individual servings). Then we divide by 3 (number of friends) to get 2.\n\n However, that method is equivalent to:\n\n     Total toasts (individual servings) that can be made from drink: (k*l) // nl\n     From limes: (c*d) // 1   [because each toast (individual) requires one lime slice?]\n     From salt: p // np\n\n Then the limiting factor is the minimum of these three, and then we must ensure that the number of toasts per friend is an integer and that we cannot exceed the individual resource constraints.\n\n But wait: the note says: \"min(6,80,100)\" and then divides by 3.\n\n However, note: the lime requirement per individual toast is 1 slice. And the drink requirement per individual toast is nl ml, and salt is np grams.\n\n But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n This implies that one toast (for one friend) uses nl ml, 1 slice, and np grams.\n\n Now, if we consider the entire group: they are making the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then:\n\n   Drink: t * n * nl <= k * l\n   Lime: t * n * 1 <= c * d\n   Salt: t * n * np <= p\n\n Therefore, t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n        t <= (c*d) / (n)\n        t <= p / (n*np)\n\n So the maximum t (toasts per friend) is the floor of the minimum of these three.\n\n But wait: the example using this formula:\n\n   t <= (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 -> floor is 2\n   t <= (10*8) / 3 = 80/3 -> floor is 26\n   t <= 100/(3*1) = 100/3 -> floor is 33\n\n Then t_max = 2.\n\n However, the note's method:\n\n   Individual drink servings: (k*l) // nl = 20//3 = 6 (if we don't account for multiple friends)\n   Individual lime servings: (c*d) // 1 = 80\n   Individual salt servings: p // np = 100//1 = 100\n\n Then the total individual servings is 6 (from drink), and then we have 6 servings. But since there are 3 friends, we can only do 6 / 3 = 2 rounds (each round each friend gets one serving).\n\n This matches.\n\n But note: the condition for drink in the note is per toast (for one friend) so the drink constraint is 3 ml per toast. The total drink is 20 ml, so 20/3 = 6.66... -> 6 toasts (individual) can be made from the drink.\n\n However, the condition for the entire group is that each friend must get the same number of toasts. So we cannot use the drink to make 6 toasts if the number of toasts per friend is not an integer? Actually, we are going to round down the total toasts (individual) to the nearest integer, and then divide by n (the number of friends) and take the floor.\n\n But note: the two methods are equivalent:\n\n   Method 1 (by resources per friend):\n      t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n\n   Method 2 (by total individual servings and then grouping):\n      total_individual_drink = (k*l) // nl\n      total_individual_salt = p // np\n      total_individual_lime = (c*d) // 1   [but wait, lime is one per toast (per friend)]\n\n      Then the total toasts (individual) is limited by the most scarce resource, say T = min(total_individual_drink, total_individual_salt, total_individual_lime)\n\n      Then, since each friend must get the same number of toasts, we can only have T_rounds = T // n   (because T is the total number of individual servings, and each round (one toast per friend) uses n servings)\n\n      But note: the drink and salt in the second method are calculated without considering the grouping. However, the requirement is that the entire group must have the same number of toasts. So we cannot have fractional rounds.\n\n   Example with method 2:\n\n        total_individual_drink = 20 // 3 = 6\n        total_individual_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n        total_individual_lime = 80 // 1 = 80\n\n        Then T = min(6,100,80)=6\n\n        Then T_rounds = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   But wait, is the lime constraint correctly applied in the second method? In the second method, we are counting the lime slices: each toast (individual) requires one slice. So the total number of individual toasts (slices) we can have is 80. Then we are limiting by the drink to 6 toasts (individual). Then we divide by 3 (number of friends) to get 2 toasts per friend.\n\n   However, note that in the first method we did:\n\n        Drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 2\n        Lime: (c*d) // (n) = 80 // 3 = 26\n        Salt: p // (n*np) = 100 // (3*1) = 33\n\n        Then t = 2.\n\n   Both methods give 2.\n\n   But which one is correct? They are two ways to look at it.\n\n   Actually, the first method (method 1) is more direct: we are calculating the maximum number of toasts per friend (t) such that:\n\n        n * t * nl <= k * l\n        n * t * 1 <= c * d\n        n * t * np <= p\n\n   Then t = min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/(n*1), p/(n*np) ) and then take the floor (because t must be integer).\n\n   The second method (method 2) calculates the total individual servings (each toast is one serving for one friend) that can be provided by each resource:\n\n        Drink: total_serving_drink = (k*l) // nl\n        Lime: total_serving_lime = (c*d) // 1\n        Salt: total_serving_salt = p // np\n\n   Then the total number of individual servings we can have is the minimum of these three.\n\n        total_individual_servings = min(total_serving_drink, total_serving_lime, total_serving_salt)\n\n   Then, since each friend must have the same number of servings, the number of servings per friend is:\n\n        servings_per_friend = total_individual_servings // n\n\n   However, wait: the drink and salt in the second method are calculated as if the entire drink can be used for any friend, but note that the drink requirement per individual serving is nl. The first method uses n*nl per round (which is the same as the drink requirement for one round of n friends).\n\n   But note: the second method counts the drink servings as (k*l) // nl, which is the maximum number of individual servings (each requiring nl) that can be made. Similarly, the salt servings are (p) // np. And the lime servings are (c*d) // 1.\n\n   Then the total_individual_servings is the maximum number of toasts (each toast being one serving for one friend) that can be made without regard to the fact that the entire group must have the same number. Then we divide by n to get the number of rounds (toasts per friend) because each round (toast) for the entire group requires n servings.\n\n   But note: we might have leftovers. However, the problem says they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So if we have 6 servings (from drink) and 3 friends, then we can have 2 rounds (each round uses 3 servings). But if we had 7 servings, then we could only have 2 rounds (because 7//3 = 2, and 3*2=6 servings used, leaving 1 unused).\n\n   Therefore, both methods are equivalent.\n\n   However, let me check with the other example: \n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        Expected output: 3\n\n   Using method 1:\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        Drink: (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n        Lime: (1*19) // 5 = 19//5 = 3 (floor division)\n        Salt: 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n        Then t = min(50, 3, 6) = 3.\n\n   Using method 2:\n\n        Drink: (100*10) // 4 = 1000 //4 = 250\n        Lime: (1*19) // 1 = 19\n        Salt: 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        total_individual_servings = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n        servings_per_friend = 19 // 5 = 3\n\n   So both methods yield 3.\n\n   Another example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n        Expected output: 0\n\n   Using method 1:\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        Drink: (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n        Lime: (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n        Salt: 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n        t = min(2000,57,0) = 0.\n\n   Using method 2:\n\n        Drink: (1000*1000) // 50 = 20000\n        Lime: (25*23) // 1 = 575\n        Salt: 1 // 1 = 1\n\n        total_individual_servings = min(20000,575,1) = 1\n        servings_per_friend = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n   So both methods work.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and not less than 1. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n But wait: what if n is 1? Then the calculation is the same.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We can use either method. Let me choose method 1 because it directly computes the constraint per friend.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read the input line and split into 8 integers.\n\n        Let the list be: tokens = [n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np]\n\n        Then:\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime_slices = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            # Constraints for t toasts per friend:\n            #   Drink: t <= total_drink / (n * nl)\n            #   Lime: t <= total_lime_slices / n\n            #   Salt: t <= total_salt / (n * np)\n\n            t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)   # floor division\n            t_lime = total_lime_slices // n       # floor division: because we need n slices per round (each round for one toast per friend)\n            t_salt = total_salt // (n * np)       # floor division\n\n            answer = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", and the constraints must hold. Since we are using floor division, we are taking the maximum integer t that satisfies all constraints.\n\n   But wait: the constraints are linear and we are using integer division (floor). This gives the maximum integer t such that:\n\n        n * t * nl <= k * l\n        n * t <= c * d\n        n * t * np <= p\n\n   However, note that the drink and salt constraints are not necessarily multiples of n*nl and n*np? We are using floor division which is safe because we cannot use fractional toasts.\n\n   But note: the example with drink: (k*l) might not be divisible by (n*nl). Floor division gives the maximum integer t such that n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n   Example: k*l=20, n=3, nl=3 -> 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2, and 3*2*3=18<=20, but 3*3*3=27>20 -> so 2 is correct.\n\n   Similarly for the others.\n\n   However, note that the lime constraint: we are doing total_lime_slices // n, which is the same as (c*d) // n. But if (c*d) is not divisible by n, then we are rounding down. This is correct because we cannot use a fraction of a toast.\n\n   Example: n=3, c*d=8 -> 8//3=2, and then we can have 2 rounds (using 6 slices) and we have 2 slices left over. But we cannot have 3 rounds because that would require 9 slices (which we don't have). So 2 is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if len(data) != 8:\n            # But the problem says one line with 8 integers, so we assume 8.\n            # However, if there's an error, we can try to handle.\n            # But the problem says exactly one line with 8 numbers.\n            pass\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, data)\n\n        # Calculate the maximum toasts per friend (t) from each resource\n        # Drink: t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n        # Lime: t <= (c * d) / n\n        # Salt: t <= p / (n * np)\n\n        # Use integer floor division\n        drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl) if (n * nl) != 0 else 0\n        lime_limit = (c * d) // n if n != 0 else 0\n        salt_limit = p // (n * np) if (n * np) != 0 else 0\n\n        # But note: the problem states that the numbers are at least 1, so n, nl, np are at least 1, so denominators are at least 1. So we don't need the if conditions for zero, but including for safety.\n\n        answer = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n        print(answer)\n\n   However, wait: the example input order is: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n   But note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n   Our calculation:\n\n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n        drink_limit = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n        lime_limit = (10*8) // 3 = 80//3 = 26\n        salt_limit = 100 // (3*1) = 100//3 = 33\n\n        min(2,26,33)=2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait: the example note says the drink calculation was 20/3=6 (which is the total individual servings) and then divided by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. So our method 1 is actually the same as the note's method 2 but without explicitly calculating the individual servings.\n\n   We'll go with method 1.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and no less than 1. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n   But let me write the code without the conditionals (since n, nl, np are at least 1):\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n        drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n        salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n        print(min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit))\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> Output: 2\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> Output: 3\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> Output: 0\n\n   But wait, example 3: \n        drink_limit = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n        lime_limit = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n        salt_limit = 1 // (10*1) = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n   So min(2000,57,0) = 0 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example input in the problem is given as a list of strings. But the problem says the input is one line.\n\n   We are reading one line.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n   This is just a list of example inputs, but the actual input is one line.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n        drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n        salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n        print(min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit))\n\n   However, wait: the example note says the drink constraint is 20/3 (which is 6.66..., then floor to 6) and then divide by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. But our method 1 does not use that division. \n\n   But note: our method 1 is:\n\n        Drink: total_drink = k*l = 20, and we require for one round (one toast per friend): n * nl = 3*3=9 ml. Then 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n   This is the same as the note's method 2: total_individual_servings = 20 // 3 = 6, then 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   But wait, the drink in method 1 is calculated as (k*l) // (n*nl) which is the same as (k*l) // (nl * n) and that is the same as (k*l // nl) // n? Not exactly, because:\n\n        (k*l) // (n*nl)  vs. ((k*l) // nl) // n\n\n   Example: k*l=20, n=3, nl=3.\n\n        Method 1: 20 // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        Method 2: (20//3) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2\n\n   Example2: k*l=1000, n=5, nl=4 -> drink requirement per round: 5*4=20\n\n        Method1: 1000 // 20 = 50\n        Method2: (1000//4) //5 = 250//5 = 50\n\n   Why is that? Because (k*l) = n * nl * t + remainder, and (k*l)//nl is at least n*t (if the remainder is nonnegative) and then (k*l)//nl // n >= t? \n\n   Actually, we have:\n\n        t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        => n*nl*t <= k*l\n\n        => (k*l) // (n*nl) >= t   [if we use floor division]\n\n   But note: the drink constraint in method 2 is:\n\n        total_individual_servings = (k*l) // nl   [maximum individual servings from drink]\n\n        Then the maximum rounds (toasts per friend) is total_individual_servings // n.\n\n        But note: total_individual_servings = (k*l) // nl  => (k*l) // nl >= (n*t)   [if we use integer division, but actually the real value is (k*l) >= n*t*nl, then (k*l)//nl >= n*t]\n\n        Then (k*l)//nl // n >= t? \n\n        Example: k*l=20, n=3, nl=3 -> (k*l)//nl = 6, then 6//3=2, which equals t.\n\n        But what if (k*l) is 21? Then:\n\n            Method1: 21 // (3*3) = 21//9 = 2\n            Method2: (21//3)=7, then 7//3=2.\n\n        What if (k*l)=19? Then:\n\n            Method1: 19//9=2\n            Method2: 19//3=6, then 6//3=2.\n\n        What if (k*l)=8? Then:\n\n            Method1: 8//9=0\n            Method2: 8//3=2, then 2//3=0.\n\n        So both methods yield the same result.\n\n        Why? Because:\n\n            t = min( (k*l)//(n*nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) )\n\n        and\n\n            t_alt = min( (k*l)//nl // n, (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) )   [but wait, the lime and salt in method2 are the same as method1? No, the lime is the same, but the drink in method2 is (k*l)//nl // n, and the salt is p//np // n? Actually, no: in method2, the salt is p//np (total individual servings) then divided by n.\n\n        But wait, the problem states that for salt, each toast (individual) requires np grams. So the total individual servings from salt is p // np. Then the rounds per friend is (p // np) // n.\n\n        However, note: the salt constraint in method1 is p // (n*np). \n\n        These two are not the same:\n\n            (p // np) // n   vs.   p // (n*np)\n\n        Example: p=10, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 10 // (2*3) = 10//6 = 1\n            Method2: (10//3) //2 = 3//2 = 1\n\n        Example: p=11, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 11//6 = 1\n            Method2: (11//3)=3, then 3//2=1\n\n        Example: p=5, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 5//6=0\n            Method2: (5//3)=1, then 1//2=0\n\n        Example: p=6, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 6//6=1\n            Method2: (6//3)=2, then 2//2=1\n\n        Example: p=7, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 7//6=1\n            Method2: (7//3)=2, then 2//2=1\n\n        Example: p=8, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 8//6=1\n            Method2: (8//3)=2, then 2//2=1\n\n        Example: p=9, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 9//6=1\n            Method2: (9//3)=3, then 3//2=1\n\n        Example: p=10, n=2, np=3 -> same as above.\n\n        Example: p=12, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 12//6=2\n            Method2: (12//3)=4, then 4//2=2\n\n        So it appears that:\n\n            p // (n*np) = (p // np) // n   ?\n\n        But wait: \n\n            p // (n*np) is the same as (p // np) // n only when p is divisible by np and n? \n\n        Actually, the relationship between floor divisions is not always distributive.\n\n        Consider: p=13, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 13 // 6 = 2\n            Method2: (13//3)=4, then 4//2=2.\n\n        Consider: p=14, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 14//6=2\n            Method2: 14//3=4, 4//2=2.\n\n        Consider: p=15, n=2, np=3\n\n            Method1: 15//6=2\n            Method2: 15//3=5, 5//2=2.\n\n        Now consider: p=5, n=2, np=3: both 0.\n\n        Actually, we can prove that:\n\n            p // (n * np) = floor(p / (n * np))\n\n            and \n\n            floor(floor(p / np) / n) = ?\n\n        But note: \n\n            floor(p / (n*np)) = floor( (p) / (n*np) )\n\n            floor(floor(p / np) / n) = floor( (floor(p / np)) / n )\n\n        And we know that:\n\n            floor(p / (n*np)) <= floor( floor(p / np) / n )\n\n        Why? \n\n            p / (n*np) = (p / np) / n\n\n            Then floor( (p / np) / n ) >= floor(p / (n*np))? \n\n        Example: p=13, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(13/(2*3)) = floor(13/6) = 2\n            floor(13/3)=4, then floor(4/2)=2.\n\n        Example: p=1, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(1/6)=0\n            floor(1/3)=0, then floor(0/2)=0.\n\n        Example: p=4, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(4/6)=0\n            floor(4/3)=1, then floor(1/2)=0.\n\n        Example: p=6, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(6/6)=1\n            floor(6/3)=2, then floor(2/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=7, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(7/6)=1\n            floor(7/3)=2, then floor(2/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=8, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(8/6)=1\n            floor(8/3)=2, then floor(2/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=9, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(9/6)=1\n            floor(9/3)=3, then floor(3/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=10, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(10/6)=1\n            floor(10/3)=3, then floor(3/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=11, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(11/6)=1\n            floor(11/3)=3, then floor(3/2)=1.\n\n        Example: p=12, np=3, n=2:\n\n            floor(12/6)=2\n            floor(12/3)=4, then floor(4/2)=2.\n\n        Example: p=13, np=3, n=2: already done.\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            floor(floor(p / np) / n) <= floor(p / (n*np)) ?\n\n        Wait, let me check: p=13, np=3, n=2: both are 2.\n\n        p=5, np=3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends consume the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three constraints: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast for a friend requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - One lime slice.\n   - `np` grams of salt.\n   \n   The resources available are:\n   - `k` bottles of `l` milliliters each (total drink = `k * l`).\n   - `c` limes each cut into `d` slices (total lime slices = `c * d`).\n   - `p` grams of salt.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each friend to make `t` toasts, the total resources required must satisfy:\n   - Drink: `n * t * nl <= k * l`\n   - Lime: `n * t <= c * d`\n   - Salt: `n * t * np <= p`\n   \n   The maximum number of toasts per friend (`t`) is the minimum value derived from these three constraints, considering integer division (since partial toasts are not allowed).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Calculate the maximum toasts based on each resource:\n     - **Drink Constraint**: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`\n     - **Lime Constraint**: `(c * d) // n`\n     - **Salt Constraint**: `p // (n * np)`\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n    drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n    salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n    print(min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, and the required drink and salt per toast.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Total available drink divided by the drink required per friend per toast, adjusted for the number of friends.\n   - **Lime Limit**: Total available lime slices divided by the number of friends (since each toast per friend requires one slice).\n   - **Salt Limit**: Total available salt divided by the salt required per friend per toast, adjusted for the number of friends.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The minimum of these three calculated limits gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource constraints. This result is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal, leveraging simple arithmetic operations to derive the answer.",
