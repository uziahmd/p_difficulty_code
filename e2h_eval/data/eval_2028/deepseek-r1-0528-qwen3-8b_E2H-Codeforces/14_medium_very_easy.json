He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n The function to count trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the same m may not be achieved by consecutive n. In fact, Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. But note that sometimes Z(n) stays the same for consecutive numbers until a multiple of 5 is reached.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, we are looking for n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n such that the factorial ends with exactly m zeroes, and then to list those n in increasing order.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing and stepwise. That is, Z(n) remains constant for a range of n and then jumps at multiples of 5.\n\n Example: \n   m=1: \n        We know that 5! has 1 zero, but 4! has 0 zeros. Then 5! to 9! have 1 zero? Actually, 5! = 120 -> 1, 6! = 720 -> 1, 7! = 5040 -> 1, 8! = 40320 -> 1, 9! = 362880 -> 1, and 10! = 3628800 -> 2.\n\n So for m=1, the numbers n from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly one trailing zero.\n\n Therefore, the answer for m=1 is: \n        First line: 5\n        Second line: 5 6 7 8 9\n\n How to solve?\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. This is standard: we can use binary search to find the minimal n0 such that Z(n0) >= m.\n\n But note: we want Z(n)=m. However, the function Z(n) is not strictly increasing. It increases only when n is a multiple of 5, 25, etc.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let L(m) be the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Let R(m) be the largest n such that Z(n) < m+1, or equivalently, the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1 is R(m)+1.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let low = 0, high = 5*m (or something more) and binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n Then, we can also find the next jump: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1, call it n_high.\n\n Then, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is the set of integers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n However, note: what if m is very large? We must be cautious.\n\n But note the input constraint: m from 1 to 100000.\n\n However, let's test with m=0: but the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n Steps:\n\n   1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n      We'll call this lower_bound.\n\n   2. Find the upper bound: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n      We'll call this upper_bound.\n\n   3. Then, the numbers n for which Z(n)=m are the integers from lower_bound to upper_bound-1.\n\n   4. Then, the count is (upper_bound - lower_bound).\n\n   5. Print the count and then the list of numbers from lower_bound to upper_bound-1.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to list all numbers if there are too many? But note the constraints: m up to 100000, and the numbers n might be very large (like for m=100000, n would be around 400000? Actually, the formula for Z(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... which is about n/4. So for m=100000, n is about 5*m? But actually, we know that Z(5*m) is approximately m (since 5*m /5 = m, and then higher powers add more). But wait: Z(5*m) is at least m (because 5*m//5 = m, then 5*m//25 = m//5, etc.). \n\n However, the problem says: output the k integers (the numbers n). But if m is large, the numbers n might be huge and there might be many numbers (for example, when m=1, there are 5 numbers). But note: the numbers n for which Z(n)=m are consecutive. The length of the interval [lower_bound, upper_bound-1] is (upper_bound - lower_bound). \n\n But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. The maximum length of the interval is the gap between two consecutive jumps. The jumps occur at multiples of 5, 25, etc. The maximum gap is 4 (if we are just below a multiple of 5, then we get the next jump). Actually, the gap is at most 4 because Z(n) increases by the number of times 5 divides n. But the gap between two consecutive n that have the same Z(n) is at most 4. Why?\n\n Example: \n   At n=24: Z(24)=4 (because 24//5=4, 24//25=0)\n   At n=25: Z(25)=6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1, so 5+1=6)\n\n Actually, wait, that jump is 2. But note: 25 is divisible by 5^2, so we add two zeros.\n\n But the gap in terms of n is: the numbers n that have Z(n)=4 are from 20 to 24. Then at 25, Z(25)=6. So the gap from 24 to 25 is 1, and then from 25 to ... until the next jump. But note, we are looking for Z(n)=m. So for m=4, the numbers are from 20 to 24. For m=5: no n? Because Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. So m=5 is missing.\n\n Therefore, for some m, there might be no solution. Then we print:\n\n        First line: 0\n\n        And then nothing (or we don't print any numbers, but the problem says: first print k, then the k integers. So if k=0, then we just print 0 and then nothing? Actually, the problem says: \"Then print these k integers in increasing order.\" So if k=0, we just print 0.\n\n But note: the example input ['1'] outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The example input ['5'] outputs '0'.\n\n How do we know if there exists an n such that Z(n)=m?\n\n   We can check: if we found an interval [lower_bound, upper_bound-1] then we have numbers. Otherwise, if lower_bound is already beyond the point where Z(lower_bound) >= m+1 then there might be no solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Call this n_low.\n\n   Step 2: Check if Z(n_low) == m. If not, then maybe there is no n? Actually, note that Z(n) is non-decreasing. So if n_low is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, then for n_low-1, Z(n_low-1) < m. Then if Z(n_low) == m, then the numbers are from n_low to the next jump (which is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1, say n_high). Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   But if Z(n_low) != m? Actually, because Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued, the smallest n with Z(n)>=m must have Z(n_low) >= m, and since n_low is the smallest, then Z(n_low) is either m or greater than m. But if Z(n_low) > m, then there is no n such that Z(n)=m. \n\n   Example: m=5. Then the smallest n such that Z(n)>=5 is n_low = 25, because Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. Then Z(25)=6 !=5. So no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        n_low = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n        if Z(n_low) != m:\n            then there is no n, so output 0.\n\n        else:\n            n_high = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n            Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   But note: the definition of n_high is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Then the set of n with Z(n)=m is exactly the integers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   However, how to compute Z(n)? We have to write a helper function.\n\n   We can compute Z(n) by:\n\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n   Then, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n   Since m can be as large as 100000, we need to set an appropriate upper bound for the binary search.\n\n   Note: Z(n) is roughly n/4 (actually, it's less than n/4, but we can set an upper bound: we know that Z(n) >= n/5 (if we ignore higher powers, but actually we have to account for all). We can set:\n\n        n_min = 0\n        n_max = 5 * m   # This might be too low? Actually, Z(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is about m * (1/(1-1/5)) = (5/4)*m. So 5*m is enough? But wait, we are looking for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. The minimal n is at least 4*m (because Z(4*m) = (4*m)//5 + (4*m)//25 + ... which is less than m). \n\n   Actually, we can set an upper bound: we know that Z(5*m) >= m (because Z(5*m) >= (5*m)//5 = m). So we can set n_max = 5*m.\n\n   But note: sometimes we might need a higher bound? For example, if m=1, then n_max=5, and we find n_low=5. Then for m+1=2, we find n_high=10. Then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   However, for m=100000, we set n_max=500000, which is acceptable for binary search (we do about 19 iterations).\n\n   Steps:\n\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n            return count\n\n        def find_lower_bound(m):\n            lo = 0\n            hi = 5 * m   # because Z(5*m) >= m (at least m//5 * 5? Actually, Z(5*m) = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... >= m)\n            while lo < hi:\n                mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                    hi = mid\n                else:\n                    lo = mid + 1\n            return lo\n\n        Similarly, for the next bound (for m+1) we can use the same function.\n\n        Then:\n\n        n_low = find_lower_bound(m)\n        zeros_low = trailing_zeros(n_low)\n\n        if zeros_low != m:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            n_high = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n            # Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1\n            k = n_high - n_low\n            print(k)\n            # But wait, if k is 0, then we print 0 and nothing? Actually, if k==0 then the list is empty, so we should print 0 and then no numbers. But the problem says: first print k, then the k integers.\n\n            # However, if k>0, we print the numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n            # But note: the numbers are consecutive. We can generate them by:\n\n            # But if k is large, we cannot generate a list of k numbers (k can be up to 5, but wait: the gap between two consecutive jumps is at most 4, so k is at most 5? Actually, no: consider m=0, but m>=1. For m=1, k=5. For m=2, the numbers are from 10 to 14? Actually, let's check:\n\n            # For m=2: \n            #   Z(10) = 2, Z(11)=2, Z(12)=2, Z(13)=2, Z(14)=2, Z(15)=3. So k=5.\n\n            # But wait, what about m=3?\n            #   Z(15)=3, Z(16)=3, Z(17)=3, Z(18)=3, Z(19)=3, Z(20)=4 -> k=5.\n\n            # Similarly, for m=4: n from 20 to 24 -> k=5.\n\n            # Then m=5: no solution.\n\n            # Actually, the gap is always 5? Not exactly: consider m=0 (but m>=1). \n\n            # However, note that the trailing zeros function increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n. So the gap (consecutive n with the same trailing zeros) is 5 minus the multiplicity? \n\n            # Actually, the gap is the next multiple of 5. So between two multiples of 5, the trailing zeros remain constant. But when we hit a multiple of 25, then the trailing zeros increase by 2 (if we are at 25, then we add 1 from the 5 and another 1 from the 25). \n\n            # But note: the gap in n is the distance until the next multiple of 5? Actually, the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. So the gap for a given m is the set of n from the first n0 (where n0 is the smallest n with Z(n0)=m) to the next multiple of 5 (or until the trailing zeros increase). \n\n            # However, the gap is at most 5. Why? Because when you are at a number that is not a multiple of 5, and you keep increasing n, the trailing zeros stay the same until you hit the next multiple of 5. But wait, what if the next multiple of 5 is a multiple of 25? Then the trailing zeros might jump by more than 1.\n\n            # Actually, the gap is the difference between the two consecutive n where the trailing zeros change. But note: the trailing zeros change only when n is a multiple of 5. So the numbers with the same trailing zeros are consecutive and the next change happens at the next multiple of 5.\n\n            # However, the gap length is 5? Not necessarily. Consider:\n\n            #   At n=24: Z(24)=4 (because 24//5=4, 24//25=0)\n            #   At n=25: Z(25)=6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> 5+1=6)\n\n            #   So from 20 to 24: Z(n)=4 for n=20,21,22,23,24 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   Then from 25 to 29: Z(n)=6 for n=25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   Then 30: Z(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7? Wait: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, so 7.\n\n            #   Then 31:7, 32:7, 33:7, 34:7, 35:8 (because 35//5=7, 35//25=1 -> 8)\n\n            #   So the gap is always 5? \n\n            #   Actually, the trailing zeros function increases only when n is a multiple of 5, and the amount of increase is the exponent of 5 in n. But the gap (the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros) is the distance to the next multiple of 5. Since the next multiple of 5 is 5 away, the gap is 5 numbers (including the starting one and the 4 after until the next multiple of 5 is reached). But wait, the starting n0 might be in the middle of the gap? \n\n            #   Actually, the gap is defined by the next multiple of 5. So the numbers from n0 to n0+4 (if n0 is not a multiple of 5) will have the same trailing zeros until the next multiple of 5. But if n0 is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple of 5 is n0+5, so the gap is from n0 to n0+4 (so 5 numbers). \n\n            #   However, note: if n0 is a multiple of 5, then the trailing zeros at n0 is Z(n0). Then at n0+1, n0+2, n0+3, n0+4, the trailing zeros are still Z(n0) because no new factor of 5 is added. Then at n0+5, we add one more factor (unless n0 was a multiple of 25, then we add two, but wait: the trailing zeros are calculated by the entire product. \n\n            #   Actually, the trailing zeros function is computed by the entire product. The function Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5. The value of Z(n) for n in [a, a+4] is constant? Not exactly: consider n0=25, then Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7. So yes, the gap is 5.\n\n            #   But wait: what about n0=0? We start from positive integers.\n\n            #   Therefore, the gap is always 5 numbers? \n\n            #   However, the above example for m=5: no solution. Why? Because the trailing zeros jump from 4 (at n=24) to 6 (at n=25). So m=5 is skipped.\n\n            #   So the gap is 5, but sometimes we skip a value of m.\n\n            #   Therefore, the set of n for a given m (if exists) is a contiguous block of 5 numbers? Or is it?\n\n            #   Actually, the gap is 5 numbers. But note: the starting n0 might be a multiple of 5, then the set is from n0 to n0+4. But if the starting n0 is not a multiple of 5, then the set is from the first n (which is not a multiple of 5) to n0+4 (which is the next multiple of 5 minus 1). \n\n            #   How do we know the length? It's always 5? \n\n            #   Let me check with m=6:\n\n            #   n_low: smallest n such that Z(n)>=6: \n            #       Z(25)=6, so n_low=25.\n            #       Then n_high: smallest n such that Z(n)>=7: \n            #           Z(30)=7, so n_high=30.\n            #       Then the numbers are from 25 to 29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   m=7: n_low=30, n_high=35 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   m=8: n_low=35, n_high=40 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   m=9: n_low=40, n_high=45 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   m=10: n_low=45, n_high=50 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   m=11: n_low=50, n_high=55 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            #   But wait, what about m=0? (not required) and m=5 is skipped.\n\n            #   So the pattern is: for every m that is not skipped, we have 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            #   But wait, what if m is 0? Then n_low=0, but then we don't consider n=0 (positive integers). Also, the problem states m>=1.\n\n            #   However, the problem says: m from 1 to 100000.\n\n            #   Therefore, the set of n for a given m (if exists) is always a block of 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n            #   But wait: consider m=12. \n            #       Z(50)= floor(50/5)+floor(50/25)+floor(50/125)=10+2+0=12.\n            #       Then the next jump: \n            #           Z(51)=12, Z(52)=12, Z(53)=12, Z(54)=12, Z(55)=13 (because 55//5=11, 55//25=2, 55//125=0 -> 13).\n            #       So again 5 numbers.\n\n            #   But why is m=5 skipped?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This is calculated as \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). This is done using binary search, leveraging the fact that \\( Z(n) \\) is a non-decreasing function. Once we find this \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\)), we check if \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) = m \\). If not, there are no solutions for \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Finding Valid Range**: If \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) = m \\), we then find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (denoted as \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\)). The valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) to \\( n_{\\text{high}} - 1 \\). The count of these values is \\( n_{\\text{high}} - n_{\\text{low}} \\).\n\n4. **Output the Result**: The solution outputs the count of valid \\( n \\) values followed by the list of these values in increasing order. If no such \\( n \\) exists, it simply outputs 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    n_low = find_lower_bound(m)\n    zeros_low = trailing_zeros(n_low)\n    \n    if zeros_low != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\), which is a safe upper bound given the properties of \\( Z(n) \\).\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) and checks if \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) = m \\). If true, it computes \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\) (the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\)) and outputs the count of valid \\( n \\) values along with the list if any exist. If no solution exists, it outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid range of \\( n \\) values using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
