The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that we process the tasks in order.\n\n The challenge: Since the ring is circular, moving from a higher number to a lower one might sometimes be faster to go the other way? But note: the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we can only move clockwise.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is one-way clockwise. This means that from house x, the next house is x+1 (unless x is n, then next is 1). \n\n Therefore, the movement is fixed: only clockwise. So if we are at house x and need to go to house y, we can compute:\n\n If y >= x, then we can go directly: (y - x) steps.\n But if y < x, then we must go from x to n, then wrap to 1 and then to y: which is (n - x + y) steps.\n\n Alternatively, we can note: \n   distance(x, y) = (y - x) % n, but if negative then adjust.\n\n Actually, since we are only allowed to move clockwise, we can define:\n   If y >= x: steps = y - x\n   Else: steps = n - x + y\n\n But note: we start at house 1, and we have to do the tasks in order.\n\n However, note: after completing a task, Xenia is at house a_i. Then the next task requires her to be at a_{i+1}. But she can't jump, she moves step by step.\n\n So we need to compute the total time as the sum of the distances from the current house to the next task's house.\n\n Steps:\n  Let current = 1 (start)\n  total_time = 0\n  For each task location a in the list of m integers:\n      if a >= current:\n          steps = a - current\n      else:\n          steps = n - current + a\n      total_time += steps\n      current = a   (because after completing the task she is at a)\n\n However, let's test with the example: \n      Input: n=4, m=3, tasks = [3,2,3]\n\n      Start at 1.\n      First task: 3 -> steps = 3-1 = 2, total_time=2, now at 3.\n      Second task: 2 -> since 2 < 3, steps = 4-3+2 = 3, total_time=5, now at 2.\n      Third task: 3 -> steps = 3-2 = 1, total_time=6.\n\n      Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: n=4, m=3, tasks = [2,3,3]\n\n      Start at 1.\n      First task: 2 -> steps = 2-1=1, total_time=1, at 2.\n      Second task: 3 -> steps=3-2=1, total_time=2, at 3.\n      Third task: 3 -> steps=0, total_time=2.\n\n      Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n But wait, the second example input provided was: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n However, the example input provided in the problem was:\n        ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n And outputs: ['6', '2']\n\n So the code above seems to work for the examples.\n\n But note: the problem constraints: n, m up to 10^5. The above algorithm is O(m), so it should be efficient.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\n The above simulation does exactly that.\n\n But wait: what if there are duplicate consecutive tasks? For example, [3,3] would do:\n   Start at 1: first task 3 -> 2 steps, then second task 3 -> 0 steps. Total 2.\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the tasks are distinct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Read the first line: n, m\n Read the next line: list of m integers\n\n Then simulate.\n\n But note: the problem says that the ringroad is one-way clockwise. Our calculation for the distance from current to next is correct because we can only move clockwise.\n\n However, an alternative way to calculate the distance is to use modulo arithmetic. But the above if-else is clear.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says to use 64-bit integers? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem.\n\n Code:\n\n Example: \n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            steps = a - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + a\n        total_time += steps\n        current = a\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n However, wait: what if the ringroad is numbered 1 to n, and the movement is clockwise. The above formula for the else part is correct.\n\n But consider: from house 4 (n=4) to house 1: \n        a=1, current=4 -> steps = 4-4+1 = 1? Actually, from 4 we can only move to 1 (since it's a ring). But wait: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so from 4 we go to 1. So the distance from 4 to 1 should be 1 (one step). Correct.\n\n But what about from 4 to 2?\n        a=2, current=4 -> steps = 4-4+2 = 2. \n        Alternatively, we can think: from 4, move to 1 (1 step), then 1 to 2 (another step) -> total 2. Correct.\n\n So the formula holds.\n\n Let's run the example: [3,2,3] again with n=4.\n\n   current=1, a=3 -> steps=2, total=2, current=3.\n   current=3, a=2 -> steps=4-3+2=3, total=5, current=2.\n   current=2, a=3 -> steps=1, total=6.\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait, the example output for the first test case is 6.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as string: '4 3\\n3 2 3'\n\n So the code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n   for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            steps = a - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + a\n        total_time += steps\n        current = a\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n But wait: what if the tasks are not starting from 1? They can start from any house. The above handles that.\n\n However, note: the problem says initially she is at house 1.\n\n One more edge: n=1? But n>=2, so no.\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 6\n Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 2\n\n But wait, the example input provided was two examples in one? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   Input:\n        ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n   Output:\n        ['6', '2']\n\n But our code will read from stdin. The problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n and m ...\".\n\n So we assume one test case per run? Or multiple? Actually, the problem statement is for one test case.\n\n However, the example input is given as two separate strings. But the problem doesn't say there are multiple test cases.\n\n Clarification: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input format.\n\n The typical input format for competitive programming problems is one test case unless specified otherwise.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as two separate examples. In competitive programming, we usually read until EOF or a specific number of test cases.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n and m\". So we read one test case.\n\n But note: the example input is shown as two separate lines of input? Actually, the example input is:\n\n     4 3\n     3 2 3\n\n and \n\n     4 3\n     2 3 3\n\n These are two separate inputs. But the problem says \"Input\" and then shows both. So when we run the program, we should read one test case.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we'll assume one.\n\n However, the problem constraints say that n and m can be up to 10^5, and the input has two lines.\n\n So we write the code for one test case.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as two examples. How did they get two outputs? They probably ran the program twice.\n\n So the code we write is for one test case.\n\n Let me run the provided examples in the code.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n        Output: 6\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        Output: 2\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n However, I notice that the problem says: \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\"\n\n But our calculation for the first example was 2 (from 1->3) then 3 (from 3->2) then 1 (from 2->3). That totals 6.\n\n Why the example sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3? \n\n Actually, note: the sequence of moves is the entire journey. The journey is:\n     Start at 1, then to 2 (for the first step of the move from 1 to 3), then to 3 (that's the first task).\n     Then from 3 to 2: we must go 3->4->1->2, which is three steps (so we traverse 3,4,1,2 -> that's 3 steps).\n     Then from 2 to 3: one step.\n\n So the entire path: 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait, is there a possibility to optimize the computation? We are doing a simple loop, which is O(m). Since m can be up to 10^5, this is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the problem says to use 64-bit integers? In C++ they mention, but in Python we don't have to worry. But the total_time might be large (up to 10^5 * n, and n up to 10^5, so maximum total_time could be 10^10, which is within the range of Python integers).\n\n So we are safe.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\" — but we are writing in Python, so no issue.\n\n Final code:\n\n   Read n and m\n   Read the list of m integers\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   for each task in the list:\n        if task >= current:\n            steps = task - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + task\n        total_time += steps\n        current = task\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n However, we can also write the else part without branching by using modulo arithmetic, but it's not necessary.\n\n But note: the modulo arithmetic approach for circular distance in a clockwise-only ring? Actually, we can compute:\n\n        steps = (task - current) % n   # but wait, if task>=current, then (task-current) % n is task-current, but if task<current, then (task-current) is negative, and modulo n would give a positive? \n\n        Actually, (task - current) % n would give the same as our else part? \n\n        Let d = (task - current) % n\n        But note: if task>=current, then (task-current) % n is task-current (if task-current < n, which it is because task and current are between 1 and n, and task>=current, so the difference is at most n-1, so modulo n doesn't change it).\n\n        However, if task < current, then (task - current) % n = (task - current + n) % n, but note that (task - current + n) is positive and less than n (since task - current is negative and adding n makes it positive, and the absolute value is less than n because the maximum gap in the other direction is n-1). \n\n        But wait, is that the same as our else part?\n\n        Our else part: n - current + task.\n\n        And modulo: (task - current) % n = (task - current + n) % n, but note that (task - current + n) is positive and less than n? Actually, no: if task=1 and current=4, then (1-4+n) = 1-4+4=1, and modulo 4 is 1. But our else part: n - current + task = 4-4+1=1. So same.\n\n        However, wait: the modulo operation for negative in Python: \n            (a - b) % n = (a - b + n) % n if a-b is negative, but actually the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers returns a result in the range [0, n-1]. \n\n        But note: our else part: n - current + task, which is the same as (task - current + n) but without taking modulo? \n\n        Actually, we are not taking modulo, but the value we want is the same as (task - current) mod n, but in the context of a ring of n houses, the minimal clockwise steps from current to task is (task - current) mod n, but wait: in a ring, the clockwise distance from current to task is defined as the smallest nonnegative number of steps to reach task by going only clockwise.\n\n        However, note: the ring has n houses, so the clockwise distance from current to task is:\n\n            if task >= current: task - current\n            else: n - current + task\n\n        And that is exactly (task - current) % n if we define the modulus operation to return a nonnegative remainder. But wait, in modular arithmetic, the standard modulus for negative numbers is defined such that:\n\n            (a - b) % n = (a - b + k*n) % n, where k is chosen so that the result is in [0, n-1].\n\n        But in our case, the distance we want is not the modulus, but the actual steps we take. And since we are only allowed to move clockwise, the steps are:\n\n            steps = (task - current) % n   if we were to consider the modulus gives the minimal steps? \n\n        However, wait: if we are at 4 and want to go to 1, then (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1 (in Python). But we want 1 step. Similarly, from 3 to 2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, which is the same as our else part: 4-3+2 = 3.\n\n        So we can also write:\n\n            steps = (task - current) % n\n            But wait: what if the modulus gives a negative? In Python, the modulus is always nonnegative.\n\n        However, let's check:\n\n            (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 (since -1 + 4 = 3, and 3 % 4 = 3)\n\n            (3-1) % 4 = 2 % 4 = 2.\n\n        So the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers does exactly what we need: it computes the positive equivalent in the range [0, n-1] that is congruent to (task - current) mod n.\n\n        But wait: is the clockwise distance from current to task always (task - current) % n? \n\n        Consider: from current=1 to task=3: (3-1)%4=2 -> correct.\n        from current=3 to task=2: (2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python returns the remainder in the range [0, n-1]. But the clockwise steps from current to task should be the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) % n == task % n, but note: we are not wrapping around arbitrarily. The houses are labeled 1 to n. \n\n        But wait, our houses are labeled from 1 to n. The modulus operation in the above works because:\n\n            We are effectively treating the houses as numbers from 1 to n, but the modulus operation is defined on integers. However, note that:\n\n                (current + d) % n = task % n   is not the same as (current + d) = task (mod n) because the labels are from 1 to n, and the modulus operation in modular arithmetic is defined for residues.\n\n            But we can map the houses to 0-indexed? \n\n        Alternatively, we can map the houses to 0-indexed:\n\n            Let current0 = current - 1, task0 = task - 1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from current0 to task0 in a circle of n nodes (0-indexed) is:\n\n                if task0 >= current0: task0 - current0\n                else: n - current0 + task0\n\n            Then total_steps = (task0 - current0) % n, but wait: in 0-indexed, the modulus doesn't work the same because the modulus base is n, and the numbers are from 0 to n-1.\n\n            Actually, the distance in 0-indexed:\n\n                steps = (task0 - current0) % n   -> but wait, if task0 < current0, then (task0 - current0) is negative, and (task0 - current0) % n = task0 - current0 + n, which is the same as n - (current0 - task0). \n\n            But note: current0 - task0 is positive and equals (current0 - task0). Then n - (current0 - task0) = n - current0 + task0.\n\n            However, we are mapping current to current0 and task to task0, so:\n\n                steps = (task0 - current0) % n   if we do modulus, but wait: the modulus operation in 0-indexed for the circle of n nodes is the same as the clockwise steps.\n\n            Actually, the clockwise steps from current0 to task0 in a circle of n nodes is:\n\n                steps = (task0 - current0) % n   if we consider that the modulus operation gives the shortest nonnegative solution? \n\n            But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers gives the positive equivalent, so:\n\n                steps = (task0 - current0) % n   is the same as:\n\n                    if task0 >= current0: (task0 - current0) % n = task0 - current0 (if task0 - current0 < n, which it is because the maximum difference is n-1) \n                    else: (task0 - current0 + n) % n = (n + task0 - current0) % n, but since n + task0 - current0 is less than n (because task0 - current0 is negative and adding n makes it positive and less than n) then the modulus doesn't change it.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus operation in Python for (x % n) returns a value in [0, n-1]. But the clockwise steps we calculated are:\n\n                if task0 >= current0: task0 - current0 (which is between 0 and n-1)\n                else: n - current0 + task0 (which is also between 1 and n-1) [because current0>task0, so n - current0 + task0 is positive and less than n]\n\n            Now, (task0 - current0) % n = (task0 - current0 + n) % n, but since task0 - current0 is negative, we add n until positive. And the result is the same as n - current0 + task0, which is the else part.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                steps = (task - 1 - (current - 1)) % n   ??? \n\n            But wait, we are mapping the houses to 0-indexed, and then the modulus gives the same as the clockwise distance? \n\n            Actually, no: because the modulus operation in 0-indexed would be:\n\n                steps = (task0 - current0) % n   [if negative, we add n until positive]\n\n            But note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python is defined as:\n\n                a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            Example: (-1) % 4 = -1 - 4 * floor(-1/4) = -1 - 4*(-1) = -1 +4 = 3.\n\n            So yes, the modulus operation gives the same as our else part.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                steps = (task - current) % n   ?\n\n            But wait: in 1-indexed, the modulus operation is not the same as in 0-indexed. Let me test:\n\n                current=3, task=2, n=4.\n\n                (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 -> correct.\n\n                current=1, task=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2 -> correct.\n\n            However, wait: what if the distance is more than n? \n\n            But note: the maximum distance in a circle of n nodes is n-1. So (task - current) is in the range [-n+1, n-1]. When we take modulus, we get a number in [0, n-1]. But note: the modulus operation does not reduce the distance beyond n. However, the maximum distance we need is n-1, so modulus gives the same.\n\n            But wait: what if we are at 1 and want to go to 1? (1-1)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps in the ring? Yes, because the ring has n nodes, and the clockwise movement from a node to itself is 0.\n\n            But wait, is that always the case? In a ring of n nodes, the clockwise distance from a node to itself is 0, and the modulus operation gives 0.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                steps = (task - current) % n\n\n            But wait: what if (task - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n\n            Example: n=4, current=1, task=5. But task is at most n, so task<=n. Similarly, current>=1 and <=n.\n\n            So the maximum positive difference is (n-1) (if current=1, task=n) and the minimum negative difference is -(n-1) (if current=n, task=1). \n\n            Then (task - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. The modulus operation will give:\n\n                For positive: (task - current) % n = (task - current) if task>=current and (task-current) < n, which it is.\n\n                For negative: (task - current) % n = (task - current + n) % n, but note: since task - current is negative, we add n until positive. But note that task - current is at least -(n-1), so we add once: task - current + n, which is in [1, n-1] (because task - current is at least 1-n, so adding n gives at least 1, and at most n-1). \n\n            Therefore, the modulus method works.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus method gives the same as our if-else, but we must be cautious: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers does exactly what we need.\n\n            But note: the modulus operation in Python for (a % n) is defined for any integer a, and returns a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n            However, the problem: we are only allowed to move clockwise, so the distance from current to task is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) % n == task % n? \n\n            But note: the houses are labeled 1 to n, and the modulus operation in the ringroad doesn't use the modulus of the house labels? \n\n            Actually, the ringroad is labeled 1 to n. The movement is: from x, next is x+1 (if x<n) or 1 (if x==n). \n\n            The position after d steps from current is:\n\n                p = current + d (if current+d <= n) OR if current+d > n, then we wrap: (current+d) % n, but note: if (current+d) % n == 0 then it's n? \n\n            Wait, let me map to 0-indexed:\n\n                Let house i corresponds to index i-1.\n\n                Then the next house from index i is (i+1) % n, but wait: if we are at index n-1 (house n) then (n-1+1) % n = n % n = 0, which is house 1.\n\n            So the movement in 0-indexed: from index i, next index is (i+1) % n.\n\n            Then the distance from current index i to target index j is:\n\n                d = (j - i) % n   [but wait, the modulus for negative?] \n\n            Actually, the distance in 0-indexed is:\n\n                d = (j - i + n) % n   if we want the minimal positive steps? \n\n            But note: the minimal positive steps in a circle to go from i to j (clockwise) is:\n\n                if j >= i: j-i\n                else: j-i+n\n\n            Which is the same as (j - i + n) % n, but wait: (j-i+n) is positive and then we take modulus n? \n\n            Actually, (j-i+n) might be >=n, so we can do:\n\n                d = (j - i) % n   [in 0-indexed, the modulus operation returns the minimal nonnegative steps?] \n\n            But wait: in 0-indexed, the modulus operation returns (j-i) mod n, which is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that j-i ≡ d (mod n). But in the ring, the clockwise steps from i to j is the smallest d such that (i+d) % n = j.\n\n            However, note: the equation (i+d) % n = j has a solution d in [0, n-1]. The solution is d = (j - i) % n, but wait: if j < i, then (j-i) is negative, and (j-i) % n is j-i+n, which is the same as the else part.\n\n            But wait: in 0-indexed, we have:\n\n                current0 = current-1, task0 = task-1.\n\n                Then steps = (task0 - current0) % n   [this gives the minimal steps in the 0-indexed circle]?\n\n            However, we must ensure that the modulus operation gives the same as the clockwise steps. \n\n            Example: current=3, task=2, n=4 -> current0=2, task0=1.\n\n                (1-2) % 4 = (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=1, task=3, n=4 -> current0=0, task0=2.\n\n                (2-0)%4=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=4, task=1, n=4 -> current0=3, task0=0.\n\n                (0-3)%4 = (-3)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=2, task=3, n=4 -> current0=1, task0=2.\n\n                (2-1)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            So we can use:\n\n                steps = (task - 1 - (current - 1)) % n\n\n            But wait: that is (task - current) % n, same as above.\n\n            Actually, (task - current) % n is the same as (task0 - current0) % n? \n\n            Because: (task - current) = (task0+1) - (current0+1) = task0 - current0.\n\n            So yes, (task - current) % n is the same as (task0 - current0) % n.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                steps = (task - current) % n\n\n            But wait: is that always the case? \n\n            Example: current=5, task=3, n=10 -> but wait, n=10, then (3-5)%10 = (-2)%10=8, and the clockwise steps from 5 to 3 in a ring of 10: \n                5->6->7->8->9->10->1->2->3: that's 8 steps. Correct.\n\n            However, note: our original if-else condition is based on the 1-indexed system. But the modulus operation works the same.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation in Python for (a % n) is defined for any integer a, and returns the remainder in [0, n-1]. And the clockwise steps from current to task is exactly (task - current) % n, because:\n\n                We are effectively computing the smallest nonnegative d such that (current + d) ≡ task (mod n) in the additive group modulo n, but note: the ringroad labels are 1 to n, and the modulus operation is defined for integers. \n\n            However, there's a catch: the modulus operation does not distinguish between different representations. But the ringroad is cyclic and the labeling is consecutive, so the modulus operation works.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation does not consider the labels as modulo n, because the labels are 1 to n. However, note that:\n\n                We can map the labels to 0-indexed: subtract 1, then the modulus operation is the same.\n\n            Actually, the modulus operation in the ringroad is independent of the labeling. The distance from current to task is the smallest d such that:\n\n                (current + d) % n == task % n   [if we map to 0-indexed, then (current0 + d) % n = task0]\n\n            But wait, if we map to 0-indexed:\n\n                current0 = (current-1) % n   [but current is already in [1, n], so current0 in [0, n-1]]\n                task0 = (task-1) % n\n\n            Then the equation becomes:\n\n                (current0 + d) % n = task0   => d = (task0 - current0) % n   (with the modulus operation handling negative)\n\n            And since (task0 - current0) = (task-1) - (current-1) = task - current, we have:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n\n            Therefore, the two methods are equivalent.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                steps = (task - current) % n\n\n            But wait: what if (task - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n\n            Example: n=4, current=1, task=5 -> but task cannot be 5 because task is between 1 and n. So no.\n\n            Similarly, the input ensures 1<=ai<=n.\n\n            Therefore, the modulus method is valid and simpler.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation might be slightly faster, but the if-else is clear and also O(1) per task.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation for integers in Python is efficient, and for 10^5 iterations, it's acceptable.\n\n            Let me test with the example [3,2,3] with modulus:\n\n                current=1, task=3: (3-1)%4=2 -> correct.\n                current=3, task=2: (2-3)%4= -1%4=3 -> correct.\n                current=2, task=3: (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            And [2,3,3]:\n\n                current=1, task=2: (2-1)%4=1 -> correct.\n                current=2, task=3: (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n                current=3, task=3: (3-3)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n            So the modulus method works.\n\n            However, wait: what if the modulus result is 0? Then the steps are 0, which is correct.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation for 0 is 0.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                steps = (task - current) % n\n\n            But note: the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers less than n returns the number itself, and for negative numbers it returns the positive equivalent.\n\n            Therefore, we can simplify the code to:\n\n                n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                current = 1\n                total_time = 0\n                for a in tasks:\n                    # Compute the clockwise steps from current to a\n                    steps = (a - current) % n\n                    # But wait: if (a - current) is positive, then (a-current)%n is the same as a-current, but if negative, then it's the adjusted value.\n                    total_time += steps\n                    current = a\n\n            However, wait: is that correct? \n\n            Let me test with the example: n=4, current=3, a=2: (2-3)%4 = -1%4=3 -> correct.\n\n            But wait: what if (a - current) is negative and we get a positive modulus, but the actual steps should be the modulus value? \n\n            Yes, because the modulus value is the number of steps.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation gives the minimal positive steps in the circle, which is exactly the clockwise steps.\n\n            But wait: what if the modulus operation gives a value that is not the minimal steps? \n\n            Actually, in a circle of n nodes, the clockwise steps from current to task is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) % n == task (if we use 1-indexed, we have to be careful). \n\n            However, we mapped the subtraction to the modulus and it worked for the examples.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation in the ring of n nodes for positions 1..n is not the same as the modulus operation for the additive group? \n\n            Let me clarify:\n\n                In the additive group modulo n, the element current is represented by an integer in [1, n]. We can map it to [0, n-1] by subtracting 1.\n\n                Then the equation (current + d) % n = task (in the additive group) is not the same as the ringroad movement if we don't map the labels.\n\n            However, note: the ringroad movement is defined on the labels 1 to n. The movement is:\n\n                From x, next is x+1 (if x<n) or 1 (if x==n).\n\n            This is equivalent to:\n\n                The next house is ((x-1)+1) % n + 1.\n\n            So the position after d steps from current is:\n\n                pos = (current - 1 + d) % n + 1\n\n            We require pos = task.\n\n            Therefore:\n\n                (current - 1 + d) % n + 1 = task\n\n            => (current - 1 + d) % n = task - 1\n\n            => d = (task - 1 - (current - 1)) % n   [again, the modulus operation for the additive group]\n\n            => d = (task - current) % n   [same as above]\n\n            So the modulus operation is justified.\n\n            Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation might be considered overkill, but it's concise.\n\n            But wait: what if the modulus operation gives 0? Then d=0, meaning we don't move. Correct.\n\n            What if the modulus operation gives",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad with houses numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. For each task, she needs to be at the specified house, having completed all previous tasks. The challenge is to compute the minimal time required by summing the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Key Insight**: The distance between two houses on a circular ringroad can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. If the target house is ahead of the current house, the distance is simply the difference. If the target house is behind, the distance is computed by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad and then to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the steps needed to move from the current house to the task's house using modulo operation. This avoids conditional checks and simplifies the calculation. The total time is the sum of these steps for all tasks.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        steps = (a - current) % n\n        if steps < 0:\n            steps += n\n        total_time += steps\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of houses (n) and tasks (m), followed by the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (current position) with total time initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - **Steps Calculation**: The steps to reach the task from the current position is computed using modulo arithmetic. If the result is negative, it is adjusted by adding n to ensure it represents the correct clockwise distance.\n   - **Update Total Time**: The computed steps are added to the total time.\n   - **Update Current Position**: After completing a task, the current position is updated to the task's house.\n4. **Output**: The total accumulated time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement and ensures minimal time calculation by leveraging modulo arithmetic to simplify distance computation.",
