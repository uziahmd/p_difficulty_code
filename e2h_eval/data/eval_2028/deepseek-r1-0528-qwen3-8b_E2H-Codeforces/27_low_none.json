On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. We want the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\n Note: The entire sequence only contains 1 and 2. Therefore, a non-decreasing subsequence is simply a contiguous block of 1's or a contiguous block of 2's? Actually, no: because the subsequence does not have to be contiguous, but the values must be non-decreasing. However, since the only numbers are 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we have a block of 1's followed by a block of 2's. But note: we can also have a mix if there are no decreases.\n\n However, note that the problem allows reversing an interval. After reversal, the sequence may have some parts as 1's and some as 2's, but the reversal might change the order.\n\n Observation:\n In the original sequence, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is at least the length of the longest contiguous block of 1's or 2's, but actually we can combine 1's and 2's as long as they are in increasing order. However, because the numbers are only 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we start with 1 and then switch to 2 and then don't have any 1 after 2.\n\n Actually, the entire sequence might be non-decreasing if we arrange all the 1's first and then all the 2's. Then the LNDS would be the entire sequence.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. So we can think:\n\n Without reversal, the best LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., all 1's then 2's). Otherwise, we might break the sequence into two parts: the prefix of 1's and the suffix of 2's.\n\n However, we can reverse one contiguous interval. How does reversal affect the sequence?\n\n Let the original sequence be A. After reversing [l, r], we get:\n   A[0:l-1] + reversed(A[l:r+1]) + A[r+1:]\n\n Since we only have 1 and 2, reversing an interval doesn't change the counts of 1 and 2, but it changes the arrangement.\n\n What is the goal? To maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: In a sequence of 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 comes before a 1). Otherwise, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, so the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be the entire sequence except for some part that breaks the order.\n\n But wait, the problem says that after reversal we can get a sequence that is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1] in the second example. However, in that example the answer is 9. Why 9? Because the entire sequence has 11 elements, but the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9. \n\n How to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a sequence of 1's and 2's? \n We can do dynamic programming, but note: n up to 2000. However, the state space is 2000*2000 which is 4e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be careful. But note: the sequence only has two distinct numbers, so we can use a simpler method.\n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1's and 2's can be computed by:\n   Let dp[i] = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n   Then for each i, we can set dp[i] = 1 + (number of 1's from 0 to i if we are at a 1? Not exactly)\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the entire sequence is broken into segments of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can have:\n\n   Option 1: Use all the 1's and then as many 2's as possible until a 1 appears again? Actually, no: the subsequence does not need to be contiguous.\n\n However, because the sequence is made of only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. If not, then we can remove the decreasing parts. But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval.\n\n Another observation: the entire sequence of 1's and 2's has the property that the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The key observation here is that the optimal solution can be derived by considering the entire sequence and identifying segments where reversing an interval can help in forming a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence can include all 1s followed by all 2s. The challenge is to find the best interval to reverse so that the resulting sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence.\n2. **Insight**: The longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversal will be the entire sequence if it is already non-decreasing. Otherwise, the LNDS will be the entire sequence minus some parts that are not in order. However, reversing a specific interval can help in aligning 1s before 2s more effectively.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence for the original sequence. Then, we consider all possible intervals that could be reversed and compute the potential increase in the LNDS length. The solution involves:\n   - Precomputing the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for the original sequence.\n   - For each possible reversal interval, updating the sequence and recomputing the LIS length efficiently.\n4. **Optimization**: To handle the constraints efficiently (n ≤ 2000), we use a two-pointer technique to manage the segments around the reversed interval and update the LIS length in linear time relative to the segment sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    dp = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n                if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:\n                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1\n                    \n    ans = max(dp) if n > 1 else 1\n    \n    left_arr = [0] * n\n    right_arr = [0] * n\n    \n    left_arr[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1]\n            \n    right_arr[n-1] = 1\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1]\n            \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if ans == n:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    best = ans\n    \n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            ones_in_segment = 0\n            twos_in_segment = 0\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if arr[i] == 1:\n                    ones_in_segment += 1\n                else:\n                    twos_in_segment += 1\n                    \n            ones_before = prefix_ones[l-1] if l-1 >= 0 else 0\n            ones_after = prefix_ones[n] - prefix_ones[r+1] if r+1 <= n else 0\n            \n            twos_before = total_twos - (suffix_twos[l-1] if l-1 >= 0 else 0)\n            twos_after = (suffix_twos[r+1] if r+1 < n else 0)\n            \n            new_ones = ones_before + ones_in_segment + ones_after\n            new_twos = twos_before + twos_in_segment + twos_after\n            \n            candidate = new_ones + new_twos\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` (length of the sequence) and a list `arr` (the sequence itself).\n2. **Dynamic Programming for LIS**: The `dp` array is initialized where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is filled by comparing each element with all previous elements.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays (`left_arr` and `right_arr`) store the count of consecutive 1s and 2s starting from the beginning or end, respectively. `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos` store cumulative counts of 1s and 2s from the start and end.\n4. **Total Counts Calculation**: The total number of 1s and 2s in the sequence is computed using `prefix_ones`.\n5. **Interval Reversal Check**: For each possible interval `[l, r]`, the code checks how reversing this interval affects the sequence's structure. The counts of 1s and 2s before and after the interval are used to determine the potential LNDS length post-reversal.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value between the original LNDS and the best possible LNDS after any reversal is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible reversal intervals and leverages dynamic programming and prefix/suffix sums to optimize the solution within feasible time complexity.",
