Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. So total data is at most 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n\n We are to find all integers p in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying when:\n   (1) The current file's progress is p: floor(100 * x / a_i) = p   for some x from 0 to a_i (but note: we update after each byte, so x is an integer from 0 to a_i)\n   (2) The overall progress is p: floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_bytes) = p\n\n However, note that the overall progress uses the sum of bytes from all files so far (including the current file partially) and the total of all files.\n\n But note: the overall progress uses the entire set of files (all n). Let S = a1 + a2 + ... + an.\n\n Conditions for a given p and a moment (during file i, having copied x bytes in file i) are:\n\n   Condition 1: There exists an integer x (0 <= x <= a_i) such that:\n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1   =>   ceil((p * a_i)/100) <= x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)   [But note: floor division and rounding down]\n\n   Actually, the condition is: floor(100*x/a_i) = p  <=> \n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        => (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n   Since x must be an integer, then x must be in [ceil((p * a_i)/100), floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]? \n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n        x_min1 = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   but note: if (p * a_i) is divisible by 100, then x_min1 = (p * a_i)//100, but also note that if (p * a_i) is not divisible, then ceil((p*a_i)/100) is the smallest integer >= (p*a_i)/100.\n\n   However, note the condition: floor(100*x/a_i) = p means:\n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        => x >= (p * a_i + 99) // 100? Actually, let's do it properly:\n\n        x must satisfy: \n            x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100)   [if we consider real numbers, then the smallest integer x such that 100*x/a_i >= p is x0 = ceil(p * a_i / 100)]\n        but wait: actually, the condition is 100*x/a_i >= p and 100*x/a_i < p+1.\n\n        So the minimal x is ceil(p * a_i / 100) and the maximal x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) [to avoid floating point?] or more precisely, the largest integer x such that x < (p+1)*a_i/100 is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) which is equivalent to floor((p+1)*a_i/100) - 1 if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100? Actually, no: we want the strict inequality.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because ceil(a) = (a + 99) // 100 for positive a? Not exactly, but we can use:]\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n            x_min = (p * a_i) // 100 + (1 if (p * a_i) % 100 != 0 else 0)   # This is ceil for nonnegative numbers?\n        But note: if (p * a_i) is divisible by 100, then (p * a_i) // 100 is an integer and we need x_min = (p * a_i) // 100, because then 100*x_min/a_i = p, so floor is p. But if not, then we need the next integer.\n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   # This is a common trick for ceiling division: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b, but here we are dividing by 100.\n\n        Similarly, the maximum x is the maximum integer strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100. That is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) but we can use:\n            x_max = min(a_i, ((p+1) * a_i) // 100)   ? But wait: condition is x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) = floor((p+1)*a_i/100) - 1 if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100? Actually, no: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then the condition is x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so x_max = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1. But if not, then x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i/100).\n\n        Alternatively, we can say: the condition for the current file is that x must be in the interval [x_min, x_max] where:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_max = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100)   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0 then (p+1)*a_i//100 is the floor, and that is the maximum? Actually, no: because if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is not an integer, and the condition x < (p+1)*a_i/100 is satisfied by x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i/100). But if divisible, then x_max = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        However, note that the condition for the current file is that the current progress is p. And the overall progress must be p at the same time.\n\n        Condition 2: The overall progress is p: \n            Let T = total_bytes (the sum of all a_i)\n            Let Y = (sum of bytes copied so far) = (sum of bytes from previous files) + x (from current file)\n\n            Condition: p <= 100*Y / T < p+1\n            => Y must be in [ceil(p * T / 100), floor((p+1)*T/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n        But note: the overall progress condition must hold at the same moment. \n\n        However, the problem: we have to check for every file i and every x in [0, a_i] (but we are iterating over files and then x from 0 to a_i) but note: n<=100, a_i<=1000, so total operations would be about 100*1000=100000, and then for each x we check the overall progress. Then we have to record which p values occur.\n\n        But note: we are asked for all p from 0 to 100 that occur at least once.\n\n        However, we can simulate the entire process? The total number of bytes is at most 100000, so we cannot iterate over every single byte (because 100000 bytes is acceptable for n<=100, but worst-case 100000*100 = 10 million, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we can think of a smarter way.)\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We know that the overall progress is determined by the cumulative sum. Let prefix[i] = a1 + a2 + ... + a_i.\n\n        Then, for the moment when we are copying the i-th file and have copied x bytes, the total bytes copied is prefix[i-1] + x.\n\n        Conditions:\n          1. p <= (100 * x) / a_i < p+1   -> x must be in [x_low, x_high] for file i and p.\n          2. p <= (100 * (prefix[i-1] + x)) / T < p+1   -> (prefix[i-1]+x) must be in [y_low, y_high] for the overall p, where T = prefix[n-1] (total).\n\n        So for fixed p and file i, we can compute:\n          x_low1 = ceil( (p * a_i) / 100 )   [which is (p*a_i + 99)//100]\n          x_high1 = floor( (p+1)*a_i / 100 - 1e-9 )   but note: we can use: x_high1 = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100) if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0? Actually, we can use:\n          Actually, the condition for x is: 100*x >= p * a_i and 100*x < (p+1)*a_i.\n\n          So x_low1 = ceil(p * a_i / 100) = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n          x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [because 100*x < (p+1)*a_i  => x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, but wait: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is an integer and the condition requires x < that integer, so x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1. Otherwise, x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i//100.\n\n          However, note: in integer arithmetic, we can write:\n            x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # but then if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, then we must subtract one? Actually, no: because the condition is strict. We can do:\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n            x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - (1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else 0)   but wait, that doesn't work because if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then we require x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so x_max = (p+1)*a_i/100 - 1. But (p+1)*a_i//100 is the integer value, so we subtract one.\n\n          However, note: in integer arithmetic, (p+1)*a_i might not be divisible by 100. We can also use:\n\n          Condition for x: x must be in [x_low1, x_high1] where:\n            x_low1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0 then this is the floor, but if divisible, then we have to use (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n          Actually, the condition for the current file is: \n            x must be the smallest integer >= (p * a_i)/100 and strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n          So we can set:\n            x_low1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   # This gives the ceiling of (p*a_i)/100 without floating point.\n            x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # This gives the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100, but note: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then the condition requires x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so we must have x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n            x_high1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100\n            if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0:\n                x_high1 -= 1\n\n          But note: what if (p+1)*a_i//100 is 0? Then subtracting one might become negative. But then the interval [x_low1, x_high1] would be empty. So that's okay.\n\n        Now, for the overall condition, we require that the cumulative bytes (prefix[i-1] + x) falls in [y_low, y_high] for the overall progress p, where:\n            y_low = ceil(p * T / 100) = (p * T + 99) // 100\n            y_high = floor((p+1)*T/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*T // 100   if (p+1)*T % 100 != 0, but if divisible, then (p+1)*T//100 - 1.\n\n        Actually, same as above.\n\n        However, note: the overall condition must hold for the same x. So for a fixed file i and p, we require that there exists an integer x such that:\n          x in [x_low1, x_high1] (for the current file) and \n          (prefix[i-1] + x) in [y_low, y_high] (for the overall progress)\n\n        How to check for a fixed i and p?\n\n        Steps:\n          For each p in [0,100]:\n            For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n              Compute x_low1 and x_high1 (the valid x range for the current file i to have current progress p)\n              If the interval [x_low1, x_high1] is empty, skip this file i for this p.\n\n              Then, we require that there exists an x in [x_low1, x_high1] such that:\n                  y_low <= prefix[i-1] + x <= y_high\n\n              But note: prefix[i-1] is the total bytes from the first i-1 files.\n\n              So, let L = max(x_low1, y_low - prefix[i-1])\n                     R = min(x_high1, y_high - prefix[i-1])\n\n              Then if L <= R and L,R are within [0, a_i] (actually x is from 0 to a_i, but our x_low1 and x_high1 already consider a_i? Actually, no: we computed x_high1 as min(a_i, ...) ? No, we didn't. We must also ensure that x is at most a_i.\n\n              Correction: In the current file, x must be between 0 and a_i. But our x_low1 and x_high1 are computed from the current file's condition. However, note that the condition for the current file already uses a_i, so x_high1 might be greater than a_i? Actually, no: because we defined x_high1 based on the condition 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, and x cannot exceed a_i. But note: if (p+1)*a_i/100 > a_i, then x_high1 would be set to a_i (by the condition that x<=a_i) but wait, we did not cap x_high1 by a_i in the condition above. \n\n          Actually, we must consider that x cannot exceed a_i. So we should set:\n            x_low1 = max(0, (p * a_i + 99) // 100)   [but note: if p=0, then x_low1=0, but if p>0 and (p*a_i+99)//100 is negative? No, since a_i>=1 and p>=0, so nonnegative.]\n\n          And then we set:\n            x_high1 = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100)   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0, but wait: no, because the condition is strict: x < (p+1)*a_i/100. So if (p+1)*a_i/100 is greater than a_i, then the condition is automatically satisfied for any x in [0,a_i]. But note: the condition for the current file progress is only defined for x from 0 to a_i. However, the condition for the current file progress p might not be met for all x in [0,a_i] if (p+1)*a_i/100 < a_i.\n\n          Actually, we must combine the two conditions for the current file: x must be in [0, a_i] and also in [x_low1, x_high1] (with the strict condition). But note: the condition for the current file progress is independent of the overall progress.\n\n          Let me restructure:\n\n          For a fixed file i and p, the current file condition requires:\n            x in [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)] ∩ [0, a_i]\n\n          Similarly, the overall condition requires that the cumulative sum (prefix[i-1]+x) is in [ceil(p*T/100), floor((p+1)*T/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n          Then, we are looking for an x that satisfies both.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating over p from 0 to 100, and for each p and each file i, we can check the intersection of the two intervals.\n\n        Steps for fixed p and file i:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the current file condition interval for x (without considering the overall condition, but with the constraint that x is between 0 and a_i):\n\n            x_low_cur = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_high_cur = (p+1)*a_i // 100\n            if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0:\n                x_high_cur = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1\n\n            Then clamp x_high_cur to a_i: x_high_cur = min(x_high_cur, a_i)\n\n            So the current file condition: x must be in [x_low_cur, x_high_cur] (and note x_low_cur might be negative, so we set x_low_cur = max(0, x_low_cur))\n\n          Step 2: Compute the overall condition interval for the cumulative sum Y = prefix[i-1] + x:\n\n            y_low_over = (p * T + 99) // 100\n            y_high_over = (p+1)*T // 100\n            if (p+1)*T % 100 == 0:\n                y_high_over = (p+1)*T // 100 - 1\n\n            Then, the cumulative sum Y must be in [y_low_over, y_high_over].\n\n            But note: Y = prefix[i-1] + x, so x must be in [y_low_over - prefix[i-1], y_high_over - prefix[i-1]].\n\n          Step 3: The x must be in the intersection of [x_low_cur, x_high_cur] and [y_low_over - prefix[i-1], y_high_over - prefix[i-1]].\n\n          Additionally, note that the cumulative sum condition must be satisfied at the moment, so the cumulative sum must be at least y_low_over and at most y_high_over.\n\n        But note: the cumulative sum condition depends on the entire set of files. However, the cumulative sum at the beginning of file i is prefix[i-1] (if i>=1). For i=0, prefix[-1]=0.\n\n        However, there is an issue: the overall condition must be satisfied at the moment, but note that the overall progress is defined by the entire set of files. Even though we are in the middle of file i, the total T is fixed (the entire array).\n\n        Also note: the overall condition does not depend on the order of files beyond the cumulative sum. But the cumulative sum is the sum of the first i-1 files plus x (from the i-th file). \n\n        Implementation:\n\n          Precompute:\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            T = sum(a)\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          Then, for each p in range(0,101):\n            found = False\n            for i in range(n):   # i from 0 to n-1\n                # Current file is a[i]\n                # Previous files sum: prefix[i]\n\n                # Condition for current file i: \n                #   x must be in [x_low_cur, x_high_cur] (clamped to [0, a[i]])\n                x_low_cur = (p * a[i] + 99) // 100\n                x_high_cur = (p+1) * a[i] // 100\n                if (p+1)*a[i] % 100 == 0:\n                    x_high_cur -= 1\n                x_low_cur = max(0, x_low_cur)\n                x_high_cur = min(x_high_cur, a[i])\n\n                if x_low_cur > x_high_cur:\n                    continue   # no x for this file i and p\n\n                # Condition for overall progress: cumulative sum Y = prefix[i] + x must be in [y_low_over, y_high_over]\n                y_low_over = (p * T + 99) // 100\n                y_high_over = (p+1) * T // 100\n                if (p+1)*T % 100 == 0:\n                    y_high_over -= 1\n\n                # The cumulative sum must be at least y_low_over and at most y_high_over.\n                # But note: the cumulative sum at the moment is prefix[i] + x, so:\n                x_min_for_overall = y_low_over - prefix[i]\n                x_max_for_overall = y_high_over - prefix[i]\n\n                # But note: the cumulative sum condition must hold, and x must be an integer between 0 and a[i] (as above). Also, the cumulative sum must be at least prefix[i] (we haven't started the current file) and at most prefix[i] + a[i] (when we finish the current file).\n\n                # Now, we need to find an x that is in the intersection of [x_low_cur, x_high_cur] and [x_min_for_overall, x_max_for_overall].\n\n                low_bound = max(x_low_cur, x_min_for_overall)\n                high_bound = min(x_high_cur, x_max_for_overall)\n\n                if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                    # Then there exists an x in [low_bound, high_bound] that satisfies both conditions.\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n            if found:\n                # Then p is a candidate\n                add p to the answer set.\n\n        However, note: the overall condition's y_low_over and y_high_over are computed from the entire T. But note: the cumulative sum condition must be satisfied by the entire process (all files). But wait, the overall progress is defined by the entire set of files (all n). However, we are in the middle of file i, so the total is T, but the cumulative sum is prefix[i] + x (which is the sum of the first i files partially). \n\n        But note: the problem says the second progress bar shows: floor(100 * (a1+...+a_{i-1}+x) / (a1+...+a_n)) = floor(100*(prefix[i]+x)/T)\n\n        So the above computation for the overall condition is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the cumulative sum condition requires a value that is not reached until later? Actually, we are checking for the same moment. The moment we are in file i, the cumulative sum is prefix[i-1] + x (if we index from 0, then prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i]). Actually, in our code above, we used prefix[i] for the sum of the first i files. But note: we defined prefix[0]=0, then prefix[1]=a0, prefix[2]=a0+a1, etc.\n\n        In the loop for file i (0-indexed), the previous files sum is prefix[i] (because prefix[i] = a0+...+a_{i-1}). Then we are going to copy x bytes of the i-th file (a[i]), so the cumulative sum becomes prefix[i] + x.\n\n        So the code above uses prefix[i] (the sum of the first i files) and then the current file's partial x.\n\n        But note: the condition for the overall progress uses T (the total) and the cumulative sum (prefix[i] + x). \n\n        However, there is a catch: the overall progress condition is defined by the entire set of files. But note: the cumulative sum at the moment is the sum of the first i files (fully) plus the current file's x. Then the overall progress is (prefix[i] + x) / T * 100, rounded down.\n\n        So the above is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the required cumulative sum (for the overall condition) is less than prefix[i]? Then x_min_for_overall = y_low_over - prefix[i] is negative. Then the intersection [max(x_low_cur, x_min_for_overall), min(x_high_cur, x_max_for_overall)] might be empty even if the overall condition is satisfied by a cumulative sum that is less than prefix[i] (which is impossible). \n\n        However, note: the cumulative sum is at least prefix[i] (since x>=0). So the overall condition requires that the cumulative sum is at least y_low_over, which is ceil(p*T/100). But if y_low_over < prefix[i], then the condition is automatically satisfied by any x (because the cumulative sum is at least prefix[i] >= y_low_over) and then we only need to check the current file condition and the upper bound of the overall condition.\n\n        Actually, the overall condition requires two things: \n            (a) The cumulative sum must be at least y_low_over (ceil(p*T/100))\n            (b) The cumulative sum must be less than y_high_over (floor((p+1)*T/100 - 1e-9)+1?)\n\n        But note: the cumulative sum is prefix[i] + x, and x>=0, so the cumulative sum is at least prefix[i]. Therefore, if y_low_over > prefix[i] + a[i] (the maximum cumulative sum we can have at file i) then the condition (a) cannot be satisfied. Similarly, if y_high_over < prefix[i] (the minimum cumulative sum at the start of file i) then condition (b) fails.\n\n        However, in our computation of x_min_for_overall = y_low_over - prefix[i] and x_max_for_overall = y_high_over - prefix[i], we are allowing negative x_min_for_overall. But then the intersection with [x_low_cur, x_high_cur] (which is [0, a[i]]) will naturally adjust.\n\n        Example: \n          p=0: \n            Condition for current file: x_low_cur = (0*a_i+99)//100 = 0, x_high_cur = (1*a_i)//100, then if a_i%100==0, subtract 1 -> 0. So x must be 0 (if a_i%100==0) or [0, (a_i)//100] (if not divisible).\n            Condition for overall: y_low_over = (0*T+99)//100 = 0, y_high_over = (1*T)//100, then if T%100==0, subtract 1 -> (T//100)-1.\n            Then x_min_for_overall = 0 - prefix[i] = negative, so we take max(0, negative)=0, and x_max_for_overall = (T//100) - 1 - prefix[i] (if T divisible by 100) or (T//100) - prefix[i] (if not). Then the intersection of [0, ...] and [0, ...] is [0, min(x_high_cur, x_max_for_overall)]. \n\n        But note: the overall condition for p=0 requires that the cumulative sum is less than (p+1)*T/100 (which is T/100). So the cumulative sum must be less than T/100, meaning the entire process hasn't finished. \n\n        However, if we are in the last file, then the cumulative sum is at least prefix[i] (which is T - a[i]) and then adding x (from 0 to a[i]). The condition for p=0 overall is that the cumulative sum is less than T/100. But T/100 is the total percentage, so 0 <= cumulative_sum/T < 1. But if T is large, then T/100 is 10 times the total? Wait, no: T is in bytes, and p=0 means floor(100*cumulative_sum/T)=0, so cumulative_sum < T/100.\n\n        Example: if T=1000, then p=0 requires cumulative_sum < 10.\n\n        So if we are at the first file and the first file is 500, then when we copy 9 bytes, the cumulative_sum=9, then the overall progress is floor(100*9/1000)=0. So that's valid.\n\n        However, note: the current file condition for p=0: \n            floor(100*x/500)=0 -> x < 500/100 = 5, so x in [0,4] (if 500%100==0 then x_high_cur=5-1=4, otherwise if 500%100!=0 then x_high_cur=500//100=5, but then subtract 1? Actually, 500//100=5, and 500%100==0, so we subtract 1 -> 4).\n\n        Then the overall condition: cumulative_sum = 0 (from previous) + x (from current) must be < 10, so x<10. But our x is in [0,4] so it's satisfied.\n\n        So the code above should work.\n\n        However, note: the overall condition uses the entire set of files (T) and the cumulative sum (prefix[i]+x). But what if we are in the middle of the process and the cumulative sum is less than T (obviously) but the condition for p=100 requires cumulative_sum >= ceil(100*T/100)=T, so only at the end (when cumulative_sum=T) we have p=100. But note: the condition for p=100 is:\n            floor(100*cumulative_sum/T) = 100 -> cumulative_sum must be >= T and < T+1, but cumulative_sum cannot exceed T. So only when cumulative_sum=T, then floor(100*T/T)=100. \n\n        Therefore, p=100 is achieved only at the very end (after the last byte of the last file). \n\n        Similarly, for p=0, we get it at the beginning and during the process until the cumulative sum reaches T/100.\n\n        But note: the condition for the current file at the end of the process: when we are in the last file, the current file condition for p=100: \n            floor(100*x/a_last) = 100 -> x must be a_last (because 100*x/a_last >= 100 -> x>=a_last, but x<=a_last, so x=a_last) and then the overall condition requires cumulative_sum=T, which is satisfied.\n\n        So the code above must account for the entire process.\n\n        However, note: the above method iterates p from 0 to 100 and for each file i. But note: the same p might be achieved multiple times, but we only need to output distinct p's.\n\n        But wait: there's a catch. The above method does not check the possibility that the same p might appear in different files. But we are just marking p as found if at least one file i and one x satisfies the conditions.\n\n        One more issue: the overall condition uses the entire T (the total of all files). But note: the cumulative sum is the sum of the first i files (prefix[i]) plus x (from the i-th file). However, the overall condition is defined by the entire set of files (all n). This is correct.\n\n        Let's test with the example: ['1\\n6'] -> one file of 6 bytes.\n\n        T = 6.\n\n        For p=0: \n          File0: a0=6.\n          Current condition: x_low_cur = (0*6+99)//100 = 0, x_high_cur = (1*6)//100 = 0 (then 6%100!=0? Actually, 6//100=0, and then we don't subtract one because 6%100!=0? Actually, no: the condition for the current file: floor(100*x/6)=0 -> 100*x/6 < 1 -> x < 0.06, so x=0. Then the overall condition: y_low_over = (0*6+99)//100=0, y_high_over = (1*6)//100=0 (then 6%100!=0 -> no subtraction) -> so cumulative_sum must be in [0,0]. Cumulative_sum = 0 (prefix[0]=0, then x=0) -> 0 is in [0,0]. So p=0 is found.\n\n        For p=16: \n          Current condition for file0: floor(100*x/6)=16 -> 16<=100*x/6<17 -> 16*6<=100*x<17*6 -> 96<=100*x<102 -> x>= ceil(96/100)=ceil(0.96)=1, and x<102/100=1.02 -> x in [1,1] (if 102%100==2, so we don't subtract one). Then x=1.\n\n          Overall condition: cumulative_sum = 0+1 = 1, then floor(100*1/6)=0, so p=0, not 16.\n\n        Wait, what? The overall condition must be 16? But the overall condition is floor(100*1/6)=0, so at x=1 the overall progress is 0, not 16.\n\n        Therefore, p=16 is not achieved at x=1.\n\n        Then why is the example output \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\" for the first example? \n\n        The example input is '1\\n6'. There is only one file. So the two progress bars should show the same value at every moment.\n\n        Therefore, the example output should be all the p that occur during the copying of the 6-byte file.\n\n        The current progress: \n            x=0: 0%\n            x=1: floor(100*1/6)=0%\n            x=2: floor(200/6)=33% -> 33\n            x=3: floor(300/6)=5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that there exists a moment during the copying of files where both the current file's progress and the overall progress bars show the same percentage. The progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, and their values are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the copying process of multiple files and checking at each byte copied whether the current file's progress and the overall progress match any specific percentage (p). The key insight is that for each percentage p, we need to check if there exists a byte count x in the current file such that:\n   - The current file's progress is exactly p: `floor(100 * x / a_i) = p`.\n   - The overall progress is also p: `floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_bytes) = p`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each file and each possible percentage p, we can compute the range of bytes x in the current file that would result in the current file's progress being p. Then, we check if within this range, there exists an x such that the cumulative bytes (sum of previous files' bytes plus x) results in the overall progress also being p.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Precompute the cumulative sum of file sizes up to each file to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied so far.\n   - **Range Calculation**: For each p and each file, compute the valid range of bytes x in the current file that would make the current progress p. Similarly, compute the valid range of cumulative bytes for the overall progress to be p.\n   - **Intersection Check**: For each file and p, check if the intersection of the valid ranges for x (current progress) and the cumulative bytes (overall progress) is non-empty. If it is, then p is a valid percentage.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over each p (101 values) and each file (up to 100 files). For each file and p, it performs constant-time calculations. Thus, the complexity is O(n * 101), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    T = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    results = set()\n    \n    for p in range(0, 101):\n        found = False\n        for i in range(n):\n            file_size = a[i]\n            prev_sum = prefix[i]\n            \n            x_low_cur = (p * file_size + 99) // 100\n            x_high_cur = (p + 1) * file_size // 100\n            if (p + 1) * file_size % 100 == 0:\n                x_high_cur -= 1\n            x_low_cur = max(0, x_low_cur)\n            x_high_cur = min(x_high_cur, file_size)\n            \n            if x_low_cur > x_high_cur:\n                continue\n                \n            y_low_over = (p * T + 99) // 100\n            y_high_over = (p + 1) * T // 100\n            if (p + 1) * T % 100 == 0:\n                y_high_over -= 1\n                \n            x_min_overall = y_low_over - prev_sum\n            x_max_overall = y_high_over - prev_sum\n            \n            low_bound = max(x_low_cur, x_min_overall)\n            high_bound = min(x_high_cur, x_max_overall)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.add(p)\n            \n    for p in sorted(results):\n        print(p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array helps in quickly accessing the cumulative bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Checking Percentages**: For each percentage p from 0 to 100, the code checks each file to see if there exists a byte count x in the current file such that both the current and overall progress bars show p.\n4. **Range Validation**: For each file and p, the code calculates the valid range of bytes x for the current progress and the valid range of cumulative bytes for the overall progress.
