Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c for ax+by+c=0).\n The key observation: \n We are allowed to cross one road at a time, but note that crossing a road moves us from one block to an adjacent one. However, the problem states that we can only move in steps where the common border is nonzero. This means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (i.e., the common border is a part of one of the roads). \n\n But note: The problem is about moving between blocks. The entire plane is divided by the n lines. The home and university are in two blocks. We need the minimum number of steps (each step crosses one road) to get from home to university.\n\n Important: The movement is defined by crossing roads. However, note that if two roads are parallel, then they don't intersect, but they still separate the plane. Each road is a line.\n\n Observation: The problem is equivalent to determining the number of roads that separate the home from the university. However, note that sometimes you might cross a road twice? Actually, no, because the goal is to go from one block to another and each crossing of a road moves you to a neighboring block. But note: the problem says that in one step you can move from one block to another if the common border is nonzero. This implies that to get from home to university, we must cross every road that separates them. However, there's a catch: if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimum number of steps is k? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, consider: Each step crosses one road. But note: when you cross a road, you change your side (from one connected component to the other). The entire set of roads defines a planar graph. The minimal path in terms of crossings is the number of roads that separate the two points. However, note that two roads that are not parallel will intersect, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to cross both. In fact, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Why?\n\n Because each road is a linear equation. For each road, we can determine on which side of the road the home is and on which side the university is. If they are on the same side of a road, then that road does not separate them. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road.\n\n However, wait: what if two roads are crossed in the same step? No, because the step requires moving from one block to another via a common border (which is part of one road). So one step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n But wait: consider the example inputs.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n      Roads: 2\n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y = 0 (the x-axis)\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n   How many roads separate (1,1) and (-1,-1)? \n     For Road1 (y=0): \n        At (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 > 0 -> let's define a sign function: f(x,y) = a*x+b*y+c.\n        For the line equation: we can use the sign of (a*x+b*y+c). But note: the equation is given as aix+b iy+ci=0. We can define the side by the sign of the expression.\n\n        However, note: the sign depends on how we define the line. But we don't care about the sign as long as we are consistent.\n\n        For Road1: \n          Home: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n          University: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative.\n          So they are separated by Road1.\n\n        For Road2:\n          Home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n          University: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative.\n          So they are separated by Road2.\n\n        Therefore, two roads separate them. The answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n      Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n      Roads: 3\n        Road1: 1 0 0 -> x=0\n        Road2: 0 1 0 -> y=0\n        Road",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town. The key observation here is that each step involves crossing one road, and the minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many of the given lines (roads) separate the home and university points. Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. For a point to be separated by a line, it must lie on opposite sides of the line compared to the other point.\n2. **Intuition**: For each line, we check the side of the home and university points. If they lie on opposite sides, this line contributes to the separation between them, and thus requires crossing it once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each line, computing the sign of the line equation for both points, and counting how many lines have differing signs for the two points.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each line exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\( n \\) lines, the time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 300 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) or (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Processing Each Line**: For each road (line equation \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\)), the code evaluates the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the evaluations of the line equation at the two points yield opposite signs (one positive and one negative), the line separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating lines is printed, representing the minimum number of steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each line once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
