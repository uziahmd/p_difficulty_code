He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the trailing zeros are given by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n We know that the exponent of 5 in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n The problem: Given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the sample input m=1 gives output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n Why?\n   Let's compute Z(n) for n from 1 to 10:\n\n   n=1..4: Z(n)=0\n   n=5: Z(5)=1 -> first number with at least 1 trailing zero.\n   n=6: Z(6)=1 -> still 1\n   ...\n   n=9: Z(9)=1\n   n=10: Z(10)=2\n\n So, for m=1, the numbers n that have exactly 1 trailing zero are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n But note: the condition is \"exactly m\", so we don't include n=10 because then we have 2 trailing zeros.\n\n Observation: The function Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, it jumps at multiples of 5, and sometimes by more than one (like when n is a multiple of 25, then Z(n) increases by 2 or more).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, but actually we are going to consider the entire range.\n\n However, note that the problem asks for the number of n (k) and then the list of these n in increasing order.\n\n But note: m can be as large as 100000, and n can be very large (since Z(n) grows roughly as n/4, so n might be up to about 4*m? Actually, we know that Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/4, so n must be at least about 4*m. But m can be 100000, so n can be up to about 400000, which is acceptable for binary search? However, we cannot iterate over all n from 1 to 400000 if we do linear search.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the trailing zeros function Z(n) is non-decreasing and stepwise (increases only at multiples of 5). Therefore, the set of n with Z(n) = m is an interval (possibly empty) of consecutive integers.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Then, the largest n such that Z(n) == m is the maximum n for which Z(n)==m, and then the next n will have Z(n) > m.\n\n However, note: we want exactly m. So:\n\n   Let L = smallest integer such that Z(L) >= m.\n   Then, the numbers with Z(n) = m must be from L to R-1, where R is the smallest integer such that Z(R) >= m+1.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n with Z(n) = m? Then k=0 and we output nothing.\n\n However, note that Z(n) increases by at least 1 at every multiple of 5. But sometimes it increases by more (like at 25, 125, etc.). Therefore, it is possible that m is skipped.\n\n Example: m=2. \n   Z(10)=2, so m=2 is present.\n\n Example: m=3.\n   Z(15)=3, so m=3 is present.\n\n Example: m=4.\n   Z(20)=4, so m=4 is present.\n\n Example: m=5.\n   Z(25)= floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6. So between 20 and 24, Z(n) goes from 4 to 5? Let's check:\n\n   n=20: 4\n   n=21:4\n   n=22:4\n   n=23:4\n   n=24:4\n   n=25:6\n\n So m=5 is skipped.\n\n Therefore, the set of n with Z(n)=m might be empty.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can use binary search to find:\n\n   low_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n   high_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1\n\n Then, the numbers n satisfying Z(n)=m are the integers from low_bound to high_bound-1, provided that Z(low_bound)==m and Z(high_bound-1)==m.\n\n However, note that Z(n) is constant on intervals. So:\n\n   Let L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Then, we must check that Z(L) == m. Actually, if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   Let L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Then, the condition for having an interval is that Z(L) == m.\n\n   Similarly, let R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the set of n is [L, R-1] and the size is R - L.\n\n But note: what if m is very large and there's no n with Z(n)=m? Then L would be the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, and then we check Z(L) == m? Actually, if Z(L) != m, then there is no solution.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Step 2: Find R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, if Z(L) != m, then there are 0 numbers.\n\n   But wait: by definition, L is the smallest n with Z(n) >= m. It is possible that Z(L) > m? Yes, if m is skipped. Then we don't have any n with Z(n)=m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        If Z(L) != m, then k=0.\n\n   However, note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued. So if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n   Therefore, algorithm:\n\n   Define function Z(n): returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   We can compute Z(n) by:\n\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n\n   Now, we need to find L and R.\n\n   We can use binary search for L and R.\n\n   What is the range for n?\n\n   We know that Z(n) ~ n/4, so n should be at least 4*m (if m>0). But also, if m is 0, then we have to consider n from 1 to 4? Actually, m>=1 per input.\n\n   Lower bound for n: at least 0 (but since n positive, start from 0 or 1). We can set:\n\n        low = 0\n        high = 5*m   (because Z(5*m) = 5*m/5 + 5*m/25 + ... >= m, so 5*m is safe)\n\n   However, sometimes we might need to go higher? Actually, we know that Z(n) >= n/5 (since n/5 + n/25 + ... >= n/5). So we need n>=5*m? Actually, the minimal n for Z(n)=m is at most 5*m. But sometimes it's less (for example, m=1, then n=5). So we can set:\n\n        high = 5 * m * 5   # to be safe, but actually we can set high = 5 * m * 5^k? Alternatively, we can set high to 5*m (which is an upper bound for the minimal n? Actually, the minimal n for Z(n)=m is at most 5*m, because Z(5*m) = 5*m/5 + 5*m/25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... >= m. So 5*m is an upper bound for L.\n\n   But wait: for m=1, 5*1=5, and Z(5)=1 -> so L=5. For m=5, we know that the minimal n is 25? Actually, Z(25)=6, so we need to go beyond 25 to get Z(n)=5? Actually, we never get Z(n)=5. So we must adjust.\n\n   Actually, we want to find the minimal n such that Z(n)>=m. For m=5, Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 -> so minimal n for Z(n)>=5 is 25. Then we check Z(25)=6 !=5, so no solution.\n\n   So our plan:\n\n        Step 1: Binary search for L: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n        Step 2: Binary search for R: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Step 3: If Z(L) != m, then output 0.\n\n        Step 4: Otherwise, the numbers are from L to R-1, so there are (R-L) numbers.\n\n        Then output: \n            First line: (R - L)\n            Second line: L, L+1, ..., R-1\n\n   However, note: the problem requires to output the numbers in increasing order. But if the range is large (like 100000 numbers), then we cannot output each number one by one (because the range might be large, and m can be up to 100000, and the range for n might be from L to R-1, which could be up to 5 numbers? Actually, the gap between two consecutive zeros counts is usually small, except when we skip some m. In fact, the maximum gap (number of consecutive n with the same Z(n)) is 4? Because when we hit a multiple of 5, the zeros increase, and then until the next multiple of 5, the zeros remain the same.\n\n   But note: the zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in the number. For example, at 25 we add two zeros (so Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6). Then the numbers with Z(n)=5 do not exist.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n for a given m (if exists) is an interval of length at most 5? Actually, no: the zeros only change at multiples of 5, so between two multiples of 5, the zeros are constant. Therefore, the set for a given m (if exists) is a contiguous block of n that are not crossing a multiple of 5. However, the block might be interrupted by a jump? Actually, no: the zeros are constant between multiples of 5.\n\n   But note: the zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the set of n for which Z(n)=m is either empty or an interval [a, b] (with b-a+1 being the number of consecutive integers that yield the same m). How long is this interval?\n\n   Example: m=1: [5,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Why 5? Because from 5 to 9, the next multiple of 5 is 10.\n\n   In general, the zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5. So the length of the interval is 5, unless the next multiple of 5 is beyond the current value? Actually, the zeros increase at multiples of 5, so the zeros are constant from n to the next multiple of 5 minus one.\n\n   Therefore, the set for m (if exists) is an interval of length 5? Not necessarily. Consider m=0: then n from 1 to 4 (if we allowed m=0) would be 4 numbers. But m>=1.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m>=1.\n\n   But wait: what if m is large and we are at a multiple of a high power of 5? The zeros increase by more than one. Then the interval for the previous m might be shorter? Actually, the zeros jump by the number of factors of 5. So the gaps in the sequence of m values are the jumps. But the set for a particular m (if it exists) is an interval of consecutive n of length equal to the distance to the next multiple of 5? Actually, no.\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n      Z(n) is constant between multiples of 5. The next time it changes is at the next multiple of 5.\n\n      Therefore, the set for m (if exists) is an interval of consecutive integers that does not include a multiple of 5 (except the start, but wait: the start is a multiple of 5? Actually, the start is the first multiple of 5 that gives at least m zeros, and then until the next multiple of 5 minus one, the zeros remain the same.\n\n      Example: m=1: starts at 5 (which is a multiple of 5) and ends at 9 (which is the next multiple of 5 minus one). So the length is 5.\n\n      Example: m=2: starts at 10 (multiple of 5) and ends at 14 (next multiple of 5 is 15). So the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 -> 5 numbers.\n\n      Example: m=6: starts at 25 (which gives 6 zeros) and then goes until 29 (next multiple of 5 is 30). Then 25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   But wait, what if the next multiple of 5 is not the next integer? Actually, the zeros change only at multiples of 5. So the zeros are constant from a multiple of 5 (say k*5) to the next multiple of 5 (k*5+4). Then the interval length is always 5, unless the starting point is the last multiple of 5 (then we don't have a full cycle)? Actually, no: the starting point is defined by the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. This n might be any number, but note that the zeros only change at multiples of 5. Therefore, the set of n for which Z(n)=m must be a contiguous set of integers that are between two consecutive multiples of 5.\n\n   However, note: the zeros are non-decreasing and they only change at multiples of 5. Therefore, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is an interval [a, b] such that:\n\n        a is the smallest n with Z(n)=m, and b is the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) minus one.\n\n   And the length is (b - a + 1) = (next_multiple_of_5 - a) [because from a to next_multiple_of_5-1].\n\n   But note: a is a multiple of 5 (because if a were not, then Z(a) would be the same as Z(a-1) and we would have chosen a-1). Actually, no: the zeros are constant from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5. But the minimal n achieving Z(n)=m must be a multiple of 5? \n\n   Example: m=1: a=5 (multiple of 5).\n   Example: m=2: a=10 (multiple of 5).\n\n   Why must a be a multiple of 5? Because if n is not a multiple of 5, then Z(n)=Z(n-1). Therefore, the minimal n with Z(n)=m must be a multiple of 5 (unless m=0, but m>=1). \n\n   So the interval is from a (multiple of 5) to a+4 (the next multiple of 5 minus one). Then the length is 5.\n\n   But wait: what if the jump is more than one? For example, at 25, we jump from 4 to 6. Then for m=5, we don't have any n.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n for a given m (if exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n   However, consider m=0: then the set is from 1 to 4, which is 4 numbers. But m>=1.\n\n   But wait: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n   However, what if the minimal n for Z(n)=m is not a multiple of 5? Actually, because the zeros are constant between multiples of 5, the minimal n must be the smallest multiple of 5 that gives at least m zeros. \n\n   Therefore, the set is always an interval of 5 consecutive numbers, unless the minimal n is the last number in the block (i.e., the multiple of 5 is the last one we consider) but that doesn't happen because the next multiple of 5 is the next change.\n\n   However, wait: consider the example of m=6. The minimal n is 25 (which is a multiple of 5). Then the next multiple of 5 is 30. So the set is 25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   But what if the next multiple of 5 is not the immediate next? Actually, the zeros change at every multiple of 5, but the amount of zeros added at a multiple of 5 depends on the exponent of 5 in that number.\n\n   However, the key point is: the zeros are constant between two consecutive multiples of 5. Therefore, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is an interval that starts at a multiple of 5 and ends at the next multiple of 5 minus one, and the length is 5, unless the next multiple of 5 is beyond the last n that has Z(n)=m? Actually, no, because the zeros jump at the multiple of 5. So the zeros at the multiple of 5 become higher, and then we stop at the next multiple of 5 minus one.\n\n   But note: the next multiple of 5 is the next change. So the interval is always 5 numbers, unless the minimal n is already the last number of the block (but that can't be because the minimal n is the first multiple of 5 that achieves the zeros m). \n\n   However, wait: what if the minimal n is the last number of a block? Actually, the minimal n must be the first number of a block (which is a multiple of 5) because if you take a non-multiple, then the zeros are the same as the previous block, and the minimal n must be a multiple of 5.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n for m (if exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n   Let me test with m=0 (even though the problem says m>=1) just to see:\n\n        Z(0)=0, but n positive. For m=0, the set is n from 1 to 4 -> 4 numbers.\n\n   But m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says m>=1, but note that the minimal n for m=1 is 5, and the set is 5 numbers. But what about m=6? 5 numbers. \n\n   But wait: what if m=0? We don't have to handle. But note that the problem says m>=1.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the minimal n for m might not be the start of a full block? Actually, no: because the zeros are constant in the entire block. The minimal n is the first multiple of 5 that gives at least m zeros, and then the zeros remain the same until the next multiple of 5.\n\n   But note: the zeros might jump more than one at a multiple of 5. Then the set for m might be incomplete (if the jump skips m). But if m is achieved, then the set is 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n   However, wait: what if the minimal n is not the start of a block? Actually, the minimal n must be a multiple of 5, because the zeros only change at multiples of 5.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n with Z(n)=m (if it exists) is an interval of 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? Then the set is from 1 to 4 (which is 4 numbers). But m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, there is a problem: what if m is so large that the next multiple of 5 is beyond the maximum n we consider? Actually, we are using binary search and we set an upper bound (like 5*m*5) which is enough.\n\n   But note: the problem says m up to 100000. Then the minimal n for m=100000 is about 400000 (since Z(n) ~ n/4). We can compute Z(n) for n up to 500000.\n\n   However, we must design the binary search for L and R.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m*5   (or maybe 5*m*5 is not enough? Actually, we can set high = 5*m*5, but sometimes we need to go to 5*(m+1) to find R. Alternatively, we can set high = 5*m*5, but we must ensure that R is found within that.\n\n        We can set high = 5*m*5 + 100  (to be safe).\n\n   Alternatively, we can set high = 5*m + 1  for L? No, because for m=1, 5*m+1=6, but we need to go to 5 for L. Actually, we can set:\n\n        For L: we want the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n        We can set:\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m   # because Z(5*m) >= m (since Z(5*m) = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... >= m)\n\n        Similarly, for R: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1, we can set high = 5*(m+1) (which is an upper bound) or even 5*m+5.\n\n   However, sometimes we might need a larger n for R? For example, if m=5, then the minimal n for m+1=6 is 25 (because Z(25)=6). But 5*(m+1)=30, so that's safe.\n\n   But note: the minimal n for m+1 might be the same as the minimal n for m? Actually, no: because Z(n) is non-decreasing.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll write a helper function to compute Z(n):\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n        Then:\n\n            L = binary_search_low(m)   # smallest n with Z(n) >= m\n            R = binary_search_low(m+1)  # smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, if trailing_zeros(L) != m, then output 0.\n\n        Else, output (R - L) and then the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n   However, note: the set of n with Z(n)=m is [L, R-1]. But if we found L and R, then the numbers are L, L+1, L+2, ..., R-1.\n\n   Example: m=1 -> L=5, R=10 -> numbers: 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Example: m=5 -> L=25? Actually, no: because Z(25)=6, so the smallest n with Z(n)>=5 is 25 (because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6). Then we check Z(25)=6 !=5, so output 0.\n\n   Example: m=6 -> L=25, then Z(25)=6, and then R = smallest n with Z(n)>=7. Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7 -> so R=30. Then the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? We are not handling, but m>=1.\n\n   However, note: the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? Then we would set L = smallest n with Z(n)>=0 -> which is n=0 or n=1? Actually, n positive. The problem says positive integers. So for m=0, the set is n from 1 to 4. But since m>=1, we skip.\n\n   But note: the problem says m>=1.\n\n   However, the above reasoning leads to an interval of 5 numbers for every m that exists. But note: the set for m might be less than 5 if the next multiple of 5 is not the immediate next? Actually, no: the zeros change only at multiples of 5, so the set for m is from a multiple of 5 (L) to the next multiple of 5 minus one (R-1). The length is (R-1 - L + 1) = R - L.\n\n   But wait: how many numbers from L to R-1? It's (R-1 - L + 1) = R - L.\n\n   However, note: R is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Since Z(n) is constant from L to the next multiple of 5 (which is R) minus one, then Z(L) = m, and Z(L+1)=m, ... until Z(R-1)=m, and then Z(R) = m+1 (at least). So the length is R - L.\n\n   But note: the zeros are constant until the next multiple of 5, and the next multiple of 5 is R (if R is a multiple of 5). Actually, R is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1, and since zeros only change at multiples of 5, R must be a multiple of 5? Not necessarily: because the jump at a multiple of 5 might be more than one. For example, at 25 we jump from 4 to 6, so the next change (from 4 to 6) happens at 25, so for m=5, we don't have any n. But for m=6, R is the next multiple of 5? Actually, no: the next multiple of 5 after 25 is 30. But at 30, Z(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7. So the minimal n for m+1=7 is 30.\n\n   Therefore, R is the next change (the next multiple of 5) because the zeros increase at multiples of 5, and the amount of increase is determined by the factors of 5 in that number.\n\n   However, note: the zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in n. So the next change (the next multiple of 5) might be the next n where the zeros change, but the amount of change is variable.\n\n   But regardless, the set of n with Z(n)=m is [L, R-1] and the length is R-L.\n\n   But note: the set of n with Z(n)=m is an interval of consecutive integers, and the length is R-L.\n\n   However, the example m=1: R=10, L=5 -> length=5.\n\n   Example m=6: R=30, L=25 -> length=5.\n\n   Example m=7: \n        Z(30)=7, so L=30, then R = smallest n with Z(n)>=8. \n        Z(31)=7, Z(32)=7, Z(33)=7, Z(34)=7, Z(35)= floor(35/5)+floor(35/25)=7+1=8 -> so R=35.\n        Then the set is 30,31,32,33,34 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Example m=8:\n        L=35, R = smallest n with Z(n)>=9.\n        Z(35)=8, then Z(36)=8, ... until Z(40)= floor(40/5)+floor(40/25)=8+1=9 -> R=40.\n        Then the set is 35,36,37,38,39 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Example m=9:\n        L=40, R = smallest n with Z(n)>=10.\n        Z(40)=9, then Z(41)=9, ... until Z(45)= floor(45/5)+floor(45/25)=9+1=10 -> R=45.\n        Then the set is 40,41,42,43,44 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Example m=10:\n        L=45, R = smallest n with Z(n)>=11.\n        Z(45)=10, then Z(46)=10, ... until Z(50)= floor(50/5)+floor(50/25)+floor(50/125)=10+2+0=12 -> wait, so R=50? But then the set is 45 to 49, which is 5 numbers.\n\n   However, wait: Z(50)=12, so the minimal n for m+1=11 is 50? Then the set for m=10 is [45,49] (5 numbers). But what about m=11? Then L=50, and Z(50)=12, so we don't have m=11.\n\n   Therefore, the set for m (if exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n   But wait: what about m=0? Then we get 4 numbers, but m>=1.\n\n   However, note: the minimal n for m=0 is 0 or 1? But n positive, so from 1 to 4.\n\n   But wait: the zeros for n=0 is 0, but n positive. The problem says positive integers.\n\n   So the pattern: the set for m (if exists) is 5 consecutive numbers. But wait, what if the minimal n is not followed by 4 more? \n\n   Example: what if the next multiple of 5 is not the next integer? Actually, the next multiple of 5 is always 5 away. So the set is always 5 numbers.\n\n   However, wait: what if the minimal n is the last multiple of 5? Then the set would be from that multiple to the next multiple of 5 minus one. But that is still 5 numbers.\n\n   But what if m is 0? Then the minimal n is 0, but we don't have 0. So we start at 1. Then the set is 1,2,3,4 -> 4 numbers.\n\n   Since m>=1, we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says m>=1, but note that the set for m=1 is 5 numbers, for m=2 is 5, etc. But what if the minimal n for m is 0? No, because n positive.\n\n   But note: the minimal n for m=1 is 5, which is positive.\n\n   Therefore, the set for any existing m (>=1) is 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n   But wait: is that always true? Let me consider m=100000.\n\n   The minimal n for m=100000 is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100000.\n\n   We can compute n by: n = 5 * m * 5? Actually, we can approximate: Z(n) ~ n/4, so n ~ 4*m. Then the set is from n0 to n0+4, where n0 is the smallest multiple of 5 >= 4*m (approximately). Then the length is 5.\n\n   Therefore, we can assume that if the set exists, it has exactly 5 numbers.\n\n   But wait, what if the set exists but the next multiple of 5 is not the immediate next? Actually, the zeros change only at multiples of 5, so the set must be 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n   However, note: the minimal n for m is a multiple of 5. Then the next multiple of 5 is n0+5, so the set is from n0 to n0+4 (5 numbers).\n\n   Therefore, we can output:\n\n        k = 5   (if the set exists)\n\n        Then the numbers: n0, n0+1, n0+2, n0+3, n0+4.\n\n   But wait, how do we get n0? n0 is L, the smallest n with Z(n)=m (if Z(L)=m). And we know that L is a multiple of 5.\n\n   However, the above examples show that the set is 5 consecutive numbers. So we can also say: the set for m (if exists) is the 5 numbers starting from L (a multiple of 5) to L+4.\n\n   But note: the next multiple of 5 is L+5, so the set is [L, L+4] (5 numbers).\n\n   Therefore, we can also compute the set without knowing R? \n\n        If we have L (the minimal n with Z(n)=m) and we know that the set is [L, L+4] (if Z(L)=m and Z(L+4)=m and Z(L+5)>m), then we can output [L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4].\n\n   However, note: we have defined R as the smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1. And we know that R = L+5? Not necessarily: because the zeros might jump at L+5 by more than one. \n\n   Example: if L is 25 (which gives 6 zeros), then L+5=30, and Z(30)=7. So R=30, which is L+5.\n\n   Example: if L is 50 (which gives 12 zeros), then L+5=55, and Z(55)= floor(55/5)+floor(55/25)+floor(55/125)=11+2+0=13. Then R=55, which is L+5.\n\n   But wait: what if the jump is more than one? For example, at 125, the zeros jump by 3 (because 125 has three factors of 5). Then the minimal n for m=Z(124) is 125? Actually, no: Z(124)= floor(124/5)+floor(124/25)+floor(124/125)=24+4+0=28. Then Z(125)=29+3=32? Actually, no: Z(125)= floor(125/5)+floor(125/25)+floor(125/125)=25+5+1=31. So the jump from 124 to 125 is 31-28=3.\n\n   Then, if m=29, is there a set? \n        We need Z(n)=29. \n        Z(124)=28, Z(125)=31. So there is no n with Z(n)=29 or 30.\n\n   Therefore, the set for m=28 is [120,124] (5 numbers) and for m=31 is [125,129] (5 numbers). \n\n   But wait: Z(120)= floor(120/5)+floor(120/25)+floor(120/125)=24+4+0=28.\n        Then Z(121)=28, Z(122)=28, Z(123)=28, Z(124)=28, Z(125)=31.\n\n   So the set for m=28 is [120,124] (5 numbers). Then the set for m=31 is [125,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily governed by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\) and the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( Z(R) \\geq m+1 \\). These bounds help us determine the range of \\( n \\) values where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Validation and Output**: If \\( Z(L) \\) is exactly \\( m \\), then all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\) will have \\( Z(n) = m \\). The count of such integers is \\( R - L \\). If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), it means no such \\( n \\) exists, and the output should reflect that.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m * 5\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    L = low\n    if trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low_r = 0\n    high_r = 5 * (m + 1) * 5\n    \n    while low_r < high_r:\n        mid_r = (low_r + high_r) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid_r) >= m + 1:\n            high_r = mid_r\n        else:\n            low_r = mid_r + 1\n            \n    R = low_r\n    count_n = R - L\n    print(count_n)\n    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n    print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (L)**: The binary search starts from 0 to an upper bound (5*m*5) to find the smallest \\( n \\) (L) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound (R)**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (R) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). This helps in determining the end of the range where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n4. **Validation and Output**: After finding L and R, the code checks if \\( Z(L) \\) is exactly \\( m \\). If not, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the count of numbers from L to R-1 and prints them in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
