Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line: n, l\n Then the next line: n integers (lantern positions)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        The required d must cover from 0 to the first lantern. So we need at least (first lantern position) / 2.\n    - The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l (which is the end). Similarly, we need at least (l - last lantern) / 2.\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a and b, the gap in the middle is (b - a). \n        To cover this gap, we need a radius such that from the left lantern we cover up to the midpoint, and from the right lantern we cover from the midpoint to the right.\n        The required d for this gap would be (b - a) / 2.\n\n However, note: actually, we can think of it as the entire street must be covered. We can also consider that with a single lantern, the coverage is [x-d, x+d]. \n\n But note: the problem is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered.\n\n We can break the street into segments:\n\n  Segment 1: [0, a0] (where a0 is the smallest lantern position)\n  Segment 2: [a_i + d, a_{i+1} - d] ... but wait, let's think differently.\n\n Actually, the entire street is covered if:\n   - The leftmost lantern covers from 0 to a0 + d, so we require a0 + d >= 0 (trivial) and for the left side, we require d >= a0 (to cover from 0 to a0).\n   - Similarly, the rightmost lantern requires d >= l - a_last.\n\n But also, for two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the coverage from the left lantern goes to a_i + d, and from the right lantern starts at a_{i+1} - d. \n To have no gap, we require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which simplifies to 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. Therefore, we can set:\n\n   d_min = max( \n        a[0] / 2.0, \n        (l - a[-1]) / 2.0,\n        max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for all i from 0 to n-2 ) \n   )\n\n But wait, is that sufficient?\n\n Example: ['2 5\\n2 5'] -> n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n   d_min = max(2/2, (5-5)/2, (5-2)/2) = max(1.0, 0, 1.5) = 1.5? \n   But the sample output is 2.0.\n\n Let me reexamine the sample: \n   With d=1.5, the first lantern at 2 covers [2-1.5, 2+1.5] = [0.5, 3.5]. \n   The second lantern at 5 covers [5-1.5, 5+1.5] = [3.5, 6.5]. \n   However, the street is from 0 to 5. The point 0 is not covered by the first lantern (since 0.5 > 0) and the first lantern doesn't cover [0,0.5]. \n\n So what went wrong?\n\n Actually, for the left side: we require that the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least a0. That means d must be at least a0 (if we use the first lantern alone to cover 0). \n Similarly, for the right side, d must be at least (l - a_last). \n\n Now, for the gap between two lanterns, we require that the two adjacent lanterns together cover the entire gap. The condition is that the left lantern's coverage extends to at least a_i + d, and the right lantern's coverage starts at a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which is 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n However, note that the entire street might not be covered by just the two conditions above. But wait, the two conditions (left and right) are independent and the gaps are taken care of by the consecutive gaps.\n\n But in the example: \n   First lantern must have d >= 2 (to cover",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, and each lantern at position `a_i` lights all points within a distance `d` from it. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check End Conditions**: The street starts at 0 and ends at `l`. The leftmost part of the street (from 0 to the first lantern) requires that the first lantern's coverage extends back to 0. Similarly, the rightmost part (from the last lantern to `l`) requires the last lantern's coverage to extend forward to `l`.\n3. **Analyze Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light radii. Specifically, the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns should be covered by both lanterns' light, which translates to the condition that twice the light radius must be at least the distance between the two lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum light radius `d` is the maximum value derived from three conditions:\n   - The distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - Half the maximum distance between any two consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    positions.sort()\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l / 2.0))\n        return\n        \n    d_left = positions[0]\n    d_right = l - positions[-1]\n    d_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        if gap > d_gap * 2:\n            d_gap = gap / 2.0\n            \n    d_ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d_ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order, which simplifies gap analysis.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If there are no lanterns (`n == 0`), the entire street must be covered by a single lantern, so the radius is half the street length.\n4. **Calculating Coverage Requirements**:\n   - **Left Coverage (`d_left`)**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The lantern must cover this distance, so `d` must be at least `d_left`.\n   - **Right Coverage (`d_right`)**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). Similarly, `d` must be at least `d_right`.\n   - **Gap Coverage (`d_gap`)**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum half-distance between them determines the required radius to cover the gap between them without overlap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum radius `d` is the maximum value among `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_gap`, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.",
