The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are repeated cyclically. Let:\n   m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n In one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., when we have gone through a common multiple of m and k rounds?),\n but actually we don't need a common multiple for the entire game because we can break down the rounds by the least common multiple (LCM) of the two periods?\n However, note: in each round i (0-indexed), the move from A is A[(i * direction) % m] and from B is B[(i * direction) % k]. \n But wait, actually the rounds are independent: in round j, we use:\n   a_j = A[(j-1) % m]   [if we consider first round j=0: then index0, then j=1: index1, etc.] but note: the problem says the sequence is shown cyclically starting from the first one.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   \"Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ...\"\n\n So in round 1: index0 of A, round 2: index1 of A, ... round m: index m-1, round m+1: index0 again.\n\n Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n Therefore, for round i (starting at 0 for the first round):\n   A_index = i % m\n   B_index = i % k\n\n Then we compare A[i % m] and B[i % k] to determine the outcome.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We want to count the total losses for Nikephoros (when he loses) and for Polycarpus (when he loses) over n rounds.\n\n 2. How does one round work?\n    Let x = A[i % m], y = B[i % k]\n    The rules:\n        - Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n        - Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n        - Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n    So, if x == y: draw -> no red spot.\n\n    Else:\n        If x wins over y: then Polycarpus gets a red spot (because Nikephoros lost).\n        If y wins over x: then Nikephoros gets a red spot (because Polycarpus lost).\n\n    How to check who wins?\n        We can define a mapping or use a comparison function.\n\n    Alternatively, we can assign values to the items such that:\n        R > S, S > P, P > R.\n\n    One way is to map:\n        R -> 1, S -> 2, P -> 3, but then we need to adjust: actually, we want:\n        But note: the condition is cyclic. Another way is to use modulo arithmetic.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a dictionary or a function.\n\n    But note: we are going to do this for each round until n, which is too many.\n\n 3. We need to count without iterating n times (which is up to 2e9). \n\n 4. Idea: \n    Let T = LCM(m, k) -> but note: the rounds are independent and the pattern repeats every T rounds? \n    Actually, the state (index in A, index in B) repeats every T rounds (where T is the least common multiple of m and k). \n\n    However, we must be cautious: in round i, the indices are i%m and i%k. The pair (i%m, i%k) will repeat every T rounds (with T = LCM(m,k)), because the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that the pair (i mod m, i mod k) has period LCM(m,k). \n\n 5. Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)\n\n    Step 2: But note: we are only playing n rounds, not necessarily a multiple of T.\n\n    Step 3: We can break the n rounds into complete cycles (each cycle of length T) and a remainder.\n\n    Step 4: For the complete cycles, we can precompute the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses (i.e., his move is beaten by Polycarpus) and the number of rounds where Polycarpus loses (i.e., his move is beaten by Nikephoros) in one cycle.\n\n    Step 5: Then, for the incomplete part (the first r rounds of the next cycle, where r = n % T), we simulate the rounds.\n\n    However, note: n can be very large (2e9",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to optimize the computation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a cyclic sequence of moves (rock, paper, scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined pattern of both sequences repeats every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Precompute LCM**: Calculate `T` as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This determines the period after which the game's outcomes repeat.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For one full cycle of `T` rounds, simulate all rounds to count the losses for each player. This allows us to know how many losses occur per cycle.\n   - **Partial Cycle Handling**: For the remaining rounds (if any) after complete cycles, simulate these rounds directly to count additional losses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by reducing the problem to simulating at most `T` rounds (where `T` is up to 1,000,000 for sequences of length 1000 each), making it feasible even for very large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    B_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    total_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    def get_winner(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return 0\n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 1  # Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n        else:\n            return -1  # Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n            \n    nike_red = 0\n    poly_red = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        idx_a = i % m\n        idx_b = i % k\n        res = get_winner(A_str[idx_a], B_str[idx_b])\n        if res == 1:\n            poly_red += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            nike_red += 1\n            \n    nike_red_total = nike_red * total_cycles\n    poly_red_total = poly_red * total_cycles\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idx_a = i % m\n        idx_b = i % k\n        res = get_winner(A_str[idx_a], B_str[idx_b])\n        if res == 1:\n            poly_red_total += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            nike_red_total += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{nike_red_total} {poly_red_total}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If either sequence is empty, the output is trivially \"0 0\" since no moves can be made.\n3. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths determines the cycle length `T` after which the game's outcomes repeat.\n4. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one cycle (up to `T` rounds), the code checks the outcome of the round (win, loss, or draw) and updates the loss counts for both players.\n5. **Total Losses Calculation**: Multiply the losses from one cycle by the number of complete cycles (`total_cycles`) and add the losses from the remaining rounds (`remainder`).\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for very large `n`.",
