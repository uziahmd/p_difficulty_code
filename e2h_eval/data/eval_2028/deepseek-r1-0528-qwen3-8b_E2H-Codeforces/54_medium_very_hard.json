Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices, from 3 to 10^5) and a (the target angle, from 1 to 180 degrees).\n\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from the regular convex n-gon) such that the angle formed by the two sides (v1-v2 and v3-v2) is as close as possible to 'a'. The angle is measured in degrees.\n\n Important: The polygon is regular and convex, with vertices numbered 1 to n clockwise.\n\n Observation:\n In a regular n-gon, the central angles between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n However, note that the angle at vertex v2 (which is one of the vertices) is an internal angle? Actually, the problem says: \n   \"the value (angle) should be minimum possible\"\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\" -> output \"2 1 3\" which corresponds to an angle of 45 degrees (since |45-67| < |90-67|). \n\n How do we compute the angle?\n\n Let's consider: \n   In a regular n-gon, the interior angle is ((n-2)/n)*180. But that is the angle between two adjacent sides if we consider the polygon's interior.\n\n However, note the problem: we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices. The angle is defined by two sides (v1-v2 and v3-v2) and the vertex v2.\n\n But note: the angle we form is not necessarily the interior angle of the polygon. It is an angle formed by three points. Since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 can be either:\n\n   Option 1: The reflex angle? Actually, no. The problem says the angle is formed by the two sides (with v2 as vertex). In a convex polygon, the interior angle is less than 180, but note: the problem does not specify whether we take the smaller or larger one. However, the example outputs suggest we are taking the smaller one (because 60 in triangle is the only possibility, and 45 in square is the smaller one).\n\n Actually, the problem says: the polygon is convex, so the angle at v2 can be measured in two ways: the one inside the polygon (the smaller one) and the one going the other way (the reflex). But note: the problem does not specify which one. However, looking at the examples:\n\n Example 1: n=3, a=15 -> output \"1 2 3\". The angle at vertex 2 for points 1,2,3 is 60 degrees. But wait, how is that computed?\n\n In a triangle, the angle at vertex 2 is the same as the polygon's interior angle (which is 60). \n\n Example 2: n=4, a=67 -> output \"2 1 3\": \n   This forms a triangle with vertices 1,2,3. In a square, the interior angle is 90, but here we are taking a different triangle: \n   Actually, the three points are consecutive? Then the angle at vertex 2 is 90 - (the central angle / 2) ? \n\n Alternatively, we can think geometrically: \n   In a square, the side from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3 are adjacent sides. The angle between them is the interior angle, 90 degrees.\n\n But wait, the example output for n=4, a=67 is \"2 1 3\", and they say that 45 is chosen because |45-67| < |90-67|. \n\n How do we get 45? \n\n Consider: if we take three vertices that are not consecutive? Actually, the example says: \n   \"Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only.\"\n\n How to get 45? \n   Example: In square with vertices labeled 1,2,3,4 (clockwise), then consider vertices 1,2,4. The angle at vertex 2: \n      Point 1 and 2: edge from 2 to 1, and edge from 2 to 4. \n      The vector from 2 to 1 is (left-up if we imagine the square with 1 at top-left, 2 top-right, etc.? Actually, let's label: \n        1: (0,1), 2: (1,1), 3: (1,0), 4: (0,0) [if we center the square at origin?] \n\n   But note: the problem states the vertices are numbered clockwise.\n\n   Another way: the angle can be formed by skipping some vertices. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the three distinct vertices. So we can choose any three.\n\n   In a square, the possible angles at a vertex are:\n     If we choose two adjacent edges (like 2 connected to 1 and 3) then the angle is 90.\n     If we choose two edges that are separated by one vertex (so from vertex 2: connect to 1 and 4) then the angle is 45? \n\n   Why 45? Because the two edges (2->1 and 2->4) form two sides that are actually the diagonals of the square? No, wait: in a square, from vertex 2, the edges to 1 and 4 are not adjacent. Actually, in a square, the edges from a vertex are only two: to the two adjacent vertices. But wait, we can also consider the polygon's sides and the chords? \n\n   Actually, note: the problem does not restrict to edges of the polygon. It says three distinct vertices. So the sides of the angle do not have to be edges of the polygon. They can be any chords.\n\n   However, note: the polygon is convex, so the angle is well-defined and we can use the circle to compute the angle.\n\n   Alternate approach: use the inscribed angle theorem? Or use the fact that the angle at vertex v2 is determined by the two arcs from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the angle to be the interior angle of the polygon. It is simply the angle formed by three points.\n\n   However, there is a known method: \n\n   Consider the circle passing through the three points (which is unique for three non-collinear points). The angle at v2 is half the difference of the arcs (but this is for cyclic polygons).\n\n   Actually, in a regular polygon, all vertices lie on a circle. So the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). \n\n   The inscribed angle is half the central angle subtended by the same arc. But wait, we have two arcs: the one from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3? \n\n   Actually, the angle at v2 is the angle between the chords v2v1 and v2v3. \n\n   There is a formula: \n        angle = 180 - (arc length from v1 to v3 via the opposite side) / 2   ??? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the three points. However, the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, so the chord lengths are determined by the central angles.\n\n   Let the central angle between two adjacent vertices be c = 360/n.\n\n   Then the central angle between two vertices separated by k steps is k * c.\n\n   Now, the chord length between two vertices separated by k steps is 2 * r * sin(k * c / 2), but we don't need the chord length.\n\n   The angle at vertex v2 (inscribed angle) for the triangle (v1, v2, v3) is half the difference of the arcs? \n\n   Actually, the standard formula for an inscribed angle is: \n        angle = (arc_length) / (2 * total circle) * 360? \n\n   But note: the angle at v2 is the angle between the two chords. There are two arcs from v1 to v3: the minor and major. The inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is opposite to it. \n\n   However, in our case, the angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle, which is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2). \n\n   The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n   But wait, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that doesn't contain v2). \n\n   Therefore, the angle = (arc from v1 to v3) / 2.\n\n   However, note: the arc from v1 to v3 can be measured in two ways: the minor arc and the major arc. The inscribed angle uses the intercepted arc (which is the one that the angle \"sees\"). In a convex polygon, the arc that is intercepted by the angle at v2 (without crossing the polygon) is the one that is opposite to the polygon's interior.\n\n   But note: the three points are distinct and the polygon is convex. The angle we are considering is the one that is inside the circle? Actually, the angle at v2 is always the one that is the smaller one (unless we consider the reflex angle, but the problem doesn't specify). However, the problem says \"as close as possible\", so we might consider both possibilities? \n\n   Let me check: In the square example, if we take vertices 1,2,3 (consecutive) then the intercepted arc from 1 to 3 (via the interior) is 180 degrees (because from vertex 1 to 3, going the long way around the square? Actually, no: in a square, the central angle for two adjacent vertices is 90, so from 1 to 3 (adjacent to 2) is two steps: 180 degrees. Then the inscribed angle would be 180/2 = 90 degrees.\n\n   Now, if we take vertices 1,2,4 (in a square with vertices 1,2,3,4 clockwise): \n        From 1 to 4: the minor arc is 90 degrees (if we go from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, that's 270, but the minor arc is from 1 to 4 directly, which is one step: 90 degrees). \n        Then the angle at 2 would be half of the intercepted arc? But wait, the angle at 2 is formed by points 1,2,4. The intercepted arc is from 1 to 4 (the one not containing 2). In the circle, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the minor arc (90 degrees). Then the angle would be 45 degrees.\n\n   So the formula: \n        Let d be the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2). Then the angle at v2 is d/2.\n\n   But note: the central angle d must be the one that is the intercepted arc (the one opposite to the angle). \n\n   However, we must ensure that the arc we choose is the one that is intercepted. In a convex polygon, the three points are in order (either clockwise or counterclockwise). \n\n   Steps:\n\n   We are to choose three distinct vertices. Without loss of generality, we can fix the middle vertex v2. Then we consider two other vertices: one to the left (counterclockwise) and one to the right (clockwise). \n\n   But note: the problem does not require the angle to be the interior one, but the one formed by the two sides. However, the angle is uniquely determined by the three points (and in a circle, the inscribed angle is fixed for a given arc).\n\n   How to iterate?\n\n   Since n can be up to 10^5, we cannot iterate over all triplets.\n\n   Alternative approach:\n\n   We know that the angle is d/2, where d is the central angle of the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that doesn't contain v2). \n\n   But note: the central angle d must be between 0 and 360. And the angle we get is d/2, so it can be between 0 and 180.\n\n   Also, note that the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) must be the one that goes the long way or the short way? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the intercepted arc (which is the one that the angle \"sees\", i.e., the arc opposite to the angle). In our case, the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords, and the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not include v2.\n\n   Therefore, the central angle d for the intercepted arc is the one that is the shorter arc? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In a convex polygon, the angle we are forming is the one that is less than 180 (unless we consider the reflex, but the problem does not specify). \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"three distinct vertices\", and the polygon is convex, so the three points form a triangle. The triangle's angle is always less than 180 (because the polygon is convex, the triangle is entirely contained in the polygon and the angle at v2 is the one facing away from the center? Actually, no: the angle at v2 in the triangle is the one that is inside the triangle, and since the polygon is convex, the triangle is also convex, so the angle is less than 180.\n\n   But wait, the inscribed angle theorem gives two possibilities: \n        angle = (arc) / 2, where arc is the intercepted arc (which is the one opposite to the angle). However, the intercepted arc can be the minor or the major? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (if the angle is less than 180). \n\n   However, note: the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2. In a circle, the arc from v1 to v3 has two possibilities: the minor and the major. The inscribed angle is half the minor arc if the angle is less than 180, and half the major arc if the angle were greater than 180? But our angle is always taken as the smaller one (the triangle's angle is always the smaller one).\n\n   Actually, the inscribed angle is always half the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In our case, the intercepted arc is the one that is the set of points on the circle that are \"seen\" by the angle. For the angle to be the one we want (the one that is in the triangle), the intercepted arc is the one that is the set of points on the circle that are not in the two segments (v2v1 and v2v3). \n\n   But note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. The central angle for that arc is the number of edges (or steps) from v1 to v3 in that direction multiplied by (360/n).\n\n   How to relate the central angle d to the angle at v2?\n        angle = d/2.\n\n   However, note: if we take the minor arc from v1 to v3 (which is the one that contains the center? not necessarily) then d is the minor arc. But the angle at v2 is always the minor arc? Actually, no: the angle at v2 is the minor arc divided by 2 only if the minor arc is the one we are intercepting. \n\n   Let me clarify with the square example:\n\n        Case 1: v1, v2, v3 are consecutive: \n            v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v3 = 3.\n            The intercepted arc from 1 to 3 (not containing 2) is the arc from 1 to 3 that goes the long way (because the short way would pass through 2). Wait, no: the intercepted arc is the one that the angle at 2 sees, which is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2. In the square, the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2 is the one that goes from 1 to 4 to 3, which is 180 degrees (because two sides: 90+90). Then the angle at 2 would be 180/2 = 90.\n\n        Case 2: v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v3 = 4.\n            The intercepted arc from 1 to 4 (not containing 2) is the arc from 1 to 4 that goes the short way (one step, 90 degrees). Then the angle at 2 is 90/2 = 45.\n\n   So the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, and it can be either the minor or the major arc. But note: the inscribed angle is defined for the intercepted arc that is the one that the angle \"sees\", and that is the arc that is opposite to the angle. In the first case, the angle is 90, and the intercepted arc is 180. In the second case, the angle is 45, and the intercepted arc is 90.\n\n   Therefore, the angle at v2 is always the minor arc divided by 2? Not exactly: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle, and it is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. That arc can be the minor or the major. \n\n   However, note: the angle at v2 must be the smaller angle (because the polygon is convex and the triangle is inside the circle). The angle at v2 in the triangle is the one that is less than 180. And the inscribed angle formula uses the intercepted arc that is the one that is opposite (which is the one not containing the vertex). \n\n   But there is a catch: the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the one that is the set of points on the circle that are between the two chords (if we draw the two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3). In a convex polygon, the two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 will divide the circle into two arcs: the one that is the intercepted arc (which is the one that is opposite to the angle) and the one that is the rest. The intercepted arc is the one that is not containing the center? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain the vertex v2.\n\n   Therefore, the central angle d for the intercepted arc is the one that is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, and then the angle at v2 is d/2.\n\n   However, note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc d must be less than 360. And the angle at v2 is d/2, which is between 0 and 180.\n\n   So the problem reduces to: \n        We need to consider for each vertex v2, two sets of vertices: those to the left (counterclockwise) and those to the right (clockwise). Then we consider pairs (v1, v3) such that v1 is on one side and v3 on the other, and then the intercepted arc is the one from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n   But note: the vertices are arranged in a circle. We can fix v2 at position 0 (by rotation). Then we can consider two sequences: the vertices to the left (in decreasing index) and the vertices to the right (in increasing index). But note: the polygon is cyclic.\n\n   However, the problem is symmetric. We are to minimize |angle - a|, where angle = d/2, and d is the central angle of the intercepted arc (which is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2).\n\n   Note: the intercepted arc d can be expressed in terms of the number of edges between v1 and v3 in the direction that does not contain v2. \n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n        Let the polygon have vertices 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 (we'll use 0-indexed for calculation).\n\n        For a fixed vertex v2, we can consider two directions: \n          left: from v2, going backwards (clockwise if we consider the numbering clockwise? Actually, the problem says clockwise. Our array is in clockwise order. So from v2, the next vertex in clockwise is (v2+1) % n, and the previous is (v2-1) % n.\n\n        But note: the angle is determined by the two points: one on the left and one on the right.\n\n        Actually, the two points can be arbitrarily chosen from the entire polygon (except v2). However, the best candidate angles are going to be near the target angle.\n\n        But note: the angle is d/2, and d is the central angle of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. \n\n        The central angle for two points separated by k steps is k * (360/n). The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. \n\n        How to compute d for two points v1 and v3 relative to v2?\n\n        Without loss of generality, fix v2 at 0. Then the other vertices are at positions 1, 2, ..., n-1.\n\n        Consider two points: one at position i (to the right, so i from 1 to n-1) and one at position j (to the left, so j from n-1 down to 1). But note: the intercepted arc from i to j (not containing 0) is the arc that goes from i to j without passing through 0. \n\n        However, if we have two points i and j (with i in the positive direction and j in the negative direction from 0), then the intercepted arc is the arc that goes from i to j that does not contain 0. Since the circle is continuous, there are two arcs from i to j: one that goes through 0 and one that does not. The one that does not contain 0 is the one that goes from i to j by decreasing the index until j (if i < j then the arc that goes from i to j without 0 is the long way around? Actually, no: if i and j are both on the same side of 0 (like both positive) then the arc that does not contain 0 is the one that goes from i to j without passing through 0, which is the direct arc if i and j are on the same side? \n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          Let d1 = the central angle from v1 to v2 (the arc from v1 to v2, in the direction of increasing indices) and d2 = the central angle from v2 to v3 (the arc from v2 to v3, in the direction of increasing indices). Then the intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is the arc from v1 to v3 that goes the long way: 360 - (d1 + d2) ? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          The entire circle is 360. The two arcs from v1 to v3: one is the sum of the central angles from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 (if we go from v1 to v3 passing through v2, then the other arc is 360 minus that). \n\n        But wait, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so if we go from v1 to v3 without passing through v2, then the central angle for that arc is the entire circle minus the central angle from v1 to v3 passing through v2.\n\n        The central angle from v1 to v3 passing through v2 is the sum of the central angles from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3. \n\n        Then the intercepted arc d = 360 - (central_angle(v1, v2) + central_angle(v2, v3))\n\n        However, note: the central_angle(v1, v2) is the minimum of (|v1 - v2| * (360/n), 360 - |v1 - v2|*(360/n))? Actually, no: the central angle between two vertices is the absolute difference in indices times (360/n), but we have to take the minimum arc between the two.\n\n        But wait, the central angle between two vertices is defined as the smallest arc connecting them. However, for the intercepted arc, we are using the arc that does not contain v2, which might be the major arc.\n\n        Actually, we have to be careful: the central angle for the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. This arc is the entire circle minus the arc from v1 to v3 that does contain v2 (if we consider the circle). \n\n        The arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the one that goes from v1 to v2 to v3. The central angle for that arc is the central angle from v1 to v2 (the shortest? or the one along the path?) plus the central angle from v2 to v3? \n\n        But note: the central angle between two vertices is the smallest arc. However, when we traverse from v1 to v3 via v2, we are going along a specific path. The central angle for the entire path from v1 to v3 via v2 is the sum of the central angles from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3, but these central angles are the minor arcs for each segment.\n\n        However, if the minor arc from v1 to v2 is the one that goes through the increasing indices, then the central angle for the segment from v1 to v2 is (min(|v1-v2|, n-|v1-v2|)) * (360/n). But wait, that is the minor arc. \n\n        But in our intercepted arc, we are not taking the minor arc, we are taking the arc that does not contain v2. \n\n        Let me reframe: \n\n          Let the positions of the vertices be 0 to n-1 (0-indexed) and fix v2 at 0.\n\n          Let v1 be at position i (i from 1 to n-1) and v3 be at position j (j from 1 to n-1). \n\n          Then the two arcs from v1 to v3 are:\n\n            Arc1: from i to j going forward (increasing index) without wrapping around 0: the central angle is (j - i) * (360/n) if j>=i, but if j < i then we wrap around: (j - i + n) * (360/n) -> but that is the minor arc? Actually, the minor arc is the minimum between (j-i) mod n and (i-j) mod n.\n\n          However, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0. \n\n          How to determine the intercepted arc? \n\n          The intercepted arc is the set of points on the circle from v1 to v3 that do not include 0. \n\n          We can break the circle at 0. Then the circle is split into two arcs: the positive direction (from 0 to n-1) and the negative direction (from 0 to 1, then 2,...). \n\n          Now, the two points i and j can be in either part.\n\n          Case 1: i and j are both in [1, n-1] (so not 0). Then the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the arc that goes from i to j without crossing 0. \n\n          This arc is the one that is the smaller of the two if the entire arc from i to j (in the positive direction) does not cross 0? \n\n          Actually, we can compute the two arcs:\n\n            Option A: the arc from i to j in the positive direction (without wrapping): central angle = (j - i) * (360/n) if j>=i, but if j < i then we have to consider the positive direction as going from i to n-1 and then from 0 to j? \n\n          Alternatively, we can map the circle to [0, 360). Each vertex k has a central angle: k * (360/n).\n\n          Then the central angle from i to j (the minor arc) is min(|i - j|, n - |i - j|) * (360/n). \n\n          But note: the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain 0. \n\n          We can compute the central angle for the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 by:\n\n            Let d1 = the central angle from i to 0 (minor arc) = min(i, n-i) * (360/n)\n            Let d2 = the central angle from 0 to j (minor arc) = min(j, n-j) * (360/n)\n\n          Then the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the entire circle minus the minor arc from i to j? \n\n          Actually, no. The entire circle is 360. The two arcs from i to j are: \n            arc1 = minor_arc(i, j) = min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|) * (360/n)\n            arc2 = 360 - minor_arc(i, j)\n\n          But which one does not contain 0? \n\n          We need to check if 0 lies on the minor arc from i to j. \n\n          The minor arc from i to j is the one with length = minor_arc(i, j). We can also compute the two arcs from i to j: one passing through 0 and one not.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider the positions. \n\n          Let's assume we fix v2 at 0. Then the circle is broken at 0. The arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the arc that goes from i to j without passing through 0. \n\n          This arc exists if and only if i and j are on the same side of 0? Actually, no: even if they are on opposite sides, we can take the arc that goes the long way.\n\n          Actually, the condition for the arc from i to j not containing 0 is that 0 is not strictly between i and j in the circular ordering (considering the circle broken at 0). \n\n          We can break the circle at 0 and then consider two linear segments: [0, n) and [0, n) again. But note: the circle is cyclic.\n\n          Instead, we can do:\n\n          Let the positions be modulo n. Then the arc from i to j (without containing 0) is the one that goes from i to j without passing through 0. \n\n          We can compute the two ways:\n\n            Way1: from i to j going forward (increasing index) without wrapping: if i <= j, then the arc is from i to j, and 0 is not in between if i>0 and j<n? Actually, 0 is at the beginning, so if i>0 and j<n, then 0 is not in the open interval (i, j) in the linear sense. But in the circle, the arc from i to j (forward) does not contain 0 if i and j are both in (0, n) and i<=j, then the forward arc does not contain 0 (because 0 is at the beginning). Similarly, if i>j, then the forward arc from i to j would wrap around and include 0.\n\n          This becomes messy.\n\n   Let me try a different approach:\n\n   Since the polygon is regular, we can precompute all possible angles (which are multiples of 360/n) and then look for the one closest to a.\n\n   However, the number of distinct angles is O(n^2) which is too many (n up to 10^5).\n\n   We must find an efficient solution.\n\n   Insight:\n\n   The angle at vertex v2 is determined by the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The angle is (360 - d) / 2, where d is the central angle of the intercepted arc? Actually, wait: the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. And the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). \n\n   But note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc is d, then the angle is d/2.\n\n   However, we have two possibilities for d: the intercepted arc could be the minor or the major? Actually, the intercepted arc is fixed: it is the one that does not contain v2.\n\n   But note: the angle must be less than 180 (because d is at most 360, so d/2 is at most 180). And the angle is always positive.\n\n   How can we generate candidate angles?\n\n   The angle is d/2, and d is a multiple of (360/n). Specifically, d = k * (360/n) for some integer k (from 1 to n-1). Then the angle is (k * 180) / n.\n\n   But note: k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc? Actually, the central angle is k*(360/n), so k can be from 1 to n-1.\n\n   However, the intercepted arc must not contain v2, and the arc from v1 to v3 is determined by the two points. The value k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc? \n\n   Actually, the central angle d is the arc length (in degrees) from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). The number of edges spanned by the arc is k, so d = k*(360/n). But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is the arc that spans k edges, meaning there are k edges and k+1 vertices (including v1 and v3). But the central angle is k*(360/n) because each edge is 360/n.\n\n   Therefore, the angle is (k * 180) / n.\n\n   Now, we are to find an integer k (from 1 to n-1) such that (k * 180 / n) is as close as possible to a.\n\n   But wait: is that the only possibility? \n\n   However, note: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to v2, and the two points v1 and v3 must be distinct and not v2. \n\n   But also note: the angle can be formed by two points that are not necessarily separated by k edges in the intercepted arc. Actually, the intercepted arc is defined by the two points, and the central angle is the arc between them (not containing v2). \n\n   But the above formula gives the angle as (k * 180) / n. However, k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc. \n\n   But note: the same angle can be achieved by different k.\n\n   However, is every multiple of (180/n) achievable? \n\n   Example: n=4 -> multiples of 45: 45, 90, 135, 180 (but k from 1 to 3: 45,90,135). \n\n   In the square, we saw that we can achieve 45 and 90. \n\n   Therefore, the set of achievable angles is { (k * 180) / n for k in [1, floor((n-1)/2)] }? \n\n   Actually, note: the intercepted arc can be any arc from 1 to n-1 edges. However, the angle is d/2 = (k*360/n)/2 = (k*180)/n.\n\n   But wait, what if we consider the arc in the other direction? The angle is defined by the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is uniquely defined (the one not containing v2). \n\n   However, note: the angle at v2 is the same regardless of the direction of the arc? \n\n   Example: In the square, the angle 45 is achieved by k=1 (arc of 360/4 = 90 degrees) -> angle = 45. And the angle 90 is achieved by k=2 (arc of 180 degrees) -> angle = 90.\n\n   But note: k cannot be 0 (arc of 0) and k cannot be n (arc of 360, which is the whole circle, then angle=180, but the intercepted arc for the whole circle doesn't make sense for three distinct points).\n\n   Therefore, the candidate angles are (k * 180 / n) for k in the range [1, n-1].\n\n   However, note: the same angle can be achieved by two different k? \n\n   But observe: (k * 180 / n) = ((n-k) * 180 / n) only if k = n-k -> only when n=2k, i.e., n even and k = n/2. But then (n/2 * 1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves leveraging the properties of regular polygons and their angles to efficiently determine the closest possible angle without exhaustive search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle Calculation**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\) degrees. The angle formed at any vertex (v2) by two other vertices (v1 and v3) is determined by the intercepted arc between v1 and v3, which does not include v2. The measure of this angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc, i.e., \\( \\frac{k \\times 180}{n} \\) degrees, where \\( k \\) is the number of edges in the intercepted arc.\n\n2. **Finding the Closest Angle**: The goal is to find an integer \\( k \\) (ranging from 1 to \\( n-1 \\)) such that \\( \\frac{k \\times 180}{n} \\) is closest to the given angle 'a'. This involves calculating the absolute difference between each possible angle and 'a' to identify the minimal difference.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Special considerations include when the computed angle might be exactly 'a' or when multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal difference. In such cases, any valid triplet of vertices can be chosen.\n\n4. **Vertex Selection**: Once the optimal \\( k \\) is determined, the corresponding vertices are selected. For \\( k \\), the vertices are chosen such that the intercepted arc spans \\( k \\) edges, ensuring the angle condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for k in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = (k * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n            \n    angle1 = (best_k * 180) / n\n    angle2 = (best_k * 360) / n\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = (v2 + best_k) % n\n    if v1 == 0:\n        v1 = n\n    else:\n        v1 = v1 % n\n        \n    v3 = (v2 - best_k) % n\n    if v3 == 0:\n        v3 = n\n    else:\n        v3 = v3 % n\n        \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, \\( n \\) (number of vertices) and \\( a \\) (target angle), read from standard input.\n2. **Finding Optimal Angle**: The loop iterates over possible values of \\( k \\) (from 1 to \\( n-1 \\)), computes the corresponding angle, and checks its proximity to 'a'. The minimal difference identifies the best \\( k \\).\n3. **Vertex Calculation**: Using the optimal \\( k \\), the vertices v1 and v3 are determined relative to v2. The positions are adjusted modulo \\( n \\) to ensure they lie within the valid vertex range (1 to \\( n \\)).\n4. **Output**: The vertices v1, v2, and v3 are printed, forming the desired angle configuration.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space by leveraging mathematical properties of regular polygons, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
