He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the trailing zeros are given by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n We know that the exponent of 5 in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n The problem: Given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, it is not strictly increasing. For example, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\n So for a given m, we are looking for all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require n to be consecutive. But observe:\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then for a fixed m, the values of n for which f(n)=m form an interval [a, b-1] (if we consider that f(n) increases at multiples of 5).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (call this lower_bound) and the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1 (call this upper_bound). Then the numbers n with Z(n)=m are from (lower_bound) to (upper_bound - 1).\n\n 2. But note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n (k) and then the list of these k integers in increasing order.\n\n However, note that m can be up to 100000. And the n we are dealing with might be very large (since Z(n) grows as n/5 + n/25 + ... ~ n/4, so n ~ 4*m). But actually, we can use binary search to find the bounds.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Then print these k integers in increasing order\". If k is large (for example, if m=1, then n from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers) then we cannot output each one individually if k is huge.\n\n Observation: The set of n with Z(n)=m is contiguous? Actually, yes. Because the function Z(n) is constant between the points where n is a multiple of 5. However, wait: when n increases, Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. So for a given m, the set of n for which Z(n)=m is an interval (possibly empty).\n\n However, note: sometimes there might be no solution. For example, m=0: but the problem states m>=1. Also, note that Z(n) jumps by more than 1 sometimes (e.g., at n=25, Z(25)=6, but Z(24)=4, so from 24 to 25, we jump from 4 to 6). Therefore, there might be gaps.\n\n Actually, let's check:\n\n   We want Z(n)=m.\n\n   But note: the function Z(n) is defined as the sum of floor(n/5^i) for i=1,2,...\n\n   The key is: the set of n such that Z(n)=m is the set of n in the interval [L, R-1] where L is the smallest n with Z(n)=m and R is the smallest n with Z(n)=m+1.\n\n   However, sometimes there is no n such that Z(n)=m. For example, m=3: \n\n        Z(15)= floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3.\n        Z(16)=3, Z(17)=3, Z(18)=3, Z(19)=3, Z(20)=4.\n\n        So m=3 is present.\n\n   But what about m=4?\n\n        Z(20)=4, so yes.\n\n   However, consider m=5:\n\n        Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6.\n\n        So m=5 is missing.\n\n   Similarly, m=26: \n\n        We can compute, but the point is: the sequence of zeros counts is non-decreasing and the steps can skip some numbers.\n\n   Therefore, we must first check if there exists any n such that Z(n)=m",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) for a given \\( m \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid numbers \\( n \\) will lie between these bounds, inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no \\( n \\) exists such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), we output 0. Otherwise, we list all numbers from the lower bound to the upper bound minus one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 10)  # A safe upper bound estimate\n\n    def zeta(x):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while x >= divisor:\n            count += x // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    # Find lower bound: smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeta(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    lower_bound = low\n\n    # Find upper bound: smallest n such that Z(n) >= m + 1\n    high = 5 * (m + 10)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeta(mid) < m + 1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    upper_bound = low\n\n    if zeta(lower_bound) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    k = upper_bound - lower_bound\n    res = list(range(lower_bound, upper_bound))\n    \n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n    else:\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which is expected to contain a single integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: Two binary searches are performed to find the bounds for \\( n \\):\n   - The first search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - The second search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\).\n3. **Checking Validity**: After determining the bounds, we check if the lower bound indeed has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, there are no solutions, and we output 0.\n4. **Output**: The number of valid integers \\( n \\) is the difference between the upper and lower bounds. These integers are listed in increasing order, separated by spaces.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
