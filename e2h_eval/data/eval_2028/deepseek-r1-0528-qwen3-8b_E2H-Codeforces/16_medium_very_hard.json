Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The problem is about moving between blocks (regions) by crossing roads. However, note that we can only move between two blocks if they share a common border of nonzero length. This means we cross one road at a time.\n\n But note: the problem says that two blocks are adjacent (and you can move in one step) if they share a common border of nonzero length. In the context of lines, two regions (blocks) are separated by a line (road). Crossing a single road moves you from one block to an adjacent one.\n\n However, the twist is that the movement is defined such that you can only move between two blocks if they share a common border (so you must cross one road). Therefore, each road crossing is a step.\n\n But wait: the problem asks for the minimum number of steps to get to the university.\n\n Alternate interpretation: The entire plane is divided by n lines. Each region is a convex polygon (or unbounded) and the boundaries are segments of these lines. The home and university are in two different regions. The movement is allowed by crossing roads (lines). However, note that you can cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: in one step you move from one block to another, meaning you cross one road (the common border). But actually, the common border is part of one road. So each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\n However, note that two regions might be separated by multiple roads, but the minimal path from home to university might require crossing some set of roads. But observe: the roads are linear and the plane is divided into regions. The problem is similar to the following: if we consider the arrangement of lines, then the regions are defined by which side of each line they lie on.\n\n We can assign to each road i a sign for home and for university. For road i: \n   For home: s1 = sign(a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i)\n   For university: s2 = sign(a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i)\n\n Then, if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then we don't need to cross that road. Otherwise, we do.\n\n But note: the problem does not allow crossing multiple roads at once. However, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the home from the university? Not exactly: because when you cross one road, you change the side for that road, and then the next road crossing changes the side for the next road.\n\n Actually, consider: the entire journey from home to university must cross a road whenever the two points lie on opposite sides of that road. Moreover, each time we cross a road, we flip the side for that road. And we can only cross one road at a time.\n\n However, is it possible that we have to cross a road more than once? No, because once you cross a road, you are on the other side and you don't need to cross it again to get to the target (unless the target is on the original side, but then we would have crossed it twice?).\n\n Actually, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that have the home and university on opposite sides. Because for each such road, we must cross it an odd number of times (at least once) to go from home to university. And we can arrange the crossings so that we cross each road at most once.\n\n However, wait: what if the home and university are separated by two roads, and the two roads are arranged such that you cannot cross both without being blocked? Actually, the problem says that the movement is defined by nonzero common borders. But note: the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions, and the regions are connected. The minimal path from home to university will cross each separating road exactly once.\n\n But note: there might be roads that do not separate them (same side) and we don't need to cross. So the answer is simply the count of roads i for which the sign of (a_i*x1+b_i*y1+c_i) is different from the sign of (a_i*x2+b_i*y2+c_i).\n\n Let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: \"0 1 0\" -> equation: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n   Road2: \"1 0 0\" -> equation: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n\n   Check home (1,1) against y=0: 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 > 0.\n   Check university (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite -> must cross road1.\n\n   Check home (1,1) against x=0: 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 > 0.\n   Check university (-1,-1): 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite -> must cross road2.\n\n   So count = 2 -> output 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: x=0 -> same as above: home positive, university negative -> opposite.\n   Road2: y=0 -> same as above: home positive, university negative -> opposite.\n   Road3: \"1 1 -3\" -> equation: x+y-3=0.\n\n        For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n        For university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n\n   So same side for road3. Therefore, count = 2 -> output 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Steps = 0\n   For each road i (from 0 to n-1):\n        value_home = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n        value_uni = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\n        If (value_home * value_uni) < 0, then the signs are opposite, so we need to cross this road.\n\n   Then output the count.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is defined with negative signs? Note that the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple (since a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i=0 and k*(a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i)=0 represent the same line). But note: the sign of the expression depends on the representation.\n\n But the condition (value_home * value_uni) < 0 is invariant under scaling by a positive constant? Yes, because if we multiply by a positive k, then the product remains negative. But if we multiply by a negative constant, then the signs flip and the product becomes positive. However, note: the road equation is defined arbitrarily (ai,bi,ci can be negative or positive). \n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that the equation is normalized. However, the condition for the side of the line is defined by the sign of (a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i). But if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the sign flips. However, the separation condition (opposite sides) is symmetric: regardless of the sign normalization, if originally the two points were on opposite sides, after multiplying by -1 they will still be on opposite sides? Let's check:\n\n   Original: value_home = a*x1+b*y1+c, value_uni = a*x2+b*y2+c.\n   After multiplying by -1: value_home' = -a*x1-b*y1-c, value_uni' = -a*x2-b*y2-c.\n\n   Then value_home * value_uni < 0  <=> (-value_home') * (-value_uni') < 0  => value_home * value_uni < 0.\n\n   But wait: (-value_home') * (-value_uni') = value_home * value_uni. So the product is the same.\n\n   However, note: the product of the two new values is (value_home') * (value_uni') = (-a*x1-b*y1-c)*(-a*x2-b*y2-c) = (a*x1+b*y1+c)*(a*x2+b*y2+c) = value_home * value_uni.\n\n   So the condition (value_home * value_uni) < 0 is independent of the scaling (including negative scaling) because the product is the same.\n\n But wait: what if one of the expressions is zero? The problem states that neither home nor university lies on the road, so both value_home and value_uni are nonzero.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the product could be zero if one of them is zero, but the problem guarantees that they are not on the road.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n        v1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        v2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        # Since neither is zero, we can check the product\n        if v1 * v2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   Print count\n\n Let me run the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n    Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> v1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1, v2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product = -1 -> count+=1\n    Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> v1=1*1+0*1+0=1, v2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2\n\n Example 2: \n    Road1: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> same as above -> product=-1 -> count=1\n    Road2: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> same as above -> product=-1 -> count=2\n    Road3: a=1, b=1, c=-3 -> v1=1*1+1*1-3 = 2-3=-1, v2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3 = -2-3=-5 -> product=(-1)*(-5)=5 -> not negative -> count remains 2.\n\n So the answer for the second example is 2.\n\n However, wait: why is the second example's answer 2? The problem says the output is '2'. But let me think: the example input is:\n\n     1 1\n     -1 -1\n     3\n     1 0 0\n     0 1 0\n     1 1 -3\n\n But note: the third road is x+y-3=0. The home (1,1) is below the line (since 1+1=2 < 3) and the university (-1,-1) is also below (because -1+-1=-2<3). So they are on the same side. Therefore, we don't need to cross that road.\n\n However, the first two roads (x=0 and y=0) must be crossed. So the minimal steps is 2.\n\n But wait: what if we cross the two roads in any order? How many steps? Each crossing is one step, and we need to cross two roads. However, note that when you cross the first road (say x=0) you are now at (-1,1) [if we imagine crossing from (1,1) to (-1,1)] but wait: actually, crossing a road moves you to the other side. But the problem does not require to specify the path, just the number of steps.\n\n However, note: the movement is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one (via a common border). The blocks are separated by the lines. The minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university, because each step crosses one line.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are parallel? Then they are distinct and the separation condition is independent. The product condition still holds.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if the road equation has very large coefficients and the values v1 and v2 are very large? But we are only comparing the product, and the problem says that the coordinates and coefficients are integers in [-10^6, 10^6]. The maximum absolute value for v1 and v2 is |a|x1 + |b|y1 + |c|, and |a|,|b|,|c| up to 10^6, and x1,y1 up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value is 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. The product of two such numbers can be 4e24, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision) but we are only comparing if it is negative.\n\n However, we must avoid overflow in other languages? But the problem says the numbers are integers and we are using Python, so it's okay.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative, but the individual terms are huge? That's okay because we only care about the sign.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: if the product is negative, then one is positive and the other negative. But what if the product is positive? Then either both are positive or both are negative.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n        # Calculate the value for home and university\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # If the product is negative, then they are on opposite sides.\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: what if the two values are zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n But wait: there is an alternative example in the problem statement? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n Example 1: \n      Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n      Output: 2\n\n Example 2: \n      Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n      Output: 2\n\n But note: the problem says that the second example input is:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n However, wait: the example input format in the problem is two lines for coordinates, then n, then n lines for roads.\n\n But wait: the example input string in the problem is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n          ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        Output:\n          ['2', '2']\n\n So we are to read from stdin.\n\n Let me run the code with the first example:\n\n   Input: \n        \"1 1\"\n        \"-1 -1\"\n        \"2\"\n        \"0 1 0\"\n        \"1 0 0\"\n\n   Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n Second example:\n\n   Input:\n        \"1 1\"\n        \"-1 -1\"\n        \"3\"\n        \"1 0 0\"\n        \"0 1 0\"\n        \"1 1 -3\"\n\n   Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n But wait: is that really the minimal steps?\n\n Consider: the minimal steps is the number of separating lines. However, is it always the case that we can cross each separating line exactly once without having to cross a non-separating line? \n\n Actually, the problem says that you can move from one block to another if the common border is nonzero. This is equivalent to crossing one road (line). The entire journey requires crossing every separating line at least once, and we can arrange the path to cross each separating line exactly once (by going through the arrangement in an order that avoids unnecessary crossings). \n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of separating lines.\n\n However, wait: what if the home and university are separated by two lines, but the two lines are such that they form a barrier that requires crossing both, but there is a region that is adjacent to both? Then we might be able to cross one and then the other without having to cross the same line twice. But the minimal steps is still the number of separating lines.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to minimize the total distance, but the number of steps (each step is crossing one road). And the minimal number of roads to cross is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, consider a different scenario: \n\n   Suppose we have three lines: x=0, y=0, and x+y=0. \n   Let home be (1,1) and university be (-1,-1). \n   Then the separating lines are x=0, y=0, and for x+y=0: \n        (1,1): 1+1=2>0 -> positive, (-1,-1): -1-1=-2<0 -> negative -> so x+y=0 is separating.\n\n   Then we have 3 separating lines. But wait, let me plot:\n\n        The three lines: x=0, y=0, and x+y=0 (which is the line y=-x). These three lines divide the plane into 7 regions (or 6? Actually, 3 lines in general position divide the plane into 7 regions).\n\n        The home (1,1) is in the region where x>0, y>0, and x+y>0 (which is the same as x>0, y>0, because x+y>0 is automatically true when x>0 and y>0).\n        The university (-1,-1) is in the region x<0, y<0, and x+y<0.\n\n        To get from home to university, we must cross all three lines? \n\n        Actually, the minimal path must cross each of the three lines at least once. Why?\n\n        Consider: the home is in the region (x>0, y>0, x+y>0). The university is in (x<0, y<0, x+y<0). \n\n        To change from x>0 to x<0, we must cross x=0.\n        To change from y>0 to y<0, we must cross y=0.\n        To change from x+y>0 to x+y<0, we must cross x+y=0.\n\n        Therefore, we must cross each of the three lines. Hence, the minimal steps is 3.\n\n        However, what if we cross the lines in a different order? \n\n        Example: \n          Step1: cross x=0 -> now we are in (-, +, ?) \n          Now, at (-1,1): \n                x+y=0: -1+1=0 -> but wait, the point (-1,1) is on the line x+y=0? Actually, no: the equation is x+y=0, and -1+1=0, so the point (-1,1) is on the third road? \n\n        Wait, the problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", but during the travel we might step on a road? Actually, the problem says that the blocks are separated by the roads, and the movement is defined by nonzero common border. But note: the common border is the road itself, so when you cross a road, you are stepping on the road? \n\n        The problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is the road segment. So the movement happens along the road? Actually, the problem does not specify the exact path, but the condition is that the two blocks share a common border (a segment of a road). \n\n        However, note that the roads are infinite. When you cross a road, you are stepping on the road and then entering the adjacent block. But the problem does not say that you cannot step on the road. It just says that the common border must have nonzero length.\n\n        But wait: the example above: the point (-1,1) is on the third road (x+y=0). Then, when we cross the first road (x=0) from (1,1) to (-1,1), we are crossing the road x=0 at the point (0,1)? But (0,1) is not on the third road (because 0+1=1 !=0). \n\n        However, the minimal path may choose to cross the roads at points that are not intersections. But the key is: we are only counting the number of roads we cross.\n\n        Now, if we cross x=0 at (0,1) then we are not on the third road. Then we are in the block with x<0 and y>0. Then we must cross y=0 (to get to y<0) and then cross x+y=0 (to get to the university). \n\n        Alternatively, we can cross the three roads independently. \n\n        But note: the third road (x+y=0) separates the home and university. So we must cross it. However, we can cross it at any point. The minimal steps is still 3.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for that example would be 3.\n\n        Now, let me check with our method:\n\n            Road1: x=0 -> separating (home: 1>0, uni: -1<0) -> count=1.\n            Road2: y=0 -> separating (home: 1>0, uni: -1<0) -> count=2.\n            Road3: x+y=0 -> separating (home: 1+1=2>0, uni: -1-1=-2<0) -> count=3.\n\n        Output 3.\n\n        So the code would work.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that the common border must have nonzero length. What if two roads are the same? The problem states that no two roads are the same.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   Read the two points.\n   Read n.\n   For each of the n roads, read (a, b, c) and check if (a*x1+b*y1+c) * (a*x2+b*y2+c) < 0.\n\n   Then output the count.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative but due to integer overflow? The numbers are integers and the maximum absolute value is about 2e12, so the product is 4e24, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but the operations are efficient for numbers this size? Actually, 4e24 is a 80-bit number, which is manageable).\n\n However, we must note: the product might be negative even if the two values are negative? No: negative * negative is positive. Only when one is positive and the other negative, the product is negative.\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the two values are zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative way to check without multiplying (to avoid large numbers) by comparing the signs. But since the numbers are integers and the product is negative, we can also do:\n\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n\n   This avoids the multiplication and might be slightly faster and avoids the risk of overflow (even though in Python we are safe, but in other languages we might not be). However, the problem constraints are high, but the product is 4e24, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n But note: the product of two numbers that are around 2e12 can be 4e24, which is a very big integer, but Python handles it. However, if we are concerned about performance (n<=300, so 300 multiplications of numbers up to 4e24 is negligible), we can use either.\n\n Alternatively, we can compare the signs without the product. Since the product might be very large, but the signs are small, we can do:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n\n   This is equivalent and uses two comparisons (which is O(1)) and avoids the large product.\n\n Let me change the code to:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n\n This is the same condition: if one is negative and the other positive, then (val1<0) is True and (val2<0) is False, so True != False -> True.\n\n And if both are positive: (val1<0) is False, (val2<0) is False -> False == False -> condition fails.\n\n Similarly, both negative: (val1<0) is True, (val2<0) is True -> True==True -> condition fails.\n\n So it is equivalent.\n\n This avoids the multiplication and the potential (though negligible) risk of overflow in other languages.\n\n Therefore, I'll use the sign comparison.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check the signs\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example1: \n     Road1: a=0,b=1,c=0 -> val1 = 1, val2 = -1 -> (1<0) is False, (-1<0) is True -> False != True -> True -> count=1 for road1.\n     Road2: a=1,b=0,c=0 -> val1=1, val2=-1 -> same -> count=2.\n\n Example2: \n     Road1: same as above -> count=1.\n     Road2: same as above -> count=2.\n     Road3: a=1,b=1,c=-3 -> val1=1+1-3=-1, val2=-1-1-3=-5 -> both negative: (-1<0) is True, (-5<0) is True -> True==True -> condition fails.\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n We'll submit this.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? For example, the same road as x+y=0 can be written as -x-y=0. Then:\n\n        For home (1,1): -1-1+0 = -2 -> negative.\n        For university (-1,-1): -(-1)-(-1)+0 = 1+1=2 -> positive.\n\n        Then condition: (val1<0) is True, (val2<0) is False -> True != False -> condition holds.\n\n        But wait, the road equation: -x-y=0 is the same as x+y=0. And we already know that the home and university are on opposite sides. However, note:\n\n        The definition: the equation is a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i=0.\n\n        The side is determined by the sign of (a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i). For the equation -x-y=0, the side of (1,1) is negative and of (-1,-1) is positive.\n\n        So the condition is correctly identified.\n\n        But note: the equation -x-y=0 is the same as x+y=0, so the product condition would be:\n\n            Original: (1+1)(-1-1) = 2 * (-2) = -4 -> negative.\n\n        With the sign condition: \n            val1 = -1-1 = -2 -> negative\n            val2 = -(-1)-(-1) = 1+1=2 -> positive -> opposite.\n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road must be crossed if the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move from one block to the other.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, the road must be crossed once during the journey.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the home coordinates, followed by the university coordinates, then the number of roads \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), and \\(c_i\\) are extracted. The linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) is evaluated for both home and university coordinates.\n3. **Sign Comparison**: The signs of the evaluated expressions for home and university are compared. If they differ, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus, the road must be crossed once.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations, making it both optimal and easy to understand.",
