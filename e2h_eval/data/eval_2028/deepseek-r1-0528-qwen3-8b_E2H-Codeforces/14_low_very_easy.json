He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n We are to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n Observation:\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = (n//5) + (n//25) + (n//125) + ... \n\n Note: The function f(n) is non-decreasing as n increases.\n\n However, note that for a given m, we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the sample input m=1 gives output [5,6,7,8,9]. Why?\n   f(5) = 1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, then f(10)=2.\n\n So, for m=1, the numbers n from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". So we need to find the range of n for which f(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (let's call this lower_bound) and the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call this next_bound). Then the numbers n that satisfy f(n)=m are from lower_bound to next_bound - 1, but only if f(lower_bound) == m and f(next_bound-1)==m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is constant over an interval and then jumps at multiples of 5 (and powers of 5). So we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. (This is the first n where the number of trailing zeros becomes at least m)\n\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. (This is the first n where the number of trailing zeros becomes at least m+1)\n\n   Then, the numbers n with exactly m trailing zeros are from the first one (from step1) to the one just before step2.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n such that f(n)=m? For example, m=0: then we would look for n such that f(n)=0. \n   f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=0, f(3)=0, f(4)=0, f(5)=1. So for m=0, the answer is n from 0 to 4? However, note the problem says positive integers n. So n>=1. Then we consider n from 1 to 4.\n\n However, the problem states: \"positive integers n\", so n>=1. And the input m>=1. So we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n But note: the example input is given as ['1', '5'] and the output for m=5 is '0'. Actually, the example input format is a bit confusing. The example input is two examples: one input is '1' and the other is '5'. The expected outputs are two strings: for '1' -> \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\" and for '5' -> \"0\".\n\n However, note the example output for m=5 is \"0\", meaning there are no n such that f(n)=5? Actually, wait: let me check.\n\n Example: m=5\n\n   We need to find n such that f(n)=5.\n\n   Let's compute:\n     n=20: 20//5 = 4, 20//25=0 -> 4\n     n=21: same as 20 -> 4\n     n=24: 4\n     n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1 = 6.\n\n   So from n=20 to 24: 4 zeros, then n=25: 6 zeros. There is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n Therefore, the answer for m=5 is 0.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Let g(m) = the set of n (positive integers) such that f(n)=m.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. (We'll call this L)\n   2. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. (We'll call this R)\n\n   Then the numbers we want are from L to R-1, but we must check that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\). This sum counts the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find all \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we first find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) where it is at least \\( m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds, inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., the upper bound is not found), the answer is empty. For example, when \\( m = 5 \\), there is no \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly 5 trailing zeroes because the trailing zeroes jump from 4 (for \\( n = 24 \\)) to 6 (for \\( n = 25 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m + 1\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n            \n    L = lo\n    R = 0\n    hi2 = 5 * (m + 1) + 1\n    lo2 = 0\n    while lo2 < hi2:\n        mid2 = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid2) < m + 1:\n            lo2 = mid2 + 1\n        else:\n            hi2 = mid2\n    R = lo2\n    \n    if L >= R:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        numbers = list(range(L, R))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Finding Lower Bound (L)**: Using binary search, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). The search range is from 0 to \\( 5m + 1 \\), ensuring we cover all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Finding Upper Bound (R)**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m + 1 \\). The search range here is from 0 to \\( 5(m + 1) + 1 \\).\n\n4. **Result Determination**: If the lower bound \\( L \\) is greater than or equal to the upper bound \\( R \\), it means no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition, and the output is 0. Otherwise, all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) are printed, as they are the values of \\( n \\) for which \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function to quickly locate the required range of \\( n \\) values.",
