For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of 3 notes. We need to determine if they form a major or minor triad, or neither.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers in a semitone scale. Since the notes repeat every 12 semitones, we can assign each note a number (0 to 11) for the base octave.\n\n    Notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    Actually, wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    But note: traditionally, B and H might be considered differently? However, the problem states: \n        \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n    And then: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\n    So, let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11\n\n    However, note that the example input includes \"C# B F\" and \"A B H\".\n\n    But wait: the example says \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map:\n\n        C#: 1\n        B: 10\n        F: 5\n\n    Now, we have to consider the circular nature (so modulo 12). The distances are computed by taking the minimum steps in the circle (but note: the problem says distance from lowest to highest, but in the example they consider the chord as an unordered set and then order the notes so that the distances are defined in the given way.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n    This ordering must be such that the entire set of three notes is covered and the distances are measured in the forward direction (without wrapping around more than necessary?).\n\n    But note: the example says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (which is going from E to F to F# to G to G# to A to B to C: that's 8 semitones). However, when we order the chord, we are allowed to arrange the three notes in any cyclic order? Actually, the problem says \"unordered set\", so we can rearrange arbitrarily.\n\n    Approach:\n\n    We have three notes. We can represent each note by its semitone value (from 0 to 11). Then we can compute the differences between consecutive notes (in a circular way) but we have to consider all cyclic orders.\n\n    However, note: the definition says that the chord has three notes. We are to check two conditions:\n\n    Condition for major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        (Y - X) % 12 = 4   [but actually, since we are on a circle, we might need to consider the smallest positive distance? However, the example does not wrap: C to E is 4, E to G is 3, and then the total from C to G is 7. But if we have a chord that wraps, for example, notes: G, A, C -> which is G(7), A(9), C(0). Then from A to C: 0-9 is negative, so we take (0 - 9 + 12) % 12 = 3? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, we can break the circle and consider the three points and then look at the three gaps.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let the three notes be a, b, c (each from 0 to 11). We can generate all permutations (since the set is small, 3! = 6) and check for each permutation if the condition holds.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". The distance from X to Y is the forward distance (without wrapping backwards). However, the example also says that the distance from E to C is 8, meaning that we don't wrap backwards, but in the chord ordering we are only concerned with the consecutive steps in the ordered set.\n\n    How to define the distance? The problem says: \"the distance is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves analyzing the intervals between the notes in all possible cyclic orders to check if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note into a numerical value based on its position in the 12-note chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation of the three notes, compute the intervals between consecutive notes (considering the circular nature of the musical scale). The distance between two notes is calculated as the smallest positive difference modulo 12.\n3. **Triad Check**: A chord is classified as:\n   - **Major** if there exists an ordering where the first interval is 4 semitones and the second is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor** if there exists an ordering where the first interval is 3 semitones and the second is 4 semitones.\n   - **Strange** if neither condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6, \n        'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11,\n        'En': 4, 'Fn': 5, 'Bb': 10, 'Ab': 9, 'D#/Eb': 3, 'F#/Gb': 6, 'G#/Ab': 8, 'A#/Bb': 11\n    }\n    nums = []\n    for note in notes:\n        if note == 'En':\n            nums.append(mapping['E'])\n        elif note == 'Fn':\n            nums.append(mapping['F'])\n        elif note == 'Bb':\n            nums.append(mapping['B'])\n        elif note == 'Ab':\n            nums.append(mapping['A'])\n        elif note == 'D#/Eb':\n            nums.append(mapping['D#'])\n        elif note == 'F#/Gb':\n            nums.append(mapping['F#'])\n        elif note == 'G#/Ab':\n            nums.append(mapping['G#'])\n        elif note == 'A#/Bb':\n            nums.append(mapping['A#'])\n        else:\n            parts = note.split()\n            if len(parts) == 1:\n                nums.append(mapping[parts[0]])\n            else:\n                base = parts[0]\n                acc = parts[1][0] if len(parts[1]) > 0 else ''\n                if base == 'D' and acc == '#':\n                    nums.append(mapping['D#'])\n                elif base == 'D' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['D'])\n                elif base == 'F' and acc == '#':\n                    nums.append(mapping['F#'])\n                elif base == 'F' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['F'])\n                elif base == 'G' and acc == '#':\n                    nums.append(mapping['G#'])\n                elif base == 'G' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['G'])\n                elif base == 'A' and acc == '#':\n                    nums.append(mapping['A#'])\n                elif base == 'A' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['A'])\n                elif base == 'C' and acc == '#':\n                    nums.append(mapping['C#'])\n                elif base == 'C' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['C'])\n                elif base == 'E' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['E'])\n                elif base == 'B' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['B'])\n                elif base == 'H' and acc == '':\n                    nums.append(mapping['H'])\n                else:\n                    nums.append(mapping[base])\n    \n    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n    while len(unique_nums) < 3:\n        num_copy = unique_nums.copy()\n        unique_nums = []\n        for n in num_copy:\n            unique_nums.append((n + 12) % 12)\n        unique_nums.sort()\n        for i in range(len(unique_nums)-1):\n            if unique_nums[i+1] - unique_nums[i] == 0:\n                break\n        else:\n            break\n\n    if len(unique_nums) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n\n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n\n    for perm in permutations(unique_nums):\n        p = list(perm)\n        d1 = (p[1] - p[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (p[2] - p[1]) % 12\n        d3 = (p[0] - p[2]) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 5:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 5:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by reading the input notes and converting them into numerical values using a predefined dictionary. Special cases like 'En' (E natural), 'Fn' (F natural), etc., are handled separately to ensure correct mapping.\n2. **Handling Duplicate Notes**: If any duplicate notes are detected, the code adjusts their values by adding 12 to simulate different octaves, ensuring all three notes are distinct.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. For a major triad, the intervals should be 4 and 3 semitones. For a minor triad, the intervals should be 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if none of the conditions are met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the notes to classify the chord type accurately.",
