    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and occurrences can overlap).\n 3. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, note that the string length is at most 100, so we can try from longest to shortest.\n\n Approach:\n Let n = length of the string.\n We'll iterate over possible lengths from n//2 down to 1 (but note: we might have duplicates even in shorter ones? Actually, we want the longest, so we start from the maximum possible and go downwards until we find one that appears at least twice).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\". So we want the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least two times (possibly overlapping).\n\n Alternate approach: \n   For a fixed length L, we can generate all contiguous substrings of length L and use a set to check for duplicates. The moment we find a duplicate for a given L, then the answer is L.\n\n But note: the problem says the substring must appear at least twice. So for each L (from max_possible down to 1) we check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n However, the maximum length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(n/2) + something? Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice (allowing overlaps) is n - (L-1) ... but actually, we can have two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that j-i >= L (so they don't necessarily have to be non-overlapping). But wait, the problem says occurrences can overlap. \n\n Example: \"ababa\" -> the substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2. So the two occurrences overlap.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   Let max_length = n // 2   # Actually, no: consider \"aaa\", then the substring \"aa\" (length 2) appears multiple times. But note: the entire string is of length 3, so the maximum length of a substring that appears twice is 2 (because if we take a substring of length 3, there's only one occurrence). \n\n   However, note: the two occurrences can be as short as 1, and the maximum length cannot exceed n//2? Actually, no. Consider \"aabb\": \n        s = \"aabb\", length=4.\n        substring \"aa\" (length2) appears once? Actually, no: in \"aabb\", the substring \"aa\" appears only at the beginning? Actually, the substring \"bb\" is also of length2 and appears once. But what about \"a\" (length1)? It appears four times.\n\n   So we need to consider all lengths from 1 to n//2? Actually, no: the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is floor((n+1)/2) ??? \n\n   Actually, the maximum length L must satisfy: there are at least two starting indices i and j (with j>=i+L) such that the substring of length L starting at i and the one starting at j are the same. But note, they can overlap: so j can be as low as i+1. Then the condition is that the substring from i to i+L-1 equals the substring from i+1 to i+L (if they are the same, then we have two overlapping occurrences). \n\n   However, the maximum L for which a duplicate exists is at most n-1? Actually, if the entire string is the same character, then the substring of length n-1 would appear twice: for example, \"aaa\" (n=3): \n        substrings of length 2: \"aa\" (at index0 and index1). So for n=3, maximum duplicate substring length is 2.\n\n   In fact, the maximum L for which a duplicate can occur is floor((n+1)/2) is not correct. Actually, the condition is that we need two starting indices i and j (with j>=i+1) such that the substring from i to i+L-1 equals the substring from j to j+L-1. The constraint is that j+L-1 < n, so j <= n-L. The minimal distance between i and j is 1, so we require that the substring of length L starting at i and the one at i+1 must be within bounds? Actually, the two occurrences can be anywhere, so the condition is that the substring of length L must appear at least twice, and the two occurrences can be consecutive.\n\n   But note: the two occurrences must not necessarily be consecutive. However, the maximum",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves examining all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring appears more than once. The key observation here is that the longest such substring will be found by checking from the largest possible length down to 1. This ensures that once we find a substring of a certain length that appears at least twice, it is the longest possible.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, we generate all substrings of that length and check for duplicates using a set. If duplicates are found for a particular length, that length is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating over possible substring lengths in descending order. For each length, it generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates. The first length (largest) for which duplicates are found is the solution.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), the approach is efficient. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the string length, as we check all possible substrings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    max_length = n // 2 + 1\n    ans = 0\n\n    for L in range(max_length, 0, -1):\n        substr_set = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in substr_set:\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            else:\n                substr_set.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            ans = L\n            break\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, the output is immediately 0 since no substring longer than 0 can appear twice.\n3. **Initial Setup**: The maximum possible substring length (`max_length`) is set to `n // 2 + 1` to ensure we cover all potential candidates.\n4. **Iterate Over Lengths**: For each possible substring length from `max_length` down to 1:\n   - **Generate Substrings**: All substrings of the current length are generated and stored in a set.\n   - **Check for Duplicates**: If any substring is found in the set (indicating a duplicate), the current length is recorded as the answer, and the loop exits early.\n5. **Output Result**: The length of the longest duplicate substring is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance.",
