Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the three lines from stdin.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (the guest's name and the host's name) to form the target string.\n 2. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 3. If they are the same, then we can form the names from the pile (so output \"YES\"), otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should have exactly the letters needed for both names (no extra, no missing).\n So, we need to check that the multiset of letters in the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined two names.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip any newline characters) to get the expected letters.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the expected string and in the pile string.\n\n Alternatively, we can sort both strings and then compare.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Expected: \n        Combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, let's count the letters:\n\n   Actually, note: the example input is given as a string with newlines, so we need to split the input.\n\n Let me clarify with the example provided in the note:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\\n\"\n      Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\\n\"\n      Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   The combined expected letters are \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, let's break down:\n\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> has letters: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> but wait, we don't need to break it, just combine.\n\n   Combined expected: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's sort both:\n\n   Expected sorted: sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n   Pile sorted: sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n   But wait, let's compare the counts:\n\n   Expected: \n        S: 2, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n   Pile:\n        S: 2, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, L: 1, C: 1, U: 1\n\n   Actually, the counts are the same.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\", so we must match.\n\n   However, in the example input provided in the problem, the third line is the pile.\n\n   But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a list of strings, but in the problem, we read from stdin.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n   Then, combined = s1 + s2\n   pile = s3\n\n   Then, if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: NO\n\n        Combined = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Sort combined: \n            'A': 2, 'E': 1, 'I': 2, 'J': 1, 'L': 1, 'N': 1, 'O': 2, 'P': 2, 'U': 2, 'K': 2\n\n        Wait, let me count:\n\n        Combined: \n            PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\n            P: 2, A: 2, I:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters required to form both names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string representing all required letters.\n3. **Check Letter Counts**: Compare the sorted list of letters from the combined names with the sorted list of letters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the required letters, and the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for exact matches in letter counts by leveraging sorting, which ensures that the order of letters does not matter, only their frequencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string `combined`, which represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The letters in `combined` and the pile are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions of both strings match, it means the pile contains exactly the required letters in the correct quantities, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently checks for the exact match of letter counts between the combined names and the pile, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
