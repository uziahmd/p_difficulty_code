Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c for ax+by+c=0).\n The key observation: \n We are allowed to cross one road at a time, but only if we step from one block to another that shares a common border (which is part of the road). \n However, note that we are not allowed to step from two blocks that are adjacent only at an intersection (without a nonzero segment) in one step. \n\n But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that crossing a single road is allowed because the entire line (except possibly isolated points) is the common border.\n\n However, the catch is that we are only allowed to change one road at a time? Actually, we are moving from one block to another by crossing a road. Each crossing of a road is one step.\n\n But wait: what if two roads cross at a point? Then two blocks might be separated by two roads, but we cannot cross both at the same time. We have to cross each road separately.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n In fact, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of roads that separate home from university. However, note that if we cross a road, we change the side of that road. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points, but wait: sometimes you can cross multiple roads at once if they all meet at an intersection? But the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So we are crossing one road at a time.\n\n However, consider: if two roads intersect, then there is a point where they cross. But when we cross one road, we are moving from one side to the other. To get from home to university, we must cross every road that separates them? Not exactly: because if two roads are such that home is on one side and university on the other for both, then we must cross both. But note: we can cross them at different times, and the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note that the plane is divided by n lines. The regions are defined by these lines. The minimal steps is the minimal number of lines we have to cross to go from home to university. And that is exactly the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: how do we determine which lines separate the two points?\n For a given line: ax+by+c=0, we can define a half-plane for the side of the line. We can use the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) for a point (x,y).\n\n For home (x1,y1): compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n For university (x2,y2): compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n If s1 and s2 have opposite signs, then the two points lie on opposite sides of the line. Therefore, we must cross this line an odd number of times (at least once) to get from home to university.\n\n Now, is the minimal number of steps the total number of such lines? \n\n Let's think: we start at home and end at university. We must cross every line that separates them. But note: we can cross a set of lines arbitrarily, and the order doesn't matter in terms of the minimal steps? Actually, we can cross the lines independently. However, we cannot avoid crossing every separating line.\n\n But here's a catch: what if we cross two lines that are parallel? Then we don't meet at an intersection. But still, we cross one at a time.\n\n However, consider that we are only concerned with the minimal steps. Each step crosses one line (and only one line). So the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: what if two lines separate the two points and they are not crossed consecutively? Actually, no: the minimal steps is the number of separating lines. Because to get from home to university, you must cross every separating line, and you can do one per step.\n\n However, note: sometimes the same separating line might be encountered twice? But no, because we are going from home to university and the separation is fixed. The minimal steps is the number of lines for which home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   The first two lines are the vertical and horizontal lines through origin.\n\n   Home (1,1): \n        Line1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y = 0. Value = 1 -> positive.\n        Line2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x = 0. Value = 1 -> positive.\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n        Line1: y = -1 -> value = -1 -> negative.\n        Line2: x = -1 -> value = -1 -> negative.\n\n   Both lines separate the two points. Therefore, answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   The first two lines are the same as above. The third line is x+y-3=0.\n\n   Check the third line for (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n            for (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n\n   So only two lines separate the two points. Answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   count = 0\n   for each road (a, b, c):\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:   # opposite signs\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the two points are on the same side of a line? Then we don't need to cross it.\n\n However, consider: what if the two points are in the same half-plane for a line, but the line might still be crossed if we take a path that goes over the line? But note: we want the minimal steps. We are allowed to choose any path. The minimal path would avoid crossing non-separating lines. Therefore, we only need to cross the lines that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to cross every separating line necessarily? Actually, yes: if a line separates the two points, then any path from home to university must cross that line an odd number of times. Since we are minimizing steps (each step crosses one line) we must cross each separating line at least once, and we can arrange the crossings so that we cross each separating line exactly once. \n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by multiple lines? Then the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\n However, let me test with two lines that are the same? But the input guarantees no two roads are the same.\n\n Another example: three lines forming a triangle. Suppose home is inside the triangle and university is outside. Then we must cross one or more lines. Actually, the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say we have to cross the lines in a straight line. We can take a detour. But the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\n But wait: what if two separating lines are crossed at the same point? Then we can cross two lines at the same step? \n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n When two lines cross, the adjacent blocks are separated by two lines. However, the common border between two blocks is a segment of one of the lines (unless the two blocks share a common segment that is part of two lines, which is impossible). Actually, the common border between two blocks is always a segment of one road. \n\n Therefore, in one step we can only cross one road. Hence, we must count each separating road individually.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, there is a caveat: what if the two points are separated by a line, but the minimal path crosses that line twice? That would not be minimal. But the minimal path crosses each separating line exactly once.\n\n So the program is straightforward.\n\n But wait: what about the case when the two points are already in the same block? Then no line separates them, so count=0.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        2 2\n        1\n        0 1 0\n\n   Here, the line is y=0. Home (1,1) is above, university (2,2) is also above. Then no step.\n\n However, what if we have two lines, but the two points are in the same region? Then we don't cross any.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0: \n            count += 1\n\n   Print count\n\n But wait: what if the product s1*s2 is zero? According to the problem, neither home nor university lies on the road. So s1 and s2 are never zero. Therefore, we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n However, note: the product might be very large (since coordinates and coefficients can be up to 10**6). But the product of two numbers each up to 10**6 * (10**6 + 10**6 + ...) actually:\n\n   s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and each term: a, x1, etc. can be up to 10**6 in absolute value. So the maximum absolute value for s1 is 10**6 * (|10**6| + |10**6| + |10**6|) = 3 * 10**12, which is within the range of Python integers (since we are only comparing sign, we don't need exact value, but we need to check if the product is negative). However, we are using multiplication of two such numbers: the product can be as large as (3e12)^2 = 9e24, which is acceptable in Python (since Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are just doing a sign check). However, if we are concerned about overflow in other languages, but here we are in Python.\n\n But note: there is an alternative: instead of checking s1*s2 < 0, we can check the signs separately. But the problem says the points are not on the road, so we know s1 and s2 are nonzero. Then:\n\n   if (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) or (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0):\n\n This avoids the large product.\n\n However, the product might be negative even if we are dealing with very large numbers, but the product is negative if the two have opposite signs. But note: the product might be too large for some systems? But in Python, we can handle that.\n\n But for safety and clarity, we can use the comparison without product.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n\n This is equivalent and avoids the product.\n\n Let me write:\n\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n This is safe.\n\n However, note: the equation of the line is ax+by+c=0. The sign of the expression determines the side. But the side is defined arbitrarily by the line. The condition for opposite sides is indeed that the two expressions have opposite signs.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n        s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let's run the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: [0,1,0] -> s1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive, s2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> opposite -> count becomes 1.\n   Road2: [1,0,0] -> s1 = 1*1+0*1+0=1 -> positive, s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> negative -> opposite -> count becomes 2.\n\n Example 2: \n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: [1,0,0] -> opposite, count=1.\n   Road2: [0,1,0] -> opposite, count=2.\n   Road3: [1,1,-3] -> s1=1+1-3=-1, s2=-1-1-3=-5 -> both negative -> same side -> no count.\n\n So output 2.\n\n It matches.\n\n But wait, what if the line equation is given with negative leading coefficient? For example, if we have a line -x - y + 3 = 0, then the equation is the same as x+y-3=0. So we are effectively considering the same line. The sign of the expression is reversed, but the side definition is consistent: if we consider the line x+y-3=0, then above the line (say (0,0)) gives -3, and below (say (0,4)) gives 1. But if we use -x-y+3=0, then (0,0) gives 3, and (0,4) gives -1. So the side definitions are swapped. However, the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) still holds because the two expressions for the same line have the same sign pattern relative to the two points? \n\n Actually, if we have two representations of the same line, the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) will be the same. Why?\n\n Let L1: ax+by+c=0 and L2: k*(ax+by+c)=0 (with k≠0). Then the sign of (ax+by+c) is the same as the sign of (k*(ax+by+c)) if k>0, and opposite if k<0. \n\n But note: the problem states that the roads are defined by the equation aix+biy+ci=0, and they are not the same. However, two different representations (like multiplied by a constant) would be considered the same road? The problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so we don't have two identical equations. But we might have two equations that represent the same line (if one is a scalar multiple of the other) but the problem says \"guaranteed that no two roads are the same\", so they are distinct equations even if they represent the same line? \n\n Actually, no: two distinct equations can represent the same line. But the problem says: \"the following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ... defining the i-th road\". It doesn't say they are normalized. \n\n However, the condition for being the same line is that one equation is a nonzero multiple of the other. The problem says \"no two roads are the same\", meaning they are distinct as equations. But if we have two equations that are multiples, then they are the same line. \n\n But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" So we don't have two identical lines.\n\n However, the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) is independent of the representation? \n\n Let me check: \n   Consider two representations: \n        L1: ax+by+c=0\n        L2: k*a*x+k*b*y+k*c=0 (with k≠0)\n\n   Then for a point (x,y): \n        s1 (for L1) = ax+by+c\n        s2 (for L2) = k*(ax+by+c)\n\n   Then (s1 < 0) is the same as (s2 < 0) if k>0, and opposite if k<0.\n\n   Therefore, if we have two representations of the same line (but with different k) then the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) might give a different result for the same two points.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so we are guaranteed that the equations are distinct. But they might still represent the same line. \n\n However, the problem says \"each road is defined by the equation\", and the equation is given by (ai, bi, ci). Two equations define the same line if (a1,b1,c1) is a nonzero multiple of (a2,b2,c2). \n\n How to avoid this issue? Actually, we are told that the roads are distinct. But if two equations represent the same line, then the condition for the two points being on the same side or opposite sides is independent of the representation? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   The set of points satisfying ax+by+c=0 is the same as the set of points satisfying k*a*x+k*b*y+k*c=0. Therefore, the side (half-plane) defined by the inequality ax+by+c > 0 is the same as the side defined by k*a*x+k*b*y+k*c > 0 if k>0, and opposite if k<0.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which side is which. However, the minimal steps is defined by the separating lines: if the two points are separated by the line, then regardless of the representation we must cross the line. But the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) must hold for the two points to be separated by the line.\n\n However, if the representation changes the sign, then the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) is the same as (s2<0) != (t1<0) for the same line represented differently? \n\n Actually, if we have two representations of the same line, then the sign of the expression for a given point is the same if the scaling factor is positive, and opposite if negative. \n\n But the problem does not guarantee that the equations are normalized. Therefore, we must account for the possibility of different scaling factors.\n\n However, note: the condition for being separated by the line is independent of the representation: two points are separated by the line if and only if one is on one side and the other on the other. This is independent of how we write the equation.\n\n But our method using (s1<0) != (s2<0) is not independent of the representation if the representation has a negative scaling factor.\n\n Example: \n   Consider a line: x+y-3=0.\n   Representation1: [1,1,-3] -> for (1,1): 1+1-3=-1 (negative), for (0,0): -3 (negative) -> same side.\n   Representation2: [-1,-1,3] -> for (1,1): -1-1+3=1 (positive), for (0,0): 3 (positive) -> same side.\n\n   Now, consider two points: (1,1) and (0,4)\n   Representation1: \n        (1,1): -1 (negative)\n        (0,4): 0+4-3=1 (positive) -> opposite -> count as separating.\n   Representation2:\n        (1,1): 1 (positive)\n        (0,4): -1 (negative) -> opposite -> count as separating.\n\n   Now, consider two points: (1,1) and (2,2) for the same line (using representation1: [1,1,-3])\n        (1,1): -1 (negative)\n        (2,2): 1+2-3=0 -> wait, but (2,2) is on the line? The problem says the points are not on the road. So we don't have to worry.\n\n   But what if we have two representations of the same line, and the two points are separated by the line? Then both representations will yield opposite signs for the two points.\n\n   Why? Because if we multiply by a positive constant, the signs remain the same. If we multiply by a negative constant, the signs flip. But then the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) is still true because both signs flip. \n\n   Example: \n        Original: [1,1,-3] -> s1 = 1*x1+y1-3, s2=1*x2+y2-3.\n        Negative: [-1,-1,3] -> t1 = -x1-y1+3 = -(x1+y1-3) = -s1, t2 = -x2-y2+3 = -s2.\n\n        Then (s1<0) != (s2<0)  <=>  (t1<0) != (t2<0) because:\n            If s1 and s2 had opposite signs, then -s1 and -s2 also have opposite signs.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is invariant under scaling by a positive constant, and also by a negative constant (because the opposite signs condition is preserved). \n\n   Hence, the method is robust.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a representation that is a mix of positive and negative? Actually, the condition (s1<0) != (s2<0) is equivalent to the two points being on opposite sides of the line, regardless of the representation.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n Let me code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are distinct. But distinct equations might represent the same line (if one is a negative multiple of the other). But we just saw that the condition is invariant under negative multiples. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the equation is given with a negative leading term and then a positive, etc.?

The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\".

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation is that each road must be crossed exactly once if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The solution hinges on determining for each road whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of it.\n2. **Insight**: For each road, compute the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and thus, one step is needed to cross this road.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each road, compute the sign of the linear expression for both points, and count the number of roads where the signs differ. This count directly gives the minimal steps required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The expressions \\(a*x + b*y + c\\) are evaluated for both home and university coordinates.\n3. **Sign Check**: If the signs of the evaluated expressions for the two points differ, the road separates them, and the step count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to move from home to university without crossing any road more than once.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem constraints.",
