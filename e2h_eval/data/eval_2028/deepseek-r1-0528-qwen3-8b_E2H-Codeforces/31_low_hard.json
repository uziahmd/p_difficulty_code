Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards).\n We can use as many additional cards as we want, each with an integer between -x and x.\n\n Goal: Find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards whose total sum is -S.\n\n 3. Each additional card can have any integer in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x.\n\n 4. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum number k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each between -x and x) such that a1 + a2 + ... + ak = -S?\n\n 5. Note: We are allowed to choose any integers in the range, so the only constraints are:\n    - The absolute value of each integer <= x.\n    - The sum must be exactly -S.\n\n 6. Consider:\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any additional card -> answer 0.\n\n 7. Otherwise, we are looking for the smallest k (a positive integer) such that:\n    a) The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k * x (if we use all x's).\n    b) The minimum negative sum is -k * x.\n    c) So we require that -S must be in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n    However, note: we might not need to use the entire range if k is chosen appropriately.\n\n 8. But wait: there's more nuance because we can also use zeros and negative/positive numbers arbitrarily.\n\n    Actually, we can rephrase: we need to find the smallest k such that:\n        -k*x <= -S <= k*x\n\n    However, note: the equation is: we need to form -S. This is equivalent to:\n        | -S | <= k * x   =>   |S| <= k * x.\n\n    So the condition is that the absolute value of S must be at most k*x.\n\n 9. But is that sufficient? Not exactly. Because we can only use integers, but since we can use any integer from -x to x, we can adjust by one unit per card (actually, we can change the total by up to x per card). However, note that the set of achievable sums with k cards is every integer between -k*x and k*x that has the same parity as k*x (if we consider the entire set without restrictions)? Actually, no: we can use any integer from -x to x, so the step is 1.\n\n    Actually, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of all integers T such that:\n        -k*x <= T <= k*x.\n\n    Why? Because we can choose each card independently. For example, with k=1: T can be any integer from -x to x. With k=2: T can be any integer from -2x to 2x (because we can choose two numbers and their sum can take every integer value in that range? Not necessarily: if x is even, then we can form every integer? Actually, no: with two cards, if x=1, then we can form from -2 to 2, but only even numbers? Wait, no: with two cards and x=1, we can form:\n        (-1,-1): -2\n        (-1,0): -1\n        (-1,1): 0\n        (0,0): 0\n        (0,1): 1\n        (1,1): 2\n        But wait, we can also have duplicates? Actually, the set of available numbers is fixed: from -x to x. So with two cards and x=1, we have the numbers {-1,0,1}. Then the sums are:\n            -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2 -> so we get all integers from -2 to 2.\n\n    Similarly, with k=3 and x=1: we can get every integer from -3 to 3.\n\n    In fact, because we can use zeros and the numbers are consecutive, the set of achievable sums with k cards and numbers in [-x, x] is every integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n    Why? We can use the following greedy idea: we want to form a target T (which is -S) with k cards, and |T| <= k*x.\n\n    We can use the following: we can use one card to adjust by any amount between -x and x. But actually, we can think of it as:\n\n        Let d = T (which is -S). We",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves analyzing the current sum of the found cards and calculating the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum to zero using cards with values between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vanya has found `n` cards, each with an integer value. The goal is to make the sum of these cards zero by adding the fewest possible cards, each with a value between -x and x (inclusive).\n   - The key observation is that the sum of the additional cards must be exactly `-S`, where `S` is the sum of the found cards.\n   - The minimal number of additional cards required depends on whether the absolute value of `S` can be covered by the sum of `k` cards, each contributing at most `x` in absolute value. Specifically, the condition is that `|S| <= k * x`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - If the sum `S` of the found cards is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, iterate over possible values of `k` (starting from 1 upwards) until the condition `|S| <= k * x` is satisfied. The smallest such `k` is the answer.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The algorithm checks each `k` starting from 1 until the condition is met. In the worst case, `k` could be as large as `|S|/x + 1`, which is linear in the magnitude of `S`. Given the constraints (n and x up to 1000), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = 1\n    while abs(total) > k * x:\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x` for any card, and the list of card values.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum `total` of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately `0` since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Finding Minimum k**: For non-zero sums, the algorithm increments `k` starting from 1 until the absolute value of the sum is less than or equal to `k * x`. This ensures that the required sum can be achieved with `k` cards, each contributing at most `x` in absolute value.\n- **Output Result**: The smallest `k` satisfying the condition is printed, representing the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the constraint that each additional card can adjust the sum by a limited amount, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
