    "thought": "\n We are given an array of n distinct integers (n between 1 and 22). We need to output a permutation b of a such that for every non-empty proper subset S of indices, the sum of elements in a at indices in S is different from the sum of elements in b at indices in S.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array has distinct integers and n is at most 22, we can consider the following:\n\n Let the original array be a[0..n-1]. We are going to create a permutation b.\n\n Note: The condition must hold for every non-empty proper subset S. This means that the set of all subset-sums (from the original array a) and the set of all subset-sums (from the permuted array b) must not share any common value, except possibly the empty set? But note: the problem excludes the empty subset and the full set. However, note that the full set is also excluded. But wait: the condition says \"for every non-empty subset S (with 0 < k < n)\".\n\n Actually, note: the problem says \"non-empty subset\" but then specifies \"0 < k < n\", so the full set (k = n) is excluded. Also, the empty set is excluded.\n\n However, note: the condition must hold for every non-empty proper subset. So we have two sets of numbers:\n\n   A = { sum_{i in T} a[i] for every non-empty T ⊂ {0,1,...,n-1} }   (excluding T being the entire set? No, wait: the condition applies only to subsets with k from 1 to n-1. So T cannot be the entire set, but note: the entire set is excluded, but what about other subsets? \n\n But note: the condition must hold for every non-empty subset that is not the entire set. However, the entire set is excluded, so we don't require the entire set's sum to be different from the entire set's sum in b? Actually, the condition is: the sums of elements on that positions (in a and in b) must be different. So for a given subset S (which is non-empty and not the entire set), we require:\n      sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]\n\n However, note: the entire set is excluded, so we don't compare the entire set. But note: the entire set is one particular set. The condition does not require that the entire set's sum in a equals the entire set's sum in b? Actually, the condition only applies to proper non-empty subsets. So if by chance the entire set's sum is the same, that is allowed because the condition doesn't cover it.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"for every non-empty subset S (with 0<k<n)\" so indeed the entire set is not included.\n\n However, there is a catch: the subset-sums we are comparing are for the same set of indices. The array b is a permutation, so the multiset of b is the same as a.\n\n How to approach?\n\n One idea: if we can find a permutation b such that the set of all proper non-empty subset sums for a and the set for b are disjoint, then we are done.\n\n However, note that the total number of subset sums for a is 2^n - 1 (if we exclude empty) but we are excluding the full set as well, so actually 2^n - 2. But the values can be very large (up to 10^9 * 22) and n up to 22, so the total subset sums might be huge, but note: we are only concerned with the proper non-empty ones.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem is similar to the concept of \"derangement\" but for subset sums.\n\n Another observation: consider the entire set of indices. The entire set is excluded from the condition, but note that the entire set's sum in a and the entire set's sum in b are the same (since b is a permutation). However, that is acceptable because the condition does not apply to the entire set.\n\n But what about the subsets? We must ensure that no proper non-empty subset has the same sum in a and in b.\n\n However, note that the entire set is fixed (same multiset) so the total sum is the same. But the condition does not require that the entire set's sum is different from itself? It doesn't matter because the entire set is excluded.\n\n But note: the condition applies to every non-empty subset that is not the entire set. So we have to worry about the proper subsets.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Since n is small (<=22) but the numbers can be up to 10^9, we cannot iterate over all permutations (n! which is too many).\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Consider that the condition must hold for every subset. In particular, the smallest non-empty subset is single",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices, the sum of the elements at those positions in the original array and the permuted array are different. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that if the smallest element in the array is significantly larger than the sum of all other elements combined, then any permutation of the array will trivially satisfy the condition. This is because the smallest element alone will have a sum larger than any subset sum of the remaining elements. \n\n2. **Intuition**: For example, consider an array where the smallest element is greater than the sum of all other elements. In this case, the smallest element's sum (when taken alone) will be larger than any other subset sum (since other subsets either include the smallest element or do not). Thus, the condition is automatically satisfied.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking if the smallest element in the array is greater than the sum of all other elements. If this condition holds, we can simply return the array sorted in ascending order. If not, the problem might have no solution, and we should return -1. However, given the constraints (n ≤ 22), this approach efficiently checks the feasibility without exhaustive permutation checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    min_val = min(a)\n    other_sum = sum(a) - min_val\n    \n    if min_val > other_sum:\n        b = sorted(a)\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, b)))\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the size of the array `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array size `n` is 1, it's impossible to have a non-empty proper subset, so the answer is -1.\n3. **Condition Check**: The smallest element in the array is compared to the sum of all other elements. If the smallest element is greater than this sum, sorting the array in ascending order ensures that any subset sum involving the smallest element will be larger than any subset sum not including it, thus satisfying the problem's conditions.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the condition check, the solution either prints the sorted array or -1, indicating no valid permutation exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the problem's constraints and mathematical insight to provide a solution without exhaustive permutation checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
