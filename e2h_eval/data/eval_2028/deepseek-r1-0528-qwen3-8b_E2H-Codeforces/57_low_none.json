His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour points (a) and the second tour points (b).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that ai + bj >= x\", meaning there is at least one participant (and possibly Vasya) who has total at least x.\n\n However, note that the problem does not tell us which pair (i, j) is Vasya's. But we can assume that Vasya's score is one of the pairs (ai, bj) for some i and j? Actually, the input gives two lists: the first list a1...an for the first tour and the second list b1...bn for the second tour. The participants are identified by their two scores.\n\n Important: The problem says the results have only points, no names. So we have two arrays of n numbers, but we don't know which participant's first tour score goes with which second tour score.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, so the two lists are independent. The catch: we don't know which participant is which.\n\n But here's the twist: we are allowed to assign any pairing? Actually, no: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\". So the two lists are the same set of participants? Actually, no: the two lists are of the same n participants, but the order is arbitrary.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so each participant has one score in the first tour and one score in the second tour.\n\n But wait: the input gives two separate lists of n integers. This implies that the two lists are two different orders of the same participants? Actually, no: the problem does not specify that the same index corresponds to the same participant. \n\n Clarification: The problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", and there are n participants. So we have two sets of n scores, but we don't know which participant got which score in which tour.\n\n However, note: the problem also says that Vasya was present, and we know that his two scores (from the two lists) must add up to at least x (but we don't know which ones).\n\n But here's the key: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the pairing of the two lists to form the participants? Actually, no: the two lists are the two tours, so each participant has one element from the first list and one from the second list. However, the problem does not specify that the i-th element of the first list is the same participant as the i-th element of the second list.\n\n Therefore, we can consider that we have two multisets of scores (the first tour and the second tour). We are free to assign any pairing (a_i, b_j) to form a participant. However, note that the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning that we have n participants, each with one score from the first tour and one score from the second tour.\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that the two lists are the same set of participants. Actually, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", and the same n participants. So we have two lists of n numbers, and we are going to form n pairs (one from the first list and one from the second list) arbitrarily (but each element used exactly once) to represent the two scores of each participant.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say we can reassign arbitrarily. Actually, the problem says: \"The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour but the problem is, the results have only points, no names.\" So the teacher doesn't know which participant got which score in which tour. Therefore, the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n Now, the goal is to find the best and worst place Vasya could have gotten.\n\n How to think:\n\n We know that Vasya's total is at least x. But note: we don't know exactly what his two scores are. However, we know that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x (and that pair is Vasya's).\n\n But note: the problem says \"Vasya got at least x points for both tours\", so his total is at least x.\n\n However, the catch: the entire table is built from the two lists. We can form the entire set of participants by pairing the two lists arbitrarily. But note: the problem does not require that we use the same index for the same participant. We are free to assign any pairing.\n\n Steps:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on the given scores from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total score is at least `x`, and we can strategically pair the scores from the first and second tours to maximize or minimize his rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We have two lists of scores from the first and second tours. Each participant has one score from each list, but the pairing is arbitrary.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`. Our task is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya could achieve by considering all possible valid pairings.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To place Vasya as high as possible, pair the highest possible scores from the first tour with the highest possible scores from the second tour, ensuring Vasya's total is at least `x`.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To place Vasya as low as possible, pair the lowest possible scores from the first tour with the lowest possible scores from the second tour, again ensuring Vasya's total is at least `x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Sort both lists of scores to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Binary Search**: Use binary search to quickly find the minimum scores needed to ensure Vasya's total meets or exceeds `x` for both the best and worst scenarios.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Binary search operations take O(log n) time.\n   - Overall complexity is dominated by sorting, making it O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    def find_min_score(a, b, x):\n        total = 0\n        j = len(b) - 1\n        for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] > x:\n                total += 1\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        return total\n\n    def find_max_score(a, b, x):\n        total = 0\n        j = len(b) - 1\n        for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n                total += 1\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        return total\n\n    min_place = find_min_score(a_list, b_list, x)\n    max_place = find_max_score(a_list, b_list, x)\n\n    print(f\"{max_place} {min_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n` and the minimum required total score `x`, followed by the scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n3. **Finding Best Rank (`find_max_score`)**:\n   - Iterate from the highest score in the first list.\n   - For each score, find the highest score in the second list such that their sum is at least `x`.\n   - Count how many participants can be formed with scores higher than or equal to Vasya's, determining his best possible rank.\n4. **Finding Worst Rank (`find_min_score`)**:\n   - Similarly, iterate from the highest scores but count how many participants must have scores strictly higher than Vasya's to ensure his total is at least `x`, thus determining his worst possible rank.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and binary search to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity.",
