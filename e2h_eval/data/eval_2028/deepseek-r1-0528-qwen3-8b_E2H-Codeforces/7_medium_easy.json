The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to determine for a given n (which can be up to 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and a nonnegative integer t (the number of steps) such that the total number of vertices is n.\n\n The snowflake construction:\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k new vertices. Now total = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., the leaves from the previous step) will add k new vertices. But note: initially after step 1, we have one central vertex (degree k) and k leaves (each degree 1). Then each leaf adds k new ones. However, note that the central vertex is already connected and won't be used again? Actually, the rule says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (so leaves) are expanded. In step 2, we have k * (k) new vertices.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning we must do step 1 (at least). Then we can do more steps.\n\n Let's break down the structure:\n\n   Level 0: 1 node (center).\n   Level 1: k nodes (attached to center).\n   Level 2: k*k nodes (each level-1 node gets k children).\n\n But wait: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaves) must be expanded. So after step 1, we have k leaves. Then in step 2, we expand each of these k leaves, so we get k*k new leaves. Then step 3: we would expand each of these k*k leaves, getting k^3, etc.\n\n However, note that the center node is not a leaf (unless k=1, but k>1) and the leaves from step i (say at depth i) are expanded at step i+1.\n\n Therefore, if we do t steps (with t>=1), then:\n\n   Step 0: 1 node.\n   Step 1: adds k nodes -> total = 1 + k\n   Step 2: adds k^2 nodes -> total = 1 + k + k^2\n   ...\n   Step t: adds k^t nodes -> total = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\n But note: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" and then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This means we must do the first expansion (step 1) and then we can do at least one more expansion? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process (after the initial) must be done at least once. But note the initial step is separate. The description says:\n\n   Rule 1: Start with one vertex.\n   Rule 2: Then, connect the initial vertex to k new vertices (k>1). [This is the first expansion]\n   Rule 3: Then, each vertex with degree 1 (which are the leaves) must be expanded (by connecting them to k new vertices) and this expansion step (Rule 3) must be done at least once.\n\n However, note that the initial expansion (Rule 2) is not the same as Rule 3. The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves (Rule 3) must be performed at least once. So actually, we must have at least two expansions? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   After Rule 2: we have 1 + k vertices.\n   Then, the problem says we must do the step (Rule 3) at least once. So we must add k^2 vertices.\n\n Therefore, the minimal snowflake (for k) has n_min = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n But wait: what if we do only one expansion (Rule 2) and then stop? The problem says \"This step [meaning the expansion of leaves] should be done at least once\". So we must do at least one leaf expansion. Hence, the minimal expansion is two steps: Rule 2 and then Rule 3 at least once.\n\n However, note: the example for k=4 shows the smallest snowflake. The example figure probably shows the minimal one (with two layers). \n\n But the problem does not require that we stop at the minimal expansion. We can do more than one expansion of leaves. For example, we can do t times the leaf expansion (with t>=1) and then the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(t+1)   ??? Wait, let's count carefully.\n\n Actually, the process:\n\n   Step 0: 1 node.\n   Step 1: add k nodes (from center) -> total 1+k.\n   Step 2: each of the k leaves from step 1 adds k nodes -> total 1+k+k^2.\n\n   If we do a third step: then each of the k^2 leaves from step 2 adds k nodes -> total 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n So if we do m leaf expansions (m>=1), then the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m+1)   ?\n\n Actually, note: the first expansion (from the center) is the initial step, then the next expansion is the first leaf expansion, then the second leaf expansion, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as having:\n\n   Layer 0: the center (1 node)\n   Layer 1: k nodes\n   Layer 2: k^2 nodes\n   ...\n   Layer i: k^i nodes\n\n And we have at least two layers (so m>=1, meaning we have layers 0 to m, and m>=1). Then the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n But wait, the initial expansion (step 1) is layer 1, and then the next expansion (step 2) is layer 2, and so on until layer m. The problem says the expansion of leaves must be done at least once, so m>=1.\n\n However, note that the example input: \n   Input: 6 -> output NO, 13 -> YES.\n\n Let's test with n=13: \n   We need to check if there exists k>1 and m>=1 (number of expansions, which gives layers 1 to m) such that:\n\n      1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = 13\n\n   Or, if we consider the entire series including the center and up to m layers (so m+1 terms, but the center is the 0-th layer, then layers 1 to m):\n\n      n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)   [if k>1]\n\n   But note: the minimal expansion (m=1) gives 1 + k + k^2. For k=2: 1+2+4=7, k=3: 1+3+9=13 -> so yes.\n\n   What about n=6?\n        We need to find k>1 and m>=1 such that (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = 6.\n\n        Possibilities:\n          m=1: then 1+k+k^2 = 6 -> k^2+k+1=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> no integer solution for k>1.\n          m=2: then 1+k+k^2+k^3 = 6 -> k^3+k^2+k+1=6. For k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big. k=1 is not allowed.\n\n        Alternatively, note: the formula for m layers (including the center and layers 1 to m) is the geometric series with m+1 terms. But wait: in our breakdown, the center is included and then m layers (each layer being the expansion). Actually, the problem states:\n\n          Step 0: center (layer0)\n          Step 1: layer1 (k nodes)\n          Step 2: layer2 (k^2 nodes)\n\n        So for m=1 (only one leaf expansion) we have layers 0,1,2? Actually, no: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added\" (the first expansion) and then \"This step should be done at least once\" (meaning the expansion of leaves, which is the second step). So the minimal expansion is two layers (the center, then the first ring, then the second ring). But wait, the center is the initial, then we do the first expansion (ring1) and then we must do the leaf expansion (ring2). So the minimal is two rings (layers 0,1,2) and total layers considered: 3 (0-indexed: 0,1,2).\n\n        Therefore, the formula is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        where m>=2? Actually, the problem says the expansion of leaves must be done at least once. The expansion of leaves happens after the first expansion (ring1). So we must have at least ring2. Therefore, the minimal expansion is m=2 (two expansions: the initial expansion and then one leaf expansion). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        But wait: the example says for n=6, output 'NO'. Let's check with m=1 (meaning only the initial expansion and then one leaf expansion, so two expansions in total? Actually, we have:\n\n          Layer0: 1\n          Layer1: k\n          Layer2: k^2\n\n        Then n=1+k+k^2.\n\n        For k=2: 1+2+4=7 -> not 6.\n        For k=3: 1+3+9=13 -> too big.\n\n        Also, m=2: meaning we do two leaf expansions? Then:\n\n          Layer0: 1\n          Layer1: k\n          Layer2: k^2\n          Layer3: k^3\n\n          Then n=1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n        For k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> too big.\n\n        So 6 cannot be represented.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that we must stop after the minimal expansion. We can choose the number of layers arbitrarily (as long as at least two layers, i.e., m>=2). But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves must be done at least once, so we must have at least two layers (center, then the first ring, then the second ring). \n\n        But wait, there's another possibility: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is expanded. In the initial expansion, we have k leaves (each connected only to the center). Then we expand each leaf by k new vertices. Then those new vertices become leaves. Then we can choose to stop or continue. So the minimal expansion (one leaf expansion) gives 1+k+k^2, but we can also do two leaf expansions (so total layers: 0,1,2,3) and then n=1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n        However, note: the expansion is defined recursively: we must do the expansion at least once (on the leaves). But we are allowed to do more. So the total number of vertices is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some m>=2 (since the minimal expansion requires two expansions: the initial and then one leaf expansion, so layers 0,1,2 -> m=2, meaning the highest exponent is 2).\n\n        But wait: the initial expansion (step 1) is the first expansion (k) and then the leaf expansion (step 2) is the second expansion (k^2). Then we can have:\n\n          m=2: n = 1 + k + k^2\n          m=3: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n          m=4: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + k^4\n\n        And so on.\n\n        So the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer m>=2.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the expansion step (leaf expansion) must be done at least once, meaning m>=1 (if we consider the number of leaf expansions as m, then the total layers are m+1 (including the center and the initial expansion))? \n\n        Actually, if we let t be the number of expansions (including the initial expansion) then we have:\n\n          Expansion 0: center (no expansion)\n          Expansion 1: initial expansion (adds k) -> then we have done 1 expansion (non-leaf expansion) and then we must do at least one leaf expansion.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as having:\n\n          Step 0: center (vertex 0)\n          Step 1: add k (first expansion) -> now we have done one expansion (the initial one) and the leaves are the k nodes.\n          Step 2: expand each leaf (second expansion) -> adds k^2.\n\n        Then the condition is that we must have at least one leaf expansion (step2). So the minimal expansion is two expansions (steps 1 and 2). Then the total number of expansions is 2 (so the series goes up to k^2). \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify that we must stop after the minimal expansion. We can do more than two expansions (steps). So the total number of expansions (including the initial and the leaf expansions) is at least 2, but can be more.\n\n        So the equation is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   for some integer t>=2 (where t is the total number of expansions, i.e., the highest power is k^(t-1) because the first expansion is k^1, the second is k^2, etc.)\n\n        Actually, if we do t expansions (steps), then the exponents go from 0 to t-1? \n\n        Alternatively, we can denote:\n          Let r = the number of layers (excluding the center) then the total vertices is the sum_{i=0}^{r} k^i, but with the condition that the leaf expansion must occur at least once, so r>=2 (because the center is layer0, then layer1 and layer2 must exist).\n\n        But note: the center is included and then we have layers 1 to r (with r>=2). Then:\n\n          n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        Now, the problem: given n (which can be up to 10^18) and we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and r>=2 such that n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        However, note that n can be very large (up to 10^18). How can we solve this?\n\n        Observation:\n\n          Since k>=2 and r>=2, we have:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r >= 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^r.\n\n          The minimal n for a fixed r is when k=2: n_min(r) = 2^(r+1)-1.\n\n          Also, note that for a fixed k, as r increases, n grows exponentially.\n\n        Approach:\n\n          We can iterate over the possible number of layers (r) or over the base k? But note that k can be as large as n (but actually k is at most around n^(1/2) for r=2, but for larger r, k can be smaller).\n\n        Alternatively, we can fix the exponent r (the number of layers, excluding the center, so the total layers is r+1, but the expansion steps are r+1? Actually, the expansion steps: the center is step0, then step1 adds k, step2 adds k^2, ... step r adds k^r. Then the total vertices is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1). And we require r>=2 (so at least two expansions: step0 (center) and step1 (initial) and step2 (leaf expansion) -> then r=2? Actually, the expansion steps are from 1 to r (with step0 being the center). Then the total expansions (steps) is r (steps 1 to r). But the problem requires at least one leaf expansion (step2) so we must have r>=2.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"This step [expanding the leaves] should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of leaves (step2) must be done at least once. So we must have at least two expansion steps (step1 and step2). Therefore, r (the last expansion step) must be at least 2.\n\n        So we need to check if there exists k>1 and r>=2 such that:\n\n          n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate over k and r blindly.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          Note that the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n            n = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   (r+1 terms, but the inner part has r terms)\n\n          Another way: the equation is a polynomial in k of degree r.\n\n        We can consider the following:\n\n          Case 1: r=2 (minimal case). Then:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n            => k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0.\n\n            Discriminant: D = 1 - 4(1-n) = 4n-3.\n\n            Then k = (-1 + sqrt(4n-3)) / 2 must be an integer greater than 1.\n\n          Case 2: r>=3.\n\n        But note: the problem has a constraint on n (up to 10^18) and we have up to 10000 test cases.\n\n        However, note that for a fixed n, the possible values of r (the exponent) are limited because even for k=2, the value of n grows as 2^(r+1)-1, which for r=60 is 2^61-1 ~ 2e18, so r is at most around 60 (if k=2) or even less for larger k.\n\n        So we can iterate over the possible exponents r from 2 up to, say, 200 (but 2^200 is astronomically huge, so we must break when the minimal n (for k=2) exceeds 10^18). \n\n        Steps for one test case:\n\n          If n==1: then the center alone. But the problem requires at least one expansion (so the minimal is 1+k+k^2 with k>1 -> at least 1+2+4=7). So n=1 is NO.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" (leaf expansion) so we must have at least two layers (center, then two layers). So n must be at least 1+2+4=7.\n\n          But wait: the example input includes 1,2,3,6,13,15,... so we have to consider n=1,2,3,6 which are below 7.\n\n          We can break down:\n\n            n=1: NO (as above)\n            n=2: NO\n            n=3: NO\n            n=6: NO\n            n=7: 1+2+4 -> YES (k=2, r=2)\n\n          However, wait: the equation for r=2: n=1+k+k^2. For k=2: 7, so 7 is YES.\n\n          But what about n=15? \n            r=2: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1 + sqrt(57) )/2 -> not integer.\n            r=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. Try k=2: 8+4+2-14=0 -> yes. So k=2, r=3 -> n=15.\n\n          So n=15 is YES.\n\n          Algorithm for one test case (n):\n\n            If n <= 1: \n                return \"NO\"\n\n            Check the minimal case: r=2 (then k must be integer and >1). Solve k^2+k+1 = n.\n\n            Then check for r>=3: we can iterate over exponents r from 3 up to the maximum such that the minimal n (for k=2) is <= 10^18.\n\n            However, note: the equation for a fixed r is:\n\n                n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n            We can solve for k by considering k as the root of the equation:\n\n                (k^(r+1)-1) = n*(k-1)\n\n            But note: we are iterating over r (the exponent, which is the total layers excluding the center? Actually, note: the expansion steps: the last expansion is the r-th expansion (so the highest power is k^r). Then the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n            We can use binary search for k for a fixed r? But note: k must be integer and k>=2.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note that for a fixed r, the function f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>=2. So we can set:\n\n                k_min = 2\n                k_max = n  (because if k=n, then the series would be 1+n (if r=1) but we have r>=2, so we have at least 1+n+n^2, so k_max can be set to floor(n^(1/r)) or something)\n\n            But note: the equation for fixed r and n: \n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n            We can try to bound k: since k^r <= n (because the last term is k^r, and the rest are positive), so k <= n^(1/r). \n\n            However, we can also use the fact that:\n\n                k^r < n < k^(r+1)   ??? Not exactly, because the entire series is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) which is approximately k^r/(k-1) for large k.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            We know that for fixed r, the equation is:\n\n                n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n            We can write:\n\n                k^(r+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n            But solving for k is difficult.\n\n            Instead, we can iterate over the exponents r from 2 up to a limit (like 200) and for each r, solve for k by taking the (r+1)-th root? Actually, we can use:\n\n                k^r <= n < (k+1)^r   is not the equation.\n\n            Actually, note: the entire series is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n            We can also express:\n\n                k^r <= n <= (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) <= (k^(r+1))/(k-1)\n\n            But we can also note that:\n\n                n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) => k^r + k^(r-1) + ... + k + 1 = n.\n\n            We can use binary search for k for a fixed r? But note: n can be as large as 10^18, and r is at most around 60 (because 2^60 is about 1e18, so r is at most 60 for k=2). \n\n            Steps for fixed r (from 2 up to about 200, but we can break when the minimal value for k=2 becomes greater than n):\n\n                Let f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)//(k-1)   [integer division?] but we are working with integers.\n\n                We know k must be at least 2 and at most floor(n^(1/r)) (or even better: the largest k such that k^r <= n).\n\n                Actually, the entire series is greater than k^r (the last term) and less than (k^(r+1))/(k-1). \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n                We have n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n                => k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n                But we can also use logarithms? However, we are in integers.\n\n            However, note: we are iterating over r (which is the exponent, from 2 to about 60) and for each r, we can compute k by taking the (r+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1? That doesn't help.\n\n        Another idea:\n\n          Since k is at least 2 and the series is increasing with k, we can try to find k for a fixed r by solving:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n          We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] (but n can be 10^18, so we cannot iterate over k). However, note that for fixed r, k must satisfy:\n\n            k^r <= n   (because the last term is k^r and the rest are positive)\n\n            and\n\n            n <= (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)   [but we know that]\n\n          We can set:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = pow(n, 1/r) + 1   (we can use integer root)\n\n          But note: the entire series is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) which is much bigger than k^r. Actually, the series is:\n\n            n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) > k^r   (for k>=2, and r>=1)\n\n          So we can set high = int(round(n**(1/r))) + 10   (but careful: we are dealing with integers)\n\n        However, we can use:\n\n            k_min = 2\n            k_max = 10**6   # but wait, if r=2, then k^2 <= n, so k_max = sqrt(n) which can be 1e9 -> too big to iterate.\n\n        We need a smarter way: we can use binary search for k for fixed r.\n\n        Steps for fixed r:\n\n          We know k is at least 2 and at most (let M = floor(n**(1/r)) + 1) but note the series is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) and we have:\n\n            (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) >= k^r   (which is true)\n\n          Actually, we can set an upper bound for k: \n\n            k^r <= n   (because the last term is k^r, and the whole series is at least k^r)\n\n          So k <= n**(1/r)\n\n          Then we can set:\n\n            k_low = 2\n            k_high = int(n**(1/r)) + 10   (we add 10 to avoid rounding issues)\n\n          Then we can do a binary search for k in [k_low, k_high] such that:\n\n            s = (k**(r+1)-1) // (k-1)   [but wait, k**(r+1) might be too big? For r=60 and k=2, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is acceptable for Python integers? Yes, but for k=10**6 and r=10, that would be (10**6)^11 = 10^66, which is too big to compute.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the series is increasing with k and with r. \n\n        But note: the problem has up to 10^4 test cases and we are iterating over r from 2 to about 60 (max_r: when k=2, then n = 2^(r+1)-1, so 2^(r+1) <= n+1, so r+1 <= log2(n+1). For n=10^18, log2(10^18) is about 60, so r from 2 to 60). Then for each test case, we iterate over about 60 values of r, and for each r we do a binary search over k (which is from 2 to about n^(1/r)). \n\n        However, the value of k for a fixed r is bounded by n^(1/r). For example, for r=2, k is about sqrt(n). For n=10^18, sqrt(n)=10^9, so the binary search for k in [2, 10^9] would take about 30 iterations per r. Then for each test case, we do 60*30 = 1800 iterations, and with 10^4 test cases, that would be 1800 * 10000 = 18e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n        But wait: the problem says n can be up to 10^18, but note that for a fixed r, the k we are searching for is the base such that the geometric series equals n. However, for large r, the k is small. For example, for r=60, k^60 <= n, so k <= n^(1/60). For n=10^18, (10^18)^(1/60) is 10^(18/60)=10^0.3 ~ 2. So for r=60, k is at most 2. Then the binary search for k for r=60 would be over [2,2] (because 2^60 is about 1e18, so k=2 is the candidate).\n\n        Actually, we can break the iteration for r: for a fixed n, the maximum r we need to consider is the maximum integer r such that the minimal value (for k=2) is <= n. The minimal value for k=2 is (2^(r+1)-1)/(2-1)=2^(r+1)-1. So we require 2^(r+1)-1 <= n. Then r_max = floor(log2(n+1))-1.\n\n        Steps for one test case:\n\n          if n <= 6:   # because the smallest valid n is 7 (for k=2, r=2: 1+2+4=7)\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              found = False\n              # Consider r from 2 to r_max (inclusive), where r_max = floor(log2(n+1))-1 (so that 2^(r_max+1)-1 <= n)\n\n              # But note: we don't know the base k, so we cannot use base 2 for all. We'll iterate r from 2 to r_max (which is at most 60 for n=10^18).\n\n              # For each r in [2, r_max]:\n                  # We want to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n                  #   n = (k^(r+1)-1) // (k-1)\n\n                  # We can use binary search for k in the range [2, k_high], where k_high = floor(n**(1/r)) + 1   (because k^r <= n)\n\n                  # However, note: the entire series is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) which is greater than k^r. So k_high can be set to floor(n**(1/r)) + 1, but we must ensure that k_high is at least 2.\n\n              # But note: we cannot compute k_high by n**(1/r) for very large n and small r (like r=2, n=10^18 -> 1e9) but that's acceptable.\n\n              # However, we can use:\n\n                  # k_low = 2\n                  # k_high = 10**6   # but wait, for r=2, k_high should be about sqrt(n) which can be 1e9, so we need to set k_high = int(round(n**(1/r))) + 10\n\n              # But computing n**(1/r) for n=10**18 and r=2: 10**9, which is acceptable.\n\n              # But for r=1: we skip (r>=2). For r=2: k_high = int(n**(1/2)) + 10. Then we do a binary search for k in [2, k_high] such that (k^(r+1)-1)//(k-1) == n.\n\n              # However, note: we are using integer arithmetic and the formula (k^(r+1)-1)//(k-1) might be computed exactly for k and r.\n\n              # But note: k**(r+1) might be too big for large r? Actually, for r=60, k=2, then 2**61 is 2.3e18, which is acceptable for Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation for base 2 and exponent 61 is fast). But for k=10**9 and r=2, then k^3 is (10**9)**3 = 10**27, which is acceptable? Actually, 10**27 is a big integer but we are doing it for one k per binary search step, and we do about 30 steps per r, and 60 r's per test case, and 10^4 test cases -> worst-case 10^4 * 60 * 30 = 18e6 * (cost of one exponentiation). \n\n              # The exponentiation: we are computing k**(r+1) for k and r. The maximum k is about n**(1/r) and r is at most 60, and n=10^18. The maximum k is 10^18**(1/60) which is around 10^(0.3) -> 2 (as above). So for large r, k is small. For small r, k can be large (like 10^9 for r=2). But 10^9 raised to the 3rd power (for r=2, we need k^3) is 10^27, which is acceptable for Python (it is an integer, and we have to do about 30*60 = 1800 exponentiations per test case? Actually, no: we are doing a binary search for each r, and in each binary search we do O(log(k_high)) steps, and each step does one exponentiation.\n\n              # However, we can avoid the exponentiation by using a different method? \n\n          Alternate approach for fixed r and n:\n\n            We want to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n                S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r = n.\n\n            We can use the formula for the geometric series:\n\n                S = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n            => k^(r+1) = n*(k-1) + 1.\n\n            But we can also use the fact that k must be an integer and we can check k from 2 up to min(?, n**(1/r)) by using the binary search. \n\n          However, we can also use the following: \n\n            Since k^r <= n, then k <= n**(1/r). We can compute k0 = floor(n**(1/r)) and then check k0 and k0-1 and k0+1? Because the equation is very sensitive to k.\n\n          But note: the series is increasing with k, so we can do:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = int(round(n**(1/r))) + 10   # we set high to be a little above the root\n\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                # Compute S = (mid**(r+1)-1)//(mid-1)   [But wait, this is the entire series for exponent r, which is 1+mid+mid^2+...+mid^r]\n\n                # However, note: we are iterating for fixed r, and the series is defined for exponents from 0 to r (so r+1 terms). But the formula is (mid**(r+1)-1)//(mid-1) = 1+mid+mid^2+...+mid",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex (layer 0). Each subsequent layer \\( i \\) (for \\( i \\geq 1 \\)) adds \\( k^i \\) vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\) is a constant. The total number of vertices after \\( r+1 \\) layers (including the central vertex) is given by the geometric series sum \\( S = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices \\( n \\) must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and integer \\( r \\geq 2 \\). This translates to solving \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) for integers \\( k \\) and \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: For each test case, we check if \\( n \\) can be written in the form of the geometric series sum for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( r \\geq 2 \\).
