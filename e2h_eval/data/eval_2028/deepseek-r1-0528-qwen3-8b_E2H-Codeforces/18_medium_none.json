The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m, a, b (with m up to 10^9 and a, b up to 10^5)\n We are to compute S = sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)\n\n Recall: \n   - The frog starts at 0 and can jump by +a or -b.\n   - f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without leaving [0, x] (the frog doesn't have to use all jumps, but must stay within [0,x]).\n\n However, note that the frog can reach negative numbers? But the condition is: never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So we are only considering the non-negative side? Actually, the problem says \"never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]\" meaning that if the frog is at a position k, then it can only jump to k+a (if k+a <= x) or k-b (if k-b >= 0 and k-b <= x). But note: the problem says \"if it never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]\". So actually, the frog cannot even be at a negative position. Therefore, the set of reachable positions for a fixed x is the set of non-negative integers in [0, x] that are reachable from 0 using moves of +a and -b (without going below 0 or above x).\n\n But note: the frog can make multiple jumps. However, the problem does not require the frog to stay within [0, x] during the entire journey? Actually, the condition is that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So if the frog is at k (which is in [0, x]), then the next jump must land in [0, x]. \n\n Observation: \n   We are allowed to jump backwards (by -b) only if we don't go below 0. And we are allowed to jump forwards (by +a) only if we don't exceed x.\n\n However, note that the problem asks for the distinct integers the frog can reach (starting from 0) under the condition that the frog never leaves [0, x]. This means that the frog can also stop at any time.\n\n How to model the reachable set?\n\n Let's denote the set of positions reachable from 0 without leaving [0, x] as R(x). Note that the frog can jump arbitrarily many times, but must stay in [0, x].\n\n We can think of this as a graph where nodes are integers in [0, x] and edges from k to k+a (if k+a <= x) and from k to k-b (if k-b>=0). Then R(x) is the set of nodes reachable from 0.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the arithmetic progression and the linear Diophantine equations. However, note that the frog can use backward jumps to \"reset\" in some sense, but note that backward jumps require being at least b to go back.\n\n But note: the problem is defined for each x independently. However, we have to compute the sum from x=0 to x=m.\n\n Let's try small examples:\n\n Example 1: a=5, b=3, m=7.\n\n f(0): only 0 -> 1\n f(1): only 0 -> then 0+5=5 which is >1 -> so only 0. But wait, note: the frog doesn't need to visit all in one trip. However, the condition is that the frog can somehow reach the integer. But note: we are bounded by [0,1]. From 0, we can only jump to 0+5=5 which is >1 -> so not allowed. Also, we cannot jump backwards because we are at 0 and 0-3=-3 which is negative -> not allowed. So only 0 is reachable. But wait, the example says f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8.\n\n Let me check f(5):\n   Start at 0.\n   From 0: can jump to 0+5=5 (allowed because 5<=5) and 0-3=-3 (not allowed). So we have 0 and 5.\n   Now from 5: we can jump to 5+5=10 (which is >5 -> not allowed) and 5-3=2 (allowed because 2 is between 0 and 5). So we get 2.\n   From 2: jump to 2+5=7 (too high) and 2-3=-1 (negative, not allowed). So we have {0,5,2}. Hence 3.\n\n Similarly, f(6):\n   We can get 0, then 5 (then from 5 to 2), and then from 2 we cannot jump forward (2+5=7>6) and backward (2-3=-1 invalid). Also, from 0 we can jump backward? no. But wait, is there a way to get 1,3,4, etc.? \n   Let me see: \n      0 -> 5 (valid) then 5->2 (valid). Then from 2: no forward because 2+5=7>6, and backward not allowed. So we have {0,5,2}. But wait, what about starting from 0 and then jumping backward? no. What about 0->5->2-> ... but no. Also, is there a way to get 3? \n      Actually, let's try: \n        To get 3: \n          One way: 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> ... no.\n          Alternatively: 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 5 again? no, because from 2 we can't go to 5 (since 2+3 isn't allowed, the moves are +a and -b, so only +5 or -3). \n        Another way: from 0 we can't jump to 3 directly. \n\n   But wait, example says f(6)=3. So {0,2,5}. \n\n   Now for f(7):\n     We can get 0,5,2, and also from 2 we can now jump forward to 2+5=7 (which is <=7) and backward to 2-3=-1 (invalid). So we have 7. Also, from 5 we can jump forward to 10 (invalid) and backward to 2 (already have). From 0 we can jump forward to 5 (already have). So we have {0,2,5,7}. \n     But wait, how do we get 1? Not possible. Similarly, 3: \n        To get 3: \n          0 -> 5 -> 2 -> ? no. \n        Alternatively: 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 ... no.\n\n     But wait, maybe from 0 we can do two backward jumps? No, because we start at 0 and cannot jump backward from 0.\n\n     How about 3: \n        0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> ... no.\n\n     But wait, let's list the positions we have: \n        0: yes\n        1: no\n        2: yes\n        3: no\n        4: no\n        5: yes\n        6: 0->5->2->5-> ... no, but wait: from 0 we can jump to 5, then from 5 we can jump to 2, then from 2 we can jump to 7 (if x>=7). For x=7, we have 7. Also, from 5 we can jump to 2, and from 2 we can jump to 7, and from 7 we can jump to 7-3=4? \n        Wait, from 7: 7+a=12 (too big) and 7-b=4 (which is <=7). So from 7 we can get 4. Then from 4: 4+a=9 (too big) and 4-b=1 (which is <=7). So from 4 we get 1. Then from 1: 1+a=6 (<=7) and 1-b=-2 (invalid). So we get 6 from 1. Then from 6: 6+a=11 (too big) and 6-b=3 (<=7). So we get 3 from 6. Then from 3: 3+a=8 (too big) and 3-b=0 (which we have). \n\n     So the set for x=7 is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. That's 8 elements.\n\n     So the example says f(7)=8.\n\n Therefore, the set for x=7 includes all integers from 0 to 7.\n\n Now, how to compute f(x) for arbitrary x?\n\n We note that the frog's movements are linear. The reachable set is the set of integers that can be written as:\n   n * a - k * b   (with n,k nonnegative integers) and such that the entire process stays in [0, x].\n\n However, we can also think in terms of modulo arithmetic. Note that the frog can only reach numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo g, where g = gcd(a,b)? Actually, no, because we are allowed to mix positive and negative steps, but note the negative steps only occur when we are at a position at least b. However, we must ensure that the entire path stays non-negative.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the reachable set as the set of numbers that can be represented as:\n   t = k*a - l*b, with k,l nonnegative integers, and the condition that the entire sequence (when building the path) never goes negative and never exceeds x.\n\n But note: we are bounded by [0, x] so we cannot use too many steps.\n\n However, note that the problem requires the sum for i from 0 to m, and m can be up to 10^9. We cannot iterate over each i.\n\n We need to find a pattern or formula for f(x).\n\n Observation: The frog can only reach numbers that are in the arithmetic progression of step g = gcd(a,b). Why? Because every jump changes the residue modulo g by multiples of g. Since a and b are divisible by g, then every reachable number must be divisible by g.\n\n However, wait: \n   Let g = gcd(a,b). Then the set of numbers that can be formed by linear combinations of a and -b (without the non-negativity constraint) is the set of multiples of g. But note the non-negativity and the boundaries.\n\n But note: the backward jump subtracts b, so we can subtract multiples of b. However, we must have built up enough by adding a to subtract. \n\n However, the example: a=5, b=3, g=1. Then every integer should be reachable? But wait, in the example for x=5, we only reached {0,2,5}. So not every integer. \n\n Actually, the set of numbers that are reachable without the boundary condition (i.e., without the [0, x] restriction) is the set of numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo g, and then we can adjust by the Diophantine equation. But note: the backward jump is only allowed if we are at a position >= b.\n\n However, note that the frog is constrained by the boundaries. \n\n Let's reexamine: the frog can only reach numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo g? Actually, no: in the example, 0,2,5: \n   0 mod 1 = 0, 2 mod 1=0, 5 mod 1=0. So they are all multiples of 1 (so all integers). But wait, then why didn't we get 1,3,4 in x=5?\n\n The issue is that the backward jump requires having a positive amount to subtract. So we cannot arbitrarily subtract. \n\n Alternate approach: \n\n We can define:\n   Let g = gcd(a, b). Then the set of numbers that can be reached (ignoring the boundaries) is the set of multiples of g. However, the boundaries and the fact that we can only subtract when we have at least b might restrict the set.\n\n But note: the example a=5, b=3, g=1. Then we should be able to reach every integer eventually? But in x=5, we only reached 0,2,5. \n\n Actually, the problem is that the backward jump is limited by the current position. We cannot jump backward from 0, and from 5 we can jump backward to 2, but then from 2 we cannot jump backward (because 2<3). And from 2 we cannot jump forward beyond 7 (which is more than 5). So we are stuck.\n\n Therefore, the reachable set is not simply the set of multiples of g in [0, x], but a subset of them.\n\n We need to characterize the set of reachable numbers.\n\n Let d = gcd(a, b). Then we can write a = d * a', b = d * b'. Then the moves are: +d*a' and -d*b'. The set of numbers that can be represented without the boundary condition is the set of multiples of d. But the boundary condition and the requirement of non-negative intermediate steps complicates.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use as many steps as we want, but the frog must stay in [0, x]. \n\n How to compute f(x) for a given x?\n\n We can use BFS for small x, but m can be up to 10^9 so we need a formula.\n\n Insight:\n\n Consider the entire set of reachable numbers (without the upper bound x) from 0. We can only use backward jumps if we have built up a sufficient amount by forward jumps. \n\n Actually, note that the frog can also jump backward from a higher state. So the set of reachable numbers is the set of numbers that are multiples of g (g=gcd(a,b)) and that can be written as:\n\n   n = k * a - l * b\n\n But with the constraints that the entire sequence never goes negative and never exceeds x? Actually, we are defining the set for a fixed x.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the set of states (positions) that are reachable from 0 without exceeding x and without going negative. \n\n This is similar to a graph with nodes from 0 to x, and edges from k to k+a (if k+a<=x) and from k to k-b (if k>=b). Then we are counting the connected component containing 0.\n\n However, the graph is directed and acyclic? Not necessarily: we can go from 0 to a, then from a to a-b, then from a-b to a-b+a, etc. But note: we can cycle? \n\n Example: a=5, b=5: then from 0->5, then 5->0 (if we allow 5-5=0). Then we have a cycle. But note: the problem says the frog doesn't need to visit all in one trip, but the set is the distinct integers that can be reached. So we are just interested in the set.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the frog to use minimal steps or anything. \n\n We can think of the reachable set as the set of numbers that are:\n\n   n = t (mod d)   [where d = gcd(a,b)] and then satisfy some conditions.\n\n However, since d divides both a and b, then the set of residues modulo d is just one residue: 0. So all reachable numbers are multiples of d.\n\n Now, what are the multiples of d that are reachable?\n\n We can use the coin problem (Frobenius number) but note that we are allowed to use arbitrarily many coins (a and -b) and the goal is to represent numbers that are multiples of d. However, the backward jump is constrained by the current state.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to the classic two jug problem but with boundaries.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let g = gcd(a, b). Then the frog can only reach numbers that are multiples of g.\n\n Now, we need to know for a given x, which multiples of g in [0, x] are reachable.\n\n But note: the backward jump requires that we have a positive balance to subtract. \n\n Consider: we start at 0. We can only add. Then we can subtract if we have at least b. \n\n The key is to observe that we can only reach numbers that are multiples of g, and then we can break down the problem by considering the quotient: divide everything by g.\n\n Let:\n   a' = a // g, b' = b // g.\n\n Then the moves become: +a' (which is a multiple of g) and -b' (which is a multiple of g). Then the state is an integer (the position divided by g). \n\n Now, the problem reduces to: \n   Start at 0, and from a state k (nonnegative integer) we can jump to k+a' or k-b' (if k>=b').\n\n Then the original state x becomes x' = x // g (but note: we are only considering multiples of g, so we consider the multiples of g up to x).\n\n However, we are counting distinct integers, so we count the integer k (in the reduced system) such that k*g is in [0, x] and k is reachable.\n\n But note: the original problem counts every integer that is a multiple of g that is reachable. However, the example: a=5, b=3, g=1, so we are counting every integer that is reachable.\n\n Now, what is the set of reachable numbers (in the reduced system)?\n\n In the reduced system, we have moves: +a' and -b'. We want to know which nonnegative integers (in the reduced system) are reachable and then bounded by x//g.\n\n But note: the reduced system has the same structure. \n\n We can use the concept of the smallest multiple that can be subtracted. \n\n However, note that the problem is symmetric to the classic coin problem but with two operations: adding a' and subtracting b'. \n\n But wait, we are allowed to use backward jumps only when we have built up enough. \n\n There is a known result: the set of numbers reachable from 0 by adding a' and subtracting b' (with subtraction only when the current value is at least b') is the set of numbers that are >= some minimum value and that are congruent to 0 modulo g? Actually, no, because we are already dividing by g so the modulus is 1 (since g=gcd(a,b) and we divided by g, then gcd(a',b')=1). Then the classic coin problem tells us that there exists a Frobenius number for the two coins a' and b' (if we ignore the non-negativity of subtraction) but here subtraction is constrained.\n\n Actually, we can use the concept of the \"state space\" modulo (a'+b')? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of breaking the problem into cycles. \n\n Insight from competitive programming problems (like the classic frog jump problems):\n\n We can consider the state modulo (a+b) or something else? \n\n However, note that the moves are +a' and -b'. The total move is a' - b' per cycle? \n\n Actually, consider: \n   We can simulate the process as a graph on the residues modulo (a'+b')? \n\n But note: the moves are independent of modulus. \n\n Another idea: we can consider the possibility of reaching a state k if and only if k is a nonnegative integer (in the reduced system) and k >= some lower bound and k ≡ r (mod L) for some LCM? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the frog can reach a state k (multiple of g) if and only if k is at least the smallest multiple that can be achieved by the linear combinations (with nonnegative coefficients) and then the rest are periodic.\n\n But note: we are allowed to subtract only when we have built up enough. \n\n Actually, we can use dynamic programming for small states, but m can be huge.\n\n However, note that the reduced system has parameters a' and b' which are at most 10^5 (since a,b<=10^5 and g>=1, so a',b' <=10^5). \n\n But we cannot iterate from 0 to m (which is 10^9) for each x.\n\n We need to find a way to compute the set of reachable numbers for a given x without iterating over each number.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   Let g = gcd(a, b). Then the set of reachable numbers (without the upper bound) is the set of numbers that are multiples of g and that can be written as:\n\n        k = t * (a'*b' - something) ??? \n\n Actually, we can use the theory of linear Diophantine equations. The equation is:\n\n        k = x1 * a' - x2 * b'\n\n with x1, x2 nonnegative integers, and the condition that the entire process never goes negative. \n\n But note: the backward jumps are only allowed when we have built up the necessary amount. \n\n However, we can consider the following:\n\n   We can only subtract if we have at least b'. So the net effect is that we can subtract at most (k // b') * b' from the total amount we have added, but we must have added at least (x2 * b') to be able to subtract x2 * b'.\n\n   Then, k = x1 * a' - x2 * b' >= 0.\n\n   Rearranged: x1 * a' >= x2 * b'\n\n   This is always true if we consider that we build up by a' and then subtract by b'. \n\n   But note: we can interleave the jumps. \n\n   Actually, the classic solution for the two jug problem is that we can reach any multiple of g (here 1) that is greater than or equal to the Frobenius number for the two coins? But the Frobenius number for two coins a' and b' (coprime) is a'*b' - a' - b'. However, that is for the case of nonnegative combinations (only adding) but we are allowed to subtract as well. \n\n   But wait, our problem is different: we are allowed to subtract, but the subtraction requires having the amount. \n\n   Actually, we can reach any sufficiently large multiple of g? Not necessarily: consider a'=2, b'=3. Then we can reach 0,2,3,4,6,... but not 1. But wait, we are in the reduced system and g=1, so we need to reach all integers? \n\n   However, note: the moves are +2 and -3. Then:\n\n        0 -> 2 (then we can subtract 3? no, because 2<3) -> stuck at 2.\n\n        Then from 0, can we get 1? 0->2->? we cannot subtract. So 1 is unreachable.\n\n   So the condition is that the number must be a multiple of g (which is 1) and also must be representable by nonnegative solutions to:\n\n        k = 2*x1 - 3*x2\n\n   with the constraint that the entire process never goes negative. \n\n   But note: we can also consider the order. Actually, we can only subtract if we have at least 3. \n\n   So the process must have built up at least 3 to subtract. \n\n   Then the reachable numbers are those k (multiples of 1) for which there exists a sequence of moves that stays nonnegative and ends at k.\n\n   This is equivalent to: k must be at least -(-3)*floor(k/2) ??? \n\n   Actually, we can use the concept of the minimal representation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        Let k_min be the minimum value we can achieve (which might be negative) but we are constrained by nonnegative states. \n\n   But note: the problem sets boundaries [0, x]. \n\n   We need to count the numbers in [0, x] that are reachable.\n\n   Since the problem asks for the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m, we can break the problem by the value of g.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let g = gcd(a, b). Then the frog can only reach multiples of g.\n\n   Then, for a given x, the set of reachable numbers is the set of multiples of g in [0, x] that are reachable in the reduced system (with a'=a//g, b'=b//g) and then multiplied by g.\n\n   But note: the reduced system is independent of g. \n\n   Now, in the reduced system, we have:\n\n        Start at 0, and we can jump to k+a' or k-b' (if k>=b').\n\n        We wish to know the set of nonnegative integers (in the reduced system) that are <= x//g and that are reachable.\n\n   Then f(x) = (# of reachable numbers in the reduced system that are <= x//g) [but note: the reduced system counts the quotient by g, so the actual numbers are k*g, and k*g<=x -> k<=x//g]\n\n   But note: the reduced system may not reach every multiple of 1 (if g=1) because the moves are a' and b'. \n\n   However, note: in the reduced system, the set of reachable numbers is the set of integers (if g=1) that are >= 0 and that can be written as:\n\n        k = x1 * a' - x2 * b'\n\n   with x1, x2 nonnegative integers and the condition that at every step the state is nonnegative.\n\n   This is a classical problem of representing numbers with two operations: adding a' and subtracting b' (with the subtraction only allowed when the current value is at least b').\n\n   We can use the following idea:\n\n        Let d = a' and e = b' (so d and e are coprime? Actually, g = gcd(a,b) and we divided by g, so gcd(d,e)=1).\n\n        Then the set of reachable numbers is all integers >= N0 for some N0, and also some finite set of smaller numbers.\n\n        But note: we start at 0 and we can only add. Then we subtract when we have enough. \n\n        The key is to find the minimal value that can be represented and then the periodicity.\n\n   However, there is a known result: \n\n        In the classic coin problem with two denominations (d and e, coprime) and allowing negative coefficients (but with the constraint that the intermediate states are nonnegative) is complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the concept of the \"state space\" modulo (d+e). \n\n   Consider: the moves are +d and -e. Then the net change in a cycle (if we do one +d and one -e) is d-e, but we require d>=e to do a full cycle? \n\n   Actually, we can consider the following: \n\n        We can reach a state k if and only if k >= 0 and k is in the set generated by the moves.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use any number of moves.\n\n   There is a theorem: the set of reachable numbers (ignoring the nonnegative condition during the journey) is the set of multiples of g (which is 1) that are >= -F, but we have nonnegative states.\n\n   However, with the nonnegative state condition, we can only subtract after having built up. \n\n   After reading similar problems, we can use the following:\n\n        Let d = a', e = b'. Then the set of reachable numbers is the set of integers k (in the reduced system) such that k >= 0 and there exists a nonnegative integer t (the number of forward jumps) and a nonnegative integer s (the number of backward jumps) such that:\n\n            k = t*d - s*e\n\n            and t*d >= s*e   (because we must have built up t*d before subtracting s*e)\n\n        But note: the journey might have interleaving, but the condition t*d>=s*e must hold at the end? Actually, at the moment of the last subtraction, the state was at least e, but we are only counting the final state.\n\n        However, the minimal condition is that there exists a sequence of moves that leads to k without going negative. \n\n        But note: we can rearrange the moves arbitrarily? Actually, no: we must have at least e available to subtract. \n\n        This is equivalent to: k = t*d - s*e >= 0, and also the entire journey must not go negative. \n\n        But there is a stronger condition: we must be able to arrange the moves so that we never go negative. \n\n        However, we can show that if k = t*d - s*e >= 0, then there exists an arrangement (by doing all the additions first) that avoids negative states. \n\n        Why? Because we do t additions of d and s subtractions of e. The minimal state during the journey is min_{0<=i<=t} (i*d - j*e) for j from 0 to s, but if we do all additions first, the state goes from 0 to t*d, then we subtract. The minimal state would be t*d - s*e = k, and the intermediate states are nonnegative because we did all additions first. \n\n        However, wait: what if we interleave? Consider d=2, e=3, and k=2: \n            If we do one addition: 0->2, then we cannot subtract (2<3). So we are done. \n            But if we try to interleave: we cannot subtract until we have at least 3. So the condition is that we must do at least ceil(s*e/d) additions before the s-th subtraction? \n\n        Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that for every prefix of the sequence, the number of additions is at least (number of subtractions * e) / d. \n\n        But note: we are allowed to choose the order arbitrarily. The minimal state during the sequence is:\n\n            Let T_i = (number of additions up to i) * d - (number of subtractions up to i) * e.\n\n            We require T_i >=0 for every i.\n\n        The minimal state is minimized when we subtract as soon as possible. \n\n        To avoid going negative, the condition is that the total amount of additions must be at least the total amount of subtractions (in terms of the worst-case ordering). \n\n        Actually, the worst-case ordering is to do as many subtractions as early as possible. \n\n        The minimal state occurs at the point after the first subtraction: we must have at least e from the additions. Then after the second subtraction: we must have at least 2*e, etc.\n\n        So the condition is: the total additions must be at least the total subtractions (in terms of the product with their respective rates). \n\n        Specifically, the condition is: t*d >= s*e.\n\n        But note: k = t*d - s*e, so t*d >= s*e is equivalent to k>=0. \n\n        However, is that sufficient? \n\n        Example: d=2, e=3, k=2: then t*d=2, s*e=0 -> k=2, condition holds. And indeed we can reach 2.\n\n        Example: d=2, e=3, k=0: then t=0, s=0 -> k=0, condition holds.\n\n        Example: d=2, e=3, k=3: then we require t*d - s*e = 3. We can have t=3, s=1: 3*2 - 1*3 = 3. Condition: 3*2>=1*3 -> 6>=3 holds. But can we arrange the moves? \n            We can do: \n                Start: 0\n                Add: 0+2=2\n                Add: 2+2=4\n                Subtract: 4-3=1 -> not 3.\n\n            Alternatively: \n                Add: 0->2\n                Add: 2->4\n                Add: 4->6\n                Subtract: 6->3.\n\n            But wait, we can also: \n                Add: 0->2\n                Subtract: 2-> -1 -> invalid.\n\n            So the condition t*d>=s*e is necessary, but is it sufficient for the existence of a sequence that never goes negative?\n\n        Actually, we can prove by induction: \n\n            We want to know if there exists a sequence of t additions and s subtractions (total t+s moves) that ends at k = t*d - s*e and never goes negative.\n\n            Base: t=0, s=0 -> trivial.\n\n            Induction: assume we can do any (t,s) with t*d>=s*e.\n\n            How to insert one move? \n\n            But note: the condition t*d>=s*e is necessary because the final state is nonnegative. However, we must also ensure that at every step the state is nonnegative.\n\n            The minimal state in the entire sequence is the minimum of the running total. \n\n            We can use the greedy algorithm: do all additions first, then subtractions. Then the state goes from 0 to t*d, then drops to t*d - s*e. The minimal state is 0 (at the beginning) and then increases to t*d, then decreases to k. Since t*d>=s*e, we never drop below 0.\n\n            But wait, is that true? \n\n            Example: d=2, e=3, t=1, s=1: then k=2-3=-1 -> fails the condition t*d>=s*e (2>=3 is false) so we don't consider it.\n\n            Example: d=2, e=3, t=3, s=1: k=6-3=3, condition 6>=3 holds. Then the sequence: \n                0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 3.\n                Minimal state is 0, then 2, then 4, then 6, then 3 -> all nonnegative.\n\n            Example: d=2, e=3, t=2, s=1: k=4-3=1, condition 4>=3 holds. Sequence: \n                Option1: all additions then subtraction: 0->2->4->1 -> nonnegative.\n                Option2: interleaving: 0->2->-1 (invalid) -> so we must do all additions first.\n\n            Therefore, the sufficient and necessary condition is that there exist nonnegative integers t and s such that:\n\n                t*d - s*e = k   and   t*d >= s*e.\n\n            But note: k is fixed. We are solving for t and s.\n\n            We can rewrite: \n\n                t*d - s*e = k\n                => t*d = k + s*e\n\n            Then, we require k + s*e >= 0 and (k+s*e) is divisible by d, and s can be chosen arbitrarily as long as k+s*e is nonnegative and divisible by d.\n\n            But note: k is fixed and we are given k (the state in the reduced system). \n\n            However, we wish to know for a fixed k (>=0) whether there exists a nonnegative integer s such that:\n\n                (k + s*e) is divisible by d, and (k+s*e)//d * d >= s*e   [which is automatically satisfied if (k+s*e) is divisible by d and nonnegative?]\n\n            But note: (k+s*e) must be divisible by d. Since d and e are coprime (gcd(d,e)=1), then d divides k+s*e if and only if k+s*e ≡ 0 (mod d). \n\n            Then s*e ≡ -k (mod d). \n\n            Since gcd(e,d)=1, we can solve for s modulo d. Let s0 be the smallest nonnegative solution for s in the congruence:\n\n                s ≡ (-k * inv(e, d)) (mod d)\n\n            Then s = s0 + t*d (for t>=0) and then we require:\n\n                k + s*e >= 0   (which is true since k>=0 and s>=0, e>=0)\n\n            Then the smallest s is s0 (which is in [0, d-1]). Then we set s = s0 + t*d (for t>=0) and then t = (k + s*e) / d.\n\n            But note: we require that the entire journey is nonnegative, and we have shown that doing all additions first works. \n\n            Therefore, for a given k (>=0), it is reachable if and only if there exists a nonnegative integer s such that:\n\n                s*e ≡ -k (mod d)   and   k + s*e >= 0.\n\n            But note: k>=0 and s>=0, so the condition k+s*e>=0 is always true.\n\n            However, we must have k+s*e divisible by d.\n\n            So the condition is that k is congruent to (-s*e) mod d, and s is the smallest nonnegative solution for s in [0, d-1] for the congruence.\n\n            But note: we can also say that k must be congruent to (-s0*e) mod d, and s0 is the modular inverse.\n\n            Alternatively, we can say: k must be congruent to r (mod d) for some r that is achievable by -s*e mod d. Since s runs over all residues mod d, then -s*e mod d runs over all residues (because e is invertible mod d). \n\n            Therefore, every residue class modulo d appears. \n\n            Then, for a fixed k, there is always a solution for s (modulo d). \n\n            But note: k is in the reduced system and the reduced system uses integers. \n\n            However, we must have k+s*e divisible by d. \n\n            But since d and e are coprime, for any k, there exists s (possibly large) such that d divides k",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line for each integer from 0 to m. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units, but it must never land outside the interval [0, x] for any x in the range [0, m]. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The frog's movement is constrained to jumps of +a or -b, and it must stay within [0, x] for each x. The key observation is that the reachable positions are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'a' and 'b'. This reduces the problem to considering only these multiples.\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each x, the number of reachable positions is determined by solving a Diophantine equation in the reduced system where 'a' and 'b' are divided by their gcd. The solution involves checking if a particular multiple of the gcd can be expressed as a combination of the jumps without violating the non-negative constraint during the journey.\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints (m can be as large as 10^9), a brute-force approach is infeasible.
