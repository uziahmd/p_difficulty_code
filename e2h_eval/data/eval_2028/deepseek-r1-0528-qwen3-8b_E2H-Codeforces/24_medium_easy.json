She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider the segment [l, r] that we want to leave open.\n\n There are two main types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor (left/right) one tab at a time, but note that the boundaries change as tabs are closed.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that the problem allows closing either side from the current cursor position, and the boundaries a and b update as we close tabs.\n\n Observation:\n We need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. This means we must close tabs from 1 to l-1 (if any) and from r+1 to n (if any).\n\n The process can be broken down into two parts: \n   Part 1: Closing the left part (tabs 1 to l-1)\n   Part 2: Closing the right part (tabs r+1 to n)\n\n But note: we might be able to combine movements and closures in a way that minimizes the total seconds.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote:\n   current cursor position = pos\n\n We have two boundary points: l and r.\n\n The cursor must be moved to the left boundary (at least to l) to close the left side? Actually, to close the left side we must be at a position such that there are tabs to the left that we wish to close. Similarly for the right.\n\n However, note the operation: \n   - To close the left, we must be at a tab i (which is the last unclosed tab on the left) and then we close everything from a to i-1. But note: the condition says \"close all the tabs to the left\", meaning from the current minimum index (a) to i-1. Similarly for the right.\n\n But note: we don't necessarily need to move to the very left (l) to close the left part. Actually, if we are at a tab i where i > l, then the left closure operation will close from a to i-1. However, we must ensure that after closure, the leftmost tab is l. So we must close up to l-1.\n\n How do we think?\n\n We can consider two strategies:\n  1. First close the left part, then the right part.\n  2. First close the right part, then the left part.\n  3. Maybe even close both from the middle without moving too much.\n\n However, note that the closure operations are instantaneous once the cursor is at the correct position. The challenge is to get the cursor to the positions needed to perform the closures.\n\n The problem can be reduced to: we have two segments to close. We can choose to close the left first, then go to the right and close the right, or vice versa.\n\n But also, we can do multiple moves and multiple closures. However, note that each closure operation closes a contiguous set of tabs (either the entire left or the entire right). \n\n Since the problem is small (n <= 100), we can break it down by cases.\n\n Cases:\n\n  Case 1: If the entire range [l, r] is already the only open tabs, then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n  Actually, the initial state has all n tabs. We are going to close all tabs not in [l, r]. \n\n  We can consider the following:\n\n  Option 1: \n    Step 1: Move the cursor to the left until we are at l (or beyond?) and then close the left part? Actually, to close the left part, we must be at a tab that is >= l (because we cannot go beyond the boundaries). But note: if we are at a tab i, then the closure operation for the left will close from a to i-1. We want to close from the current left boundary (which initially is 1) to l-1. So we must be at a tab i such that i-1 >= l-1? Actually, no: the operation doesn't require that. The operation just closes from the current left boundary (which is 1) to i-1. So if we are at l, then we close from 1 to l-1. But if we are at l+1, then we close from 1 to l, which would remove l and that's bad. So we must be at l to close the left part without removing l? \n\n  However, note the problem: we are allowed to close only the left part (and then the right part). But we must leave [l, r] intact. Therefore, when closing the left, we must not close the tab l. So the operation \"close all to the left\" from a tab i must have i-1 being at least l-1? Actually, we can close the left part only if the left part is entirely to the left of l. So we must be at a tab i such that i >= l. Then the closure operation will close from a to i-1. We want to close from 1 to l-1. Therefore, we must have i-1 = l-1? Not necessarily: if we are at i (>= l), then we close from a to i-1. We want to close exactly [1, l-1]. So we require i-1 = l-1 -> i = l. So to close the left part, we must be at tab l.\n\n  Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at tab r.\n\n  But wait: what if we are at a tab greater than r? Then we close from i+1 to b, and if i>r then we close from i+1 to n, which includes [r+1, n] and also [r+1, i] (if i>n, but i cannot exceed n). However, if we are at a tab i (with i>r) then the closure operation for the right will close from i+1 to b. But we don't want to close the tab r. So we must not close r. Therefore, we must be at a tab i such that i <= r. But to close the right part, we must cover from r+1 to n. So we must be at a tab i such that i+1 <= r+1? Actually, the operation is defined as: close all tabs to the right, so from i+1 to b. We want to close from r+1 to n. Therefore, we must have i+1 = r+1? That would mean i = r. Then we close from r+1 to b. But if we are at r, then we close from r+1 to the current right boundary (which at the time of closure is n, unless we have already closed some on the right). \n\n  However, note: the problem does not specify that we must close the entire left or right in one go. But the operation is defined as closing all the tabs to the left (or right) of the cursor. So if we are at i, then the left closure removes all tabs from the current left boundary (which is the smallest index of an unclosed tab) to i-1. Similarly for the right.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"leave only the tabs from l to r\". So we must close all tabs not in [l, r]. \n\n  Therefore, the closure operations must remove:\n    Left: [1, l-1]\n    Right: [r+1, n]\n\n  Now, to remove [1, l-1] we must be at a tab i such that i-1 >= l-1? Actually, we must have i-1 >= l-1 and we must not remove l. The operation removes from the current left boundary (which is 1) to i-1. So if i-1 >= l-1, then we remove [1, i-1]. We require [1, l-1] to be removed. So we must have i-1 >= l-1, but also we don't want to remove l. So we must have i-1 = l-1? Because if i-1 > l-1, then we remove beyond l-1 (like l). So we must set i = l.\n\n  Similarly, for the right: we must be at a tab i such that i+1 <= r+1? Actually, we must remove [r+1, n]. The operation removes from i+1 to the current right boundary (which is n until we start closing). So we must set i = r.\n\n  Therefore, to close the left part, the cursor must be at l, and to close the right part, the cursor must be at r.\n\n  Then the problem becomes: how many seconds are needed to move the cursor from its initial position 'pos' to l (to close the left) and then to r (to close the right)? Or vice versa (first to r then to l)?\n\n  But note: we can also close the left part without moving to l? Actually, if we are at a tab i (>= l) then we can close the left part as long as i >= l. However, the operation will remove from 1 to i-1. To remove only [1, l-1] we need i-1 = l-1, i.e., i = l. Otherwise, if i > l, then we remove [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, i-1] which we don't want. \n\n  Similarly, for the right: we must be at r to avoid removing r.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at l to close the left, and at r to close the right.\n\n  Now, the plan:\n\n  We have two independent operations: \n      Operation A: Close left (requires being at l)\n      Operation B: Close right (requires being at r)\n\n  We can do them in two orders:\n\n  Option 1: \n      Start at pos, move to l (if necessary), then from l move to r (if necessary) and then close the right.\n\n  Option 2:\n      Start at pos, move to r, then from r move to l, then close the left.\n\n  However, note: once we close one side, the boundaries change. But since we are only concerned with the minimal seconds, and the closure operations are instantaneous, the movement cost is just the Manhattan distance (since we can move one step per second) but note: the movement is bounded by the current boundaries.\n\n  But wait: the problem says the movement is limited by the current boundaries (the min and max index of unclosed tabs). However, initially the boundaries are [1, n]. After closing the left part, the left boundary becomes l, so then moving from l to r would be from l to r (without any obstacle) because the remaining tabs are [l, n] (but then we haven't closed the right yet). Actually, after closing the left part, the tabs from 1 to l-1 are gone, so the current set of tabs is [l, n]. Then to close the right part, we need to be at r (within [l, n]) and then we close from r+1 to n. \n\n  However, the movement from l to r in the left-closed state is just |r-l| steps.\n\n  Similarly, if we first close the right part, then the set of tabs becomes [1, r], and then we move from r to l (which is |l-r| steps) and then close the left.\n\n  But note: we can also consider that we don't necessarily have to go to the exact boundaries (l and r) if we can use the fact that we can close from a position that is not exactly l or r? \n\n  Let me reexamine: \n\n  For the left closure, the operation requires that we are at a tab i (which must be in the current set of tabs) and then we close from the current left boundary to i-1. We want to close exactly [1, l-1]. Therefore, we must have i-1 = l-1, i.e., i = l. Similarly for the right.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right.\n\n  Then the total seconds is the sum of the movements from the initial pos to l (if we choose to close left first) and then from l to r. Similarly, if we choose to close right first, then from pos to r and then from r to l.\n\n  But note: we can also do both closures without moving the cursor from the initial position if the initial position is already covering both? Actually, if the initial pos is between l and r, then we can potentially close both from the same position? \n\n  Let me check with the example: \n      Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n  Steps (as per example):\n      Shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (1 second: from 3 to 2)\n      Close all the tabs to the left (so now the tabs are 2,3,4,5,6? Actually, wait: the example says: \"shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n  Actually, after shifting to 2, we close the left (from 1 to 1, since the current left boundary is 1 and we are at 2) so we remove tab1. Then the tabs are 2,3,4,5,6. Then we move from 2 to 3 (1 second), then 3 to 4 (1 second). Then we close the right: from 5 to 6 (since we are at 4, and the right boundary is 6). \n\n  Why did they not just close the right from the initial position? Because initially, the cursor was at 3. From 3, if we close the right, we close from 4 to 6. Then we are left with 1,2,3. Then we still have to close the left (tab1). \n\n  Alternatively, from the initial position 3, we could first close the left? But to close the left we must be at l (which is 2). So we have to move to 2 to close the left. Then we have to move to 4 to close the right.\n\n  So the total steps: \n      Move from 3 to 2: 1 step (left)\n      Close left: 1 second (operation)\n      Move from 2 to 4: 2 steps (right, right)\n      Close right: 1 second (operation)\n\n      Total: 1 (move) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n  Alternatively, if we close the right first from 3: \n      We are at 3, we can close the right (from 4 to 6) -> then we are left with 1,2,3. Then we must close the left (from 1 to 1) but to do that we must be at 2. \n          Move from 3 to 2: 1 step (left)\n          Close left: 1 second.\n\n      Total: 0 (initial) + 1 (close right) + 1 (move) + 1 (close left) = 3? \n\n  But wait, the example input is \"6 3 2 4\", and the expected output is 5. Why is the alternative not 3? \n\n  Let me read the example again: \n      \"In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n  The example does not mention the alternative. But note: the example says \"she wants to leave only the tabs with indices from l to r inclusive\", so [2,4]. \n\n  In the alternative I described above: \n      Step 1: Close the right from 3: then we have tabs [1,2,3]. \n      Then we have to close the left: we need to close tab1. To do that, we must be at tab2 (because if we are at 3, then closing the left would close from 1 to 2, which removes 2 as well). So we must move to 2 and then close the left.\n\n      Steps:\n        Operation 1: Close right (from 4 to 6) -> 1 second (operation)\n        Operation 2: Move from 3 to 2 -> 1 second (movement)\n        Operation 3: Close left (from 1 to 1) -> 1 second (operation)\n\n      Total 3 seconds.\n\n  Why does the example say 5? \n\n  Wait, the example input is \"6 3 2 4\", and the example output is 5. \n\n  But according to the problem statement, the example is:\n\n      Input: ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n      Output: ['5', '1', '0']\n\n  So the first example is 5, the second is 1, and the third is 0.\n\n  Why is the first example 5 and not 3?\n\n  Let me check the example operations again:\n\n      \"shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n  This sequence gives 5 seconds.\n\n  But the problem says \"minimum number of seconds\". So why is 3 not acceptable?\n\n  I see: the example says \"In the first test Luba can do the following operations: ...\". It doesn't say it's the minimal.\n\n  However, the example output is 5, so there must be a reason.\n\n  Let me simulate the alternative (closing right first) in the example:\n\n      Initially: tabs 1..6, cursor at 3.\n\n      Step 1: Close the right (from 4 to 6). Now the tabs are [1,2,3] and the cursor is still at 3. The boundaries become a=1, b=3.\n\n      Now, to close the left (from 1 to 1) we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (which is 2). But our cursor is at 3, which is >=2. However, the operation for closing the left requires that we close from a to i-1. Here a=1, i=3 -> we would close from 1 to 2, which removes tab2 as well. But we need to leave [2,3] (which is [l, r] = [2,4] intersected with the remaining tabs [1,2,3] is [2,3])? Actually, wait: the desired segment is [2,4]. But we have closed the right part, so the remaining tabs are [1,2,3]. Now we need to leave [2,4] but 4 is already closed. So we must remove 1. But the operation \"close the left\" from 3 would remove [1,2] (because the current left boundary is 1 and the cursor is at 3). This removes 1 and 2, leaving only 3. But we need [2,3] (because the desired segment is [2,4] and we only have [1,2,3] and we are leaving [2,4] meaning we must leave 2 and 3 and 4? But 4 is already gone. \n\n  Actually, the problem says: we must leave only the tabs from l to r. After closing the right, the set of tabs is [1,2,3] and we must leave [2,4]. But 4 is not present. So we must leave [2,3] (the intersection of [1,2,3] and [2,4]). \n\n  So the desired set is [2,3]. Therefore, we must also remove 1. But the operation from 3: \n      Close left: removes [a, i-1] = [1,2] -> leaves [3]. \n\n  But we wanted to leave [2,3]. So we cannot use the operation from 3 to remove only 1.\n\n  Therefore, to remove only 1, we must be at 2. \n\n  So the alternative is:\n\n      Step 1: Close the right (from 4 to 6) -> 1 second (operation). Now the tabs are [1,2,3] and the boundaries are [1,3].\n      Step 2: Move from 3 to 2 (left): 1 second (movement). Now cursor is at 2.\n      Step 3: Close the left (from 1 to 1): 1 second (operation). Now the tabs are [2,3].\n\n      Total: 3 seconds.\n\n  But wait, the example says 5. \n\n  There's a contradiction.\n\n  Let me check the example again: the example input is \"6 3 2 4\", meaning n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n  In the example, the desired segment is [2,4]. \n\n  After Step 1 (closing the right from 3): \n        Tabs: [1,2,3] (because we closed [4,5,6])\n        But the desired segment is [2,4]. Since 4 is closed and we have 1,2,3, we must remove 1 and keep 2,3. \n\n  So the example's alternative (closing the right first) should be valid and takes 3 seconds.\n\n  However, the sample output is 5.\n\n  I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\n  Rereading the problem statement: \n      \"each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b))\"\n\n  Note: a and b are the minimum and maximum index of the unclosed tabs.\n\n  Initially, a=1, b=6.\n\n  After closing the right (from 4 to 6), the unclosed tabs are [1,2,3] so a=1, b=3.\n\n  Then, when moving from 3 to 2: \n        At tab 3, the next left move: max(3-1, a)=max(2,1)=2 -> valid.\n        Then at tab 2, the next left move: max(2-1,1)=1 -> but we don't want to go below the desired segment? Actually, we are only concerned with the boundaries of the remaining tabs.\n\n  Then, the closure operation for the left from tab2: \n        Close all tabs to the left of 2: that is from a=1 to 1 (because the current unclosed tabs are [1,2,3]) -> removes 1.\n\n  This leaves [2,3] which is the desired segment [2,4] (since 4 is already gone and we don't care about 5,6).\n\n  So the alternative is 3 seconds.\n\n  But the sample output is 5.\n\n  What is happening?\n\n  Let me check the example provided in the problem: \n      Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n  And: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n  Why is the first example 5 and not 3?\n\n  I must have misread the problem's closure operation.\n\n  The problem says: \n      \"close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]\"\n\n  Note: [a, i-1] for the left closure. \n\n  In the alternative approach:\n\n      Step 1: Close the right from 3: \n          Operation: close all the tabs to the right: [i+1, b] = [4,6]. \n          Then the tabs are [1,2,3] and the boundaries become a=1, b=3.\n\n      Step 2: Move from 3 to 2: 1 second.\n      Step 3: Close the left from 2: \n          Operation: close all the tabs to the left: [a, i-1] = [1,1] (since a=1 and i=2, so [1,1]).\n\n      This is valid and takes 3 seconds.\n\n  But wait, the example output is 5. \n\n  Let me check the official example explanation:\n\n      \"shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n      Steps:\n        Move from 3 to 2: 1 second.\n        Close left: 1 second. (Now tabs are [2,3,4,5,6]? No, wait: initially, the left closure from 2 would close [1,1] (if the current left boundary is 1). Then the tabs are [2,3,4,5,6] and boundaries become a=2, b=6.\n        Then move from 2 to 3: 1 second.\n        Then move from 3 to 4: 1 second.\n        Then close the right: from 5 to 6: 1 second.\n\n        Total: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n\n      But why did they not close the left from 3? \n\n      Actually, if we are at 3, the left closure would close [a,2] (because a is 1) -> [1,2]. That would remove 1 and 2, which is not desired.\n\n      Therefore, the example's method is forced because if we close the left from 3, we accidentally remove 2. So we must be at 2 to close the left without affecting 2.\n\n  But wait, the desired segment is [2,4]. So we must leave 2 and 4. \n\n  In the alternative method (closing the right first):\n\n      Step 1: Close the right from 3: removes [4,5,6]. Then the set is [1,2,3]. Now, we must remove 1. To remove 1 without affecting 2, we must close the left from 2. \n\n      However, the closure operation at 2: \n          Close left: [a,1] (a is the current left boundary, which is 1) -> [1,1] -> removes 1.\n\n      This is valid.\n\n  Why then is the example output 5? \n\n  There must be an additional constraint: the problem says that after closing, we must have the tabs from l to r. \n\n  In the alternative method, after closing the right, the set is [1,2,3]. Then we remove 1, leaving [2,3]. This is the desired segment [2,4] (since 4 is already gone and we don't have to worry about numbers beyond 3). \n\n  So the answer should be 3.\n\n  But the sample output is 5.\n\n  I suspect the problem intended that the closure operations cannot be done arbitrarily: we can only close the left if the left boundary is <= the cursor position and similarly for the right. But more importantly, the problem states that the closure operation is defined as:\n\n      - Close all the tabs to the left: from a to i-1.\n      - Close all the tabs to the right: from i+1 to b.\n\n  And note that after a closure, the boundaries a and b update to the new minimum and maximum of the unclosed tabs.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the problem does not allow closing a tab that is within [l, r]! \n\n  But wait, the example: \n        Input: \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n  This means: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n  We need to leave [1,3]. \n\n  We can do: \n        Operation: close the right (from 4 to 6) -> 1 second.\n\n  Then we are done. \n\n  But note: the desired segment is [1,3]. We are closing the right, and the left is untouched. The left is [1,3] (we didn't close any left) and the right [4,6] is closed. \n\n  So the problem does allow to leave the left as is.\n\n  Now, let's consider the first example: \n        n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n  After closing the right (from 4 to 6), we have [1,2,3]. Now, we must remove 1. But the desired segment is [2,4]. However, 4 is already gone. So we must remove 1. \n\n  But wait, the problem says \"leave only the tabs from l to r\". After closing the right, the set is [1,2,3]. We need to leave only [2,4]. But 4 is gone, so we must leave [2,3]. \n\n  However, the operation for the left closure from 2 will remove 1, and then the set is [2,3]. That is [2,3] which is contained in [2,4] (because 3<=4) and we don't have any other tab. \n\n  So why isn't 3 seconds acceptable?\n\n  Let me read the problem statement again: \n      \"What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\"\n\n  The key is: we must leave only the tabs from l to r. \n\n  In the alternative method, we have removed 1 and 4,5,6. The remaining tabs are [2,3] which is a subset of [2,4] (because 2 and 3 are in [2,4]). \n\n  But the problem says \"only\", meaning we cannot have any extra tab. \n\n  However, [2,3] is a subset of [2,4] but is not the entire [2,4]. We are missing 4. \n\n  But wait, we closed the right part (which included 4) in the first operation. \n\n  So the set is [2,3] which is not [2,4]. \n\n  Therefore, the alternative method does not work because it leaves out the tab 4? \n\n  But we closed the right part, which removed 4,5,6. Then we close the left part, which removed 1. Then we have [2,3]. \n\n  The desired set is [2,4]. \n\n  We have removed 4 as well? \n\n  Actually, no: the operation for closing the right from 3 (when the entire set is [1,2,3,4,5,6]) removes [4,6]. Then we are left with [1,2,3]. Then we remove 1 from [1,2,3] by closing the left from 2, leaving [2,3]. \n\n  But the desired set is [2,4]. We don't have 4. \n\n  So the problem: we must leave the tabs from l to r, meaning we cannot remove any tab within [l, r] (in this case [2,4]). \n\n  The alternative method removed 4 (by closing the right) and then removed 1, but that's okay because 4 is outside [2,4] and 1 is outside [2,4]. However, the remaining tabs are [2,3] which is not the entire [2,4] (we are missing 4). \n\n  But wait, we closed the right part (which included 4) and that's fine because 4 is not in [2,4]? \n\n  Actually, the desired segment is [2,4]. We are allowed to have only [2,4] or a subset? \n\n  The problem says: \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\". \n\n  \"Only\" means we cannot have any tab outside [l, r]. But we can have a proper subset? \n\n  The example says: \"leave only the tabs from l to r\", which typically means we must have every tab in [l, r] and no others. \n\n  But in the alternative method, we have [2,3] which is a subset of [2,4] but not the entire set. \n\n  However, the problem does not say that we must have all the tabs in [l, r]. It says \"leave only the tabs from l to r\", meaning that the set of tabs must be a subset of [l, r] and we cannot have any tab outside [l, r]. \n\n  But then having a proper subset is acceptable? \n\n  Let me check the example: \n      Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n  In the example's method, they leave [2,3,4] (after the last closure) but wait, they close the right from 4: \n        They close the right from 4: [5,6] -> so 4 remains. Then the final set is [2,3,4] (if they started with [2,3,4,5,6] and then removed [5,6]). \n\n  But in the alternative method, after closing the right first, we removed 4 as well. \n\n  Ah! That's the issue: \n\n      When we close the right from 3 (initially), the operation is: close all tabs to the right of 3, which is from 4 to 6. \n\n      But note: the problem's operation for the right is defined as: from i+1 to b. \n\n      Initially, i=3, so we close from 4 to 6. \n\n      Then, the set is [1,2,3]. \n\n      But the desired segment is [2,4]. We have removed 4. \n\n      So the alternative method is invalid because it removed 4 (which is in [2,4]).\n\n  Therefore, we cannot close the right part until the cursor is at r (which is 4) so that the closure operation for the right only closes from 5 to 6 (if any) and not including 4.\n\n  Similarly, for the left, we must be at l (which is 2) to close the left without affecting 2.\n\n  Therefore, the only valid way is:\n\n      We must be at 2 to close the left (removing 1) and at 4 to close the right (removing 5,6). \n\n      But note: initially, we are at 3. \n\n      Steps:\n\n        Option 1: \n            Move from 3 to 2: 1 second.\n            Close left: 1 second -> now tabs are [2,3,4,5,6] (wait, no: initially, after closing left, the tabs are [2,3,4,5,6] but the boundaries change to a=2, b=6. But note: we haven't closed the right yet.\n\n        Then, we must move from 2 to 4: 2 seconds (because from 2->3->4).\n        Close right: 1 second.\n\n        Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        Option 2:\n            Move from 3 to 4: 1 second.\n            Close right: 1 second -> now tabs are [1,2,3,4] (because initially, closing the right from 4 removes [5,6]), boundaries become a=1, b=4.\n            Then move from 4 to 2: 2 seconds (4->3->2)\n            Close left: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        Option 3: \n            Move from 3 to 4 (1 sec), then to 2 (via 3) -> that's 3 seconds of movement, then two operations: \n                After moving to 2, we close left (1 sec) -> but wait, after closing the right first, the set is [1,2,3,4] and then we are at 2, so we can close the left (from 1 to 1) without affecting 2. \n                Then total: 1 (to 4) + 1 (operation) + 2 (to 2) + 1 (operation) = 5.\n\n        Option 4: \n            Move from 3 to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec) -> now set is [2,3,4,5,6] (but wait, the left closure from 2 should remove [a,1] and a=1, so yes) -> then move from 2 to 4 (2 sec), close right (1 sec) -> 5.\n\n        Option 5: \n            Move from 3 to 4 (1 sec), close right (1 sec) -> set is [1,2,3,4], then move from 4 to 2 (2 sec), close left (1 sec) -> 5.\n\n        Option 6: \n            Can we do it without moving to the boundaries? \n\n            But we must be at 2 to close the left and at 4 to close the right.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal is 5.\n\n  Now, what about the second example: \"6 3 1 3\"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and calculating the minimal movements required to reach the necessary positions for closing the left and right parts of the segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to close all tabs not within the segment [l, r]. The cursor starts at a given position `pos` in a browser with `n` tabs. The key observation is that to close the left part (tabs 1 to l-1), the cursor must be at position `l`, and to close the right part (tabs r+1 to n), the cursor must be at position `r`. \n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal time is derived by considering two scenarios:\n   - **Scenario 1**: Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` first, then to `r`.\n   - **Scenario 2**: Move the cursor from `pos` to `r` first, then to `l`.\n   The total time for each scenario is the sum of the movement steps between these positions plus one second for each closure operation (left and right).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the Manhattan distances between the initial position and the target positions `l` and `r` in both possible orders (left-first or right-first). The minimal time is the minimum of the two scenarios plus the two closure operations (if applicable).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in constant time O(1) since it involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient even for the upper constraint of `n = 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == r_val and l_val == pos:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n    \n    ans = min(option1, option2)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] is a single tab and the cursor is already on it, no operations are needed (output 0).\n2. **Scenario Calculation**:\n   - **Option 1**: Calculate the time to move from `pos` to `l` and then to `r`. The total time includes the movement steps (absolute differences) plus 2 seconds for the two closure operations.\n   - **Option 2**: Similarly, calculate the time to move from `pos` to `r` and then to `l`.\n3. **Result**: The answer is the minimum of the two scenarios, printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging simple arithmetic and comparisons, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
