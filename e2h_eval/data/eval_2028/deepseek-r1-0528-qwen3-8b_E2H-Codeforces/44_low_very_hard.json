He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers (problem difficulties).\n\n Conditions:\n   - We have to split the list of n problems into exactly k contiguous segments (each segment is consecutive from the start, meaning we cannot change the order).\n   - Each day must have at least one problem.\n\n The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty in that day's segment.\n The total profit is the sum of the profits for each day.\n\n We want to maximize the total profit.\n\n Observation:\n   Since the problems are contiguous and we must cover the entire array, we are effectively choosing k-1 split points.\n\n   Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit we can get by considering the first i problems and distributing them over j days.\n\n   However, note: n, k up to 2000 -> O(n*k) is acceptable (4e6 states). But what would be the recurrence?\n\n   Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n   In the example: [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], k=3 -> [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2] -> profit 5+6+9=20.\n\n   How do we assign days? Note that the last day must end with the last element. Also, the profit for a day is the maximum in that segment.\n\n   Important: The entire array is fixed. The splits must be such that the segments are contiguous.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming:\n\n   Let dp[j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems (we'll iterate i from 0 to n) and j days.\n\n   But we need to know the state for the last segment. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems distributed over j days, and let last[i][j] be the maximum value in the last segment (the j-th day) for the first i problems.\n\n   Then, to compute dp[i][j], we consider the last segment (the j-th day) which ends at position i (so the segment goes from some index x to i). Then:\n\n      dp[i][j] = max_{x from j-1 to i-1} { dp[x-1][j-1] + max(a[x..i]) }\n\n   But note: the segment must be contiguous and we cannot skip any problem.\n\n   However, the condition that the segments are contiguous and we are going from left to right: the j-th day must cover from (x) to (i) (with x being the start of the j-th day, and the previous day ended at x-1).\n\n   Also, the condition that the j-th day must be at least one problem: x <= i.\n\n   But the constraint is that we have j-1 days covering the first x-1 problems.\n\n   So, we have:\n\n      dp[i][j] = max_{x from j-1 to i} { dp[x-1][j-1] + max_segment_value(x, i) }   [if x==0 then dp[-1] doesn't exist, so we must handle base case]\n\n   Base case: dp[i][1] = max(a[0:i+1]) * i   -> Wait, no: for the first day, we take the entire segment from 0 to i, and the profit is the max in that segment. But wait, actually the first day covers from 0 to i, but we are building from left to right. Actually, if we use the above recurrence for j=1:\n\n      dp[i][1] = max_{x from 0 to i} { dp[x-1][0] + ... } -> but we don't have j=0.\n\n   Instead, we can define dp[0][0] = 0, and then for j=1, we set:\n\n      For i from 0 to n-1 (0-indexed), we have:\n\n        dp[i][1] = max_{x from 0 to i} { (max from x to i) } but note: we break the array at x-1 and then the segment from x to i. But for j=1, we are taking the whole array from 0 to i, so we should not break. Actually, we can define:\n\n        Let's use 0-indexed and let dp[i][j] be the maximum profit for the first i+1 problems (i.e., indices 0..i) with j days.\n\n        Then for j=1: dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i])   [but wait, if we take the entire segment, the profit is the max of that segment. However, note: the day's profit is the maximum in that segment. But we are going to break the array arbitrarily. However, the first day must",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving problems over exactly `k` days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The challenge is to split the list of `n` problems into `k` contiguous segments such that the sum of the maximum difficulties of each segment is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` (0-indexed) and `j` ranges from 1 to `k`. The value `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit achievable by splitting the first `i+1` problems into `j` days.\n2. **Base Case**: For the first day (`j=1`), the profit is simply the maximum difficulty in the segment from the start to the current problem.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each subsequent day (`j > 1`), we consider all possible segments ending at the current problem. The profit for the current segment is the maximum difficulty within that segment, and we add it to the best profit achievable from the previous `j-1` days up to the start of the current segment.\n4. **Efficiency**: To efficiently compute the maximum values in segments, we precompute a helper array `max_val[i][j]` which stores the maximum value from index `i` to `j` (inclusive). This allows us to quickly access segment maxima during the DP transition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        print(sum(a))\n        print(n)\n        return\n\n    dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]\n    max_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(a[i], max_val[i+1][j])\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            dp[i][0] = 0\n        else:\n            dp[i][0] = -1\n    \n    for j in range(1, k):\n        for i in range(j-1, n):\n            cur_max = max_val[j-1][i]\n            dp[i][j] = cur_max + dp[j-2][j-1]\n            for x in range(j, i+1):\n                seg_max = max_val[x][i]\n                prev_profit = dp[x-1][j-1] if x-1 >= 0 else (0 if x == 0 else -1)\n                if prev_profit < 0 and x == 0:\n                    continue\n                total_profit = prev_profit + seg_max\n                if total_profit > dp[i][j]:\n                    dp[i][j] = total_profit\n\n    total_profit = dp[n-1][k-1]\n    print(total_profit)\n    \n    splits = [0] * k\n    idx = n-1\n    day = k-1\n    while day > 0:\n        start_index = None\n        temp = -1\n        for x in range(day-1, idx+1):\n            seg_max = max_val[x][idx]\n            prev_profit = dp[x-1][day-2] if x-1 >= 0 else (0 if x == 0 else -1)\n            if prev_profit < 0 and x == 0:\n                continue\n            if prev_profit + seg_max == dp[idx][day]:\n                start_index = x\n                break\n        splits[day-1] = idx - start_index + 1\n        idx = start_index - 1\n        day -= 1\n        \n    if k == n:\n        splits = [1] * k\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, splits)))\n        return\n        \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, splits)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input is read and parsed. If only one day is required, the total sum of all problem difficulties is printed since the entire list must be solved in one day.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_val` array is built to store the maximum value between any two indices, allowing quick lookup during the DP phase.\n3. **DP Table Construction**: The DP table is filled by considering each problem and each possible day count. For each position and day count, the algorithm checks all possible segments ending at that position to determine the optimal split.\n4. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, the solution backtracks from the last problem to determine the exact segments (splits) that achieve the maximum profit. The number of problems per day is derived from these segments.\n5. **Output**: The maximum profit and the corresponding problem distribution per day are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal solution using dynamic programming and careful backtracking, ensuring both correctness and performance within the problem constraints.",
