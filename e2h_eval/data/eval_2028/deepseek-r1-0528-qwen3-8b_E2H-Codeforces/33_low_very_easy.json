You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits, but each digit from s can be used only once.\n The idea: We want to maximize the number. We can think greedily: we want to replace a digit in a position with as large an effect as possible.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the number a is given as a string (without leading zeros) and the sequence s is given as a string of digits.\n\n 2. We can use each element in s at most once, so we have a multiset of available digits.\n\n 3. However, note: we cannot change the order of the digits, we can only replace some of them.\n\n 4. The strategy:\n    - We want to try to replace some digits in a to make the number larger. But we must consider the positions: \n        replacing a digit in a higher place (more significant) has more impact.\n\n 5. We can do:\n    - We are allowed to not use all the replacements. So we choose which ones to use.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We are going to traverse the digits of a from left to right (most significant first).\n    - For each position, we consider: if we replace the current digit with a larger one from the available s, then the entire number becomes larger.\n\n 7. However, we have a limited multiset of digits from s.\n\n 8. Alternate approach:\n    - We can precompute the frequency of each digit in s.\n    - Then, for each position in a (from left to right), we try to find the largest digit in s that is greater than the current digit and hasn't been used too many times (but note: we can use each occurrence only once). However, if we use one, then it's removed.\n\n 9. But wait: we don't need to use all the available digits. We just need to use the best ones.\n\n 10. However, we must also consider: sometimes we might want to save a big digit for a later position? Actually, no: because the leftmost digit is the most important. We should use the best available digit for the current position if it is beneficial, and then move on.\n\n 11. But note: what if we have multiple same digits? We can use a greedy matching from left to right:\n\n    Let available = sorted list of digits in s? Or maybe we keep counts.\n\n    Steps:\n        Let count = [0]*10   # for digits 0-9\n        For each char in s: count[int(char)] += 1\n\n        Then, traverse the string a (as list of characters) from left to right:\n            For the current digit d (as character), we try to find the largest digit x (from '9' down to str(d+1)) such that count[x] > 0.\n            If we find one, then we replace the current digit with x, and decrement count[x] by 1.\n\n        But wait: is this optimal? Consider: \n            Example: a = \"123\", s = \"987\"\n            We start at first digit '1': we can replace with '9', then a becomes \"923\". Then the rest of the digits are already bigger than the next ones? Actually, we don't need to check the rest because we are going to process the entire string.\n\n        However, what if we have two replacements? Example: a = \"123\", s = \"99\". Then we can replace the first digit with '9', then the second digit with '9'. But the above method would use one '9' for the first and then for the second, it would see '2' and then look for a digit greater than '2' and find '9' again.\n\n        This seems to work.\n\n 12. But consider: what if we have two same digits and we can use both? Yes, because we have two '9's.\n\n 13. However, there's a catch: what if we don't replace a digit because there is no available digit greater than it? Then we leave it as is.\n\n 14. But wait: what if we have a digit that is not the maximum, but we can use a replacement that doesn't harm? Actually, we are only replacing when the replacement digit is strictly greater. But note: we are allowed to not use a replacement. And if we don't replace, then we keep the digit. So the above greedy replacement (only replacing by a larger digit) is correct.\n\n 15. However, consider: what if we have a digit that is not replaced, but then a later digit has a very good replacement? The greedy left-to-right replacement is still safe because the leftmost digit is more significant.\n\n 16. But note: sometimes we might want to use a replacement that is not the maximum available for the current position if we can get an even better digit",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing some of its digits with digits from a provided sequence, while adhering to the constraint that each digit in the sequence can be used at most once. The key insight is that the leftmost digits have the highest impact on the number's value, so we should prioritize replacing these digits with larger digits from the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Frequency Count**: First, we count the occurrences of each digit in the provided sequence. This helps in efficiently checking how many times a particular digit is available for replacement.\n2. **Greedy Replacement**: We process the digits of the original number from left to right. For each digit, we look for the largest digit available in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If such a digit is found, we replace the current digit with it and decrement the count of that digit in the sequence. This ensures that we always use the best possible replacement for the most significant digits first, maximizing the number's value.\n3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently processes each digit in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes (up to 10^5 digits).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    for char in s_str:\n        count[int(char)] += 1\n        \n    digits = list(a_str)\n    \n    for i in range(len(digits)):\n        current_digit = int(digits[i])\n        found = False\n        for candidate in range(current_digit + 1, 10):\n            if count.get(candidate, 0) > 0:\n                digits[i] = str(candidate)\n                count[candidate] -= 1\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n    result = ''.join(digits)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the original number and the sequence of digits from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Count**: It initializes a dictionary to keep track of how many times each digit appears in the sequence.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, it checks for the largest digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If found, it replaces the current digit with this larger digit and updates the count of the used digit.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all digits, the modified number is printed, which represents the maximum value achievable under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that the most significant digits are replaced first with the largest possible digits from the sequence, leading to the highest possible number value efficiently.",
