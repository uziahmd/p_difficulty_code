For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (with sharps). Note: The problem says there are 12 notes and they are repeated cyclically.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   [Note: In some systems, B is called B and H might be B? But the problem states: notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. \n        However, in the example input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] and the note H is included. Also note that the example says \"after H goes C\".\n\n 2. The problem says the distance from C to E is 4 semitones, but from E to C is 8 semitones (because going up from E to C is 3->4->5->6->7->8 semitones? Actually, wait: \n    The circle has 12 semitones. So from E (which is 4) to C (0): \n        Going up: from E to F: 1, F to F#: 2, F# to G: 3, G to G#: 4, G# to A: 5, A to A#: 6 (but we don't have A#), wait no, let's list the notes in order:\n\n    We have 12 notes: \n        0: C, 1: C#, 2: D, 3: D#, 4: E, 5: F, 6: F#, 7: G, 8: G#, 9: A, 10: B, 11: H.\n\n    Actually, wait: the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And after H comes C. \n\n    But note: the example says the chord \"C# B F\" is minor when ordered as \"B C# F\". \n    Let's map:\n        B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n\n    Now, we have to consider the circularity. The distance between two notes is the minimum of the clockwise and counterclockwise steps? But the problem says:\n\n    \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\"\n\n    This implies that the distance is always taken from the lowest tone to the highest one? But wait, the example says \"between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning if we start at E and go to C, we go up 8 semitones (which is the long way around). \n\n    However, for defining the chord, we need to check for an ordering of the three notes such that:\n        For major: there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n            distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones (meaning the next note is 4 above X)\n            distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones (meaning the next note is 3 above Y)\n\n        But note: the entire chord spans 7 semitones (from X to Z is 7). However, because of the circle, we might have to consider the notes modulo 12.\n\n    How to compute the distance from note a to note b?\n        Let a_num and b_num be the numbers (0-11) for the two notes.\n        We can define the distance as (b_num - a_num) mod 12, but then we want the smallest positive distance? However, the problem does not use the smallest distance for the chord definition.\n\n    Important: The chord definition uses the linear ordering from the lowest to the highest. But the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 (not the minimal 4 going the other way). \n\n    Actually, the chord definition requires that the three notes are consecutive in the circle? Not exactly: the chord is defined by two intervals: 4 and 3 semitones, so the entire chord is 7 semitones. \n\n    However, the chord is an unordered set. We must check all permutations? There are 3! = 6 permutations, but we can also consider the circular shifts.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n    This ordering is linear. However, the musical scale is circular. But the definition specifies: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\".\n\n    So we must arrange the three notes in increasing order (lowest to highest) and then check the intervals?\n\n    However, note: the example \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: B, C#, F -> but wait, in the circle: \n          B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\n        How to arrange in increasing order? We have to account for the circularity. But the problem says \"distance from the lowest to the uppest\", meaning we can break the circle?\n\n    Actually, we can flatten the circle by duplicating the octave? But the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. \n\n    Alternate approach: \n        We can consider the three notes and then arrange them in a linear sequence that covers at most 12 semitones (so we don't wrap more than once). \n\n    However, note: the chord definition does not require the entire set to be within one octave? Actually, the chord is defined by two intervals: 4 and 3, which together make 7. So the entire chord is contained in an interval of 7 semitones. \n\n    Steps for checking:\n\n    Let the three notes be n1, n2, n3 (as numbers from 0 to 11).\n\n    We need to check if there exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n        (b - a) mod 12 = 4   OR   (b - a) mod 12 = 8? Wait, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, but that was for going from a higher note to a lower one? \n\n    Let me read the problem again: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n    This implies that we are moving upwards. So the note Y must be 4 semitones above X, and Z must be 3 semitones above Y. \n\n    But wait, in the example \"C E G\": \n        C -> E: 4 semitones (so E is above C by 4)\n        E -> G: 3 semitones (so G is above E by 3)\n\n    Now, if we take the same notes in a different order, say starting with E: \n        E -> G: 3, then from G to C: how much? \n        From G (7) to C (0): we can go up: 7->8->9->10->11->0 (which is 5 steps: 8,9,10,11,0 -> but wait, the note after G is G# (8) and then A(9), A#(10) but we don't have A# in our set, then B(10) and then C(0) is 11-7=4? Actually, we have to count the semitones:\n\n        The distance from G to C (going up): \n            G to G#: 1, G# to A: 2, A to A#: 3 (but we don't have A#), then what? Actually, the next note after A is B (which is 10) and then H (11) and then C (0). So from G (7) to C (0) is 4 semitones? No, wait: \n            G (7) -> G# (8): +1\n            G# (8) -> A (9): +1 -> total 2\n            A (9) -> B (10): +1 -> total 3\n            B (10) -> H (11): +1 -> total 4\n            H (11) -> C (0): +1 (since 12 mod 12 is 0) -> total 5.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. How do we compute that?\n\n        The problem states: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\"\n\n        This suggests that the distance from E to C is measured by going up from E (4) to F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8) -> so 4 steps: E->F:1, F->F#:2, F#->G:3, G->G#:4 -> but wait, then from E to G# is 4 semitones? Then from E to C would be from E to G# (4) then to A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8) -> so 8 semitones.\n\n        So the rule: the distance from note a to note b is defined as the number of semitones you have to go up from a to reach b, and if b is below a in the current octave, then we wrap around to the next octave.\n\n        In other words, the distance from a to b is ((b - a) mod 12) but if (b - a) mod 12 is negative, we add 12? Actually, the problem says \"from the lowest to the uppest\", so we are only considering the upward direction.\n\n        Therefore, the distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >= a, but if b < a, then (b - a + 12) mod 12? Actually, the distance from E (4) to C (0) is (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8, which matches.\n\n        So we define the distance from note a (number a) to note b (number b) as: (b - a) % 12, but if negative, we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, we can do: \n            distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n            But wait: (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (in Python, negative modulus gives a positive result). \n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n            (-4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals: 4 and 3. \n\n        For a major chord: we require two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3, meaning the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones. \n\n        But note: the entire chord must be contained in an interval of 7 semitones? Actually, the chord is defined by the two intervals, so the third note is 7 semitones above the first.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 and between Y and Z equals 3\", meaning that the entire set of three notes must be arranged in an increasing sequence (without wrapping) such that the second note is 4 above the first, and the third is 3 above the second. \n\n        But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n            They are ordered as \"B C# F\". \n            B (10) to C# (1): \n                (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 % 12 = 3 -> so the distance from B to C# is 3 (if we go up from B: B->H->C->C#? That doesn't sound right). \n\n        Alternatively, we must consider the entire circle. The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n        How do we determine the lowest and the highest? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify whether the chord is considered in one octave or multiple. However, note that the chord has three distinct notes (since it's a set). \n\n        We must consider the circular arrangement. The chord is defined by two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3, so the entire chord spans 7 semitones. \n\n        But the example \"C# B F\" is given as minor. \n\n        Let me map the example \"C# B F\": \n            B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n\n        Now, we have to arrange these three notes in a linear sequence without crossing the octave boundary more than necessary? Actually, we can break the circle.\n\n        The problem says: the distance from the lowest to the highest. So we should arrange the three notes in ascending order (considering the circle, but we break at the octave boundary). \n\n        However, note: the example says the ordering is \"B C# F\". But in the circle, B is 10, then C# is 1 (which is the next octave). So the distance from B to C# is 1 (in the next octave) minus 10, which is 1 - 10 = -9, then add 12 -> 3. \n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. So the definition of distance is: \n            distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12   [if negative, adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, modulus already gives a positive number between 0 and 11]\n\n        However, the chord definition requires that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3, but note that the entire chord must be contiguous in the circle? \n\n        Another way: we can consider the three notes and then look for a root note (X) and then the next note (Y) is 4 above, and then the next (Z) is 3 above Y (so 7 above X). \n\n        But the circle has 12, so we must consider two possibilities for each note as the root? \n\n        Actually, the problem says \"unordered set\", so we can try each note as the starting point and then check the two following notes.\n\n        Steps for checking major/minor:\n\n        Let the three notes (as numbers) be a, b, c.\n\n        We'll consider all rotations (three starting points) and for each starting point, we'll consider two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) but the definition requires the distances to be 4 and then 3 (so the next note must be 4 above, then 3 above that). \n\n        However, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So we must ensure that the three notes are in increasing order (without wrapping) for the entire chord? \n\n        But note: the example \"C# B F\" is given as minor, and the ordering is \"B C# F\", which is increasing in the circle if we consider that after B comes C# (because 10 < 1+12). \n\n        So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the input string to three numbers.\n\n        Step 2: Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n        Step 3: For each permutation (x, y, z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12   [this gives the upward distance from x to y, wrapping if necessary]\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n            But wait, the problem requires that the entire set is arranged from lowest to highest. However, the circle might break the natural order. \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the entire circle and check if the three notes form a sequence of intervals 4 and 3 (in that order) in the clockwise direction, or in the counterclockwise? \n\n        But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, and we are allowed to order arbitrarily. However, the ordering must be such that the distances are increasing (from low to high). \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n        This means that we are considering the linear arrangement without wrapping? But then how do we compare the notes? \n\n        Example: \"C E G\": \n            Notes: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n            If we arrange in increasing order: 0,4,7 -> then the intervals are 4 and 3 -> major.\n\n        Example: \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: B=10, C#=1, F=5.\n            Now, if we arrange in increasing order without wrapping: 10,1,5 -> but 1 is less than 10? Actually, we break the circle: we can consider the circle and then take the segment that contains all three notes and then order them. \n\n        However, the problem says \"from the lowest to the uppest\", so we must find the absolute lowest note and then go up. \n\n        But note: the example \"C# B F\" is given as minor. The ordering provided is \"B C# F\", meaning they are ordering starting from B (which is 10) and then going to C# (1) and then to F (5). \n\n        How is that ordering from lowest to highest? In the circle, the note B (10) is followed by H (11) and then C (0). But wait, the problem says the distance from B to C# is 3, meaning from B to C# is 3 semitones. \n\n        But in the circle, the next note after B is H (11) and then C (0) and then C# (1). So from B to C#: \n            B to H: 1 semitone (distance 1)\n            H to C: 1 semitone (distance 2, cumulative 2)\n            C to C#: 1 semitone (distance 3, cumulative 3)\n\n        So the entire distance from B to C# is 3. \n\n        Now, the ordering from lowest to highest: \n            The three notes are B (10), C# (1), F (5). \n            Without wrapping, the usual increasing order (numerically) would be [1,5,10] -> but that would be C#, F, B. \n            However, the problem says the chord is minor and the ordering is \"B C# F\", which is not the numerical increasing order. \n\n        What's the catch? The problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that the entire chord must be considered in a single octave? Or we are allowed to wrap? \n\n        Actually, the chord is defined by two intervals: 4 and 3, so the entire chord spans 7 semitones. \n\n        In the example \"C# B F\": \n            We have three notes: 10, 1, 5. \n            The entire span from the lowest to the highest (if we don't wrap) is from 1 to 10, which is 9 semitones. But wait, the chord definition requires 7 semitones? \n\n        Let me re-read: \n            For major: the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3, so the entire chord from X to Z is 7. \n            For minor: the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4, so the entire chord from X to Z is 7.\n\n        So the entire chord must be contained within a span of 7 semitones? \n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\" has the notes: \n            If we take the root as B (10), then the next note is C# (1): 3 semitones, and then the next note is F (5): from C# (1) to F (5) is 4 semitones. \n            But wait, from B (10) to F (5): \n                (5 - 10) % 12 = -5 % 12 = 7 -> so the entire chord from B to F is 7 semitones. \n\n        So the condition is that the entire chord (from the root to the last note) is 7 semitones. \n\n        How to check:\n\n        We can consider each note as the root, and then check the two other notes to see if they form the pattern.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let the three notes (as numbers) be a, b, c.\n\n        For each root in [a, b, c]:\n            Let the other two notes be the remaining two.\n\n            We consider two possibilities for the chord: \n                Possibility 1: The chord is major -> the next note should be 4 semitones above the root, and the next note 3 semitones above the second note (so 7 above the root).\n                Possibility 2: The chord is minor -> the next note should be 3 semitones above the root, and the next note 4 semitones above the second note (so 7 above the root).\n\n            But note: the chord must be entirely contained in the 7 semitone span. However, because the circle is 12, we can also consider the complement (going down) but the definition says upward.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we are only going upward.\n\n            But wait: the example \"C# B F\" uses the root B (10). Then the next note is C# (1). The distance from B to C# is (1-10) % 12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3, which is correct for minor.\n\n            Then the next note is F (5). The distance from C# to F is (5-1)%12 = 4, which is correct.\n\n            But note: the entire chord from B to F is 7 semitones: (5-10) %12 = (5-10+12)%12 = 7.\n\n            So the condition is: the entire chord must be 7 semitones from the root to the last note? \n\n            However, the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals: 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n            So we don't necessarily require that the entire chord is 7 semitones from the root to the last note? Actually, the entire chord from root to last note is 7, but we are breaking it into two parts: 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor). \n\n            But note: the problem says the set {X, Y, Z} must be ordered so that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3 (for major). \n\n            This implies that the entire chord from X to Z is 7, and the two intervals are adjacent.\n\n            Therefore, we can check:\n\n            For a candidate root (x), we require that the other two notes (y, z) must be exactly (x + 4) mod 12 and (x + 7) mod 12? \n\n            But wait, the chord is defined by two consecutive intervals, so the last note must be x+4+3 = x+7. \n\n            However, note: the chord might be in a different octave? \n\n            Example: root = C (0), then the major chord is C (0), E (4), G (7). \n            root = C, then the notes are 0,4,7.\n\n            Example: root = E (4), then the major chord would be E (4), G (7), and then the next note would be (4+7)=11, which is H. So the chord E, G, H is major? \n            But wait, the intervals: \n                E to G: (7-4)%12=3 -> that's not 4. \n\n            Let me clarify: the chord is defined by the two intervals: \n                For major: first interval is 4, then 3. So the entire chord is built by:\n                    X, then X+4, then X+7.\n\n            Similarly, minor: X, then X+3, then X+7.\n\n            So the three notes must be {x, (x+4)%12, (x+7)%12} for major, and {x, (x+3)%12, (x+7)%12} for minor.\n\n            However, wait: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. \n                Let x = B (10). \n                Then the minor chord would be: \n                    x = 10, then x+3 = 13 %12 = 1 (C#), then x+7 = 17 %12 = 5 (F). \n                So the set is {10, 1, 5}. \n\n            This matches.\n\n            But what about the example \"C E G\": \n                Let x = C (0). \n                Major: {0, 4, 7} -> {C, E, G}. Correct.\n\n            However, note: the chord is an unordered set. So we don't care about the order, but the set must be exactly {x, x+4, x+7} (mod 12) for major, or {x, x+3, x+7} (mod 12) for minor.\n\n            But wait: what if the root is not the lowest note? \n\n            Example: major chord C E G. \n                We can also consider E (4) as the root? Then the chord would be {4, (4+4)%12=8, (4+7)%12=11} -> {E, G#, H}. That is a different chord.\n\n            Similarly, G (7) as the root: {7, (7+4)%12=11, (7+7)%12=14%12=2} -> {G, H, D}. \n\n            So each chord has one root that makes the entire set {x, x+4, x+7} (mod12) or {x, x+3, x+7} (mod12). \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n            For each note as the root (x):\n                Let set1 = {x, (x+4)%12, (x+7)%12}\n                Let set2 = {x, (x+3)%12, (x+7)%12}\n\n            Then, if the given set (of three numbers) equals set1, then it's major (if we haven't found a minor, but wait: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so there won't be a chord that is both).\n\n            Similarly, if the given set equals set2, then it's minor.\n\n            However, what if the set matches both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n            But wait: could a set be both? \n                Set1 = {x, x+4, x+7}\n                Set2 = {x, x+3, x+7}\n\n                These sets are the same only if {x+4, x+3} is the same as {x+3, x+4} and we have the same set? But we have three distinct notes. However, if 4 == 3 mod12? No, 4 != 3.\n\n                But note: the set {x, x+3, x+7} and {x, x+4, x+7} are different unless 3==4 mod12, which is not.\n\n            However, wait: the set must contain three distinct notes. And 3,4,7 are distinct modulo 12.\n\n            But there's a catch: the set must be exactly the three notes. \n\n            Example: if we have the set {0, 3, 7} and {0,4,7} are different.\n\n            So algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input string to three numbers (list `notes`).\n\n            Step 2: Create a set of the three numbers.\n\n            Step 3: For each note in the three as candidate root (x):\n                Check if the set equals {x, (x+4)%12, (x+7)%12} -> then output \"major\"\n                Else, check if the set equals {x, (x+3)%12, (x+7)%12} -> then output \"minor\"\n\n            But wait: what if the set matches for one root as major and for another root as minor? \n\n            Example: Consider the chord {0,4,7} (C E G). \n                Candidate root 0: \n                    major: {0,4,7} -> matches -> output major.\n\n                Candidate root 4: \n                    major: {4,8,11} -> does not match {0,4,7}\n                    minor: {4,7,11} -> does not match.\n\n                Candidate root 7:\n                    major: {7,11,2} -> {7,11,2} which is {0,2,7}? No, wait: 2 is D, 7 is G, 11 is H -> set {7,11,2} is {2,7,11} which is not {0,4,7}.\n                    minor: {7,10,2} -> {2,7,10} -> not.\n\n            So the chord is only identified by one root.\n\n            However, what if the same chord can be interpreted by two different roots? \n\n            Example: Let's take a different chord. Suppose we have the chord {0,3,7}. \n                Candidate root 0: \n                    major: {0,4,7} -> no\n                    minor: {0,3,7} -> yes -> minor.\n\n                Candidate root 3:\n                    major: {3,7,10} -> no\n                    minor: {3,6,10} -> no\n\n                Candidate root 7:\n                    major: {7,11,2} -> no\n                    minor: {7,10,2} -> no\n\n            Now, is there a chord that is both major and minor? According to the problem, no.\n\n            But wait, what if we have a set that matches two different roots? \n\n            Example: Consider the chord {0,4,7} (major). \n                Candidate root 0: matches major.\n                Candidate root 4: doesn't match.\n                Candidate root 7: doesn't match.\n\n            Now, consider the chord {0,3,7}: minor.\n\n            But what if we have a set that matches two different patterns? \n\n            Example: Let the set be {0,3,7}. We found it as minor when root=0. Is there any other root that would make it major? \n                For root 0: major requires {0,4,7} -> no.\n                For root 3: major requires {3,7,10} -> no.\n                For root 7: major requires {7,11,2} -> no.\n\n            So it's safe.\n\n            However, note: the set must be exactly the three notes. \n\n            But what if the set has duplicates? The problem says the chord is an unordered set of three distinct notes.\n\n            Implementation:\n\n            Let mapping = {\n                'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11\n            }\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Read the input line, split, then convert each note to a number.\n\n            Let s = set of the three numbers.\n\n            For each candidate root in the three numbers:\n                Let set_major = {candidate, (candidate+4)%12, (candidate+7)%12}\n                Let set_minor = {candidate, (candidate+3)%12, (candidate+7)%12}\n\n                If s == set_major:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit or break out of the loop.\n\n                If s == set_minor:\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit or break.\n\n            If none matches, then print(\"strange\")\n\n            However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n            But wait: what if the set matches both set_major and set_minor for different roots? \n\n            Example: Consider a set {0,4,7}. \n                Candidate root 0: \n                    set_major = {0,4,7} -> matches -> output \"major\".\n                We don't check the others.\n\n            Example: Consider the set {0,3,7}. \n                Candidate root 0: \n                    set_major = {0,4,7} -> no.\n                    set_minor = {0,3,7} -> yes -> output \"minor\".\n\n            Example: Consider a set that is neither? \n                Candidate root x: none of the set_major or set_minor matches -> then we move to the next candidate root.\n\n            Example: Consider the set {0,1,2}. \n                Candidate root 0: \n                    set_major = {0,4,7} -> no.\n                    set_minor = {0,3,7} -> no.\n                Candidate root 1:\n                    set_major = {1,5,8} -> no.\n                    set_minor = {1,4,8} -> no.\n                Candidate root 2:\n                    set_major = {2,6,9} -> no.\n                    set_minor = {2,5,9} -> no.\n\n            Then we output \"strange\".\n\n            But wait: what if the same set can be matched by two different roots but with different patterns? \n\n            Example: Consider the set {0,4,7}. \n                We only match it with root 0 as major. \n                What if we consider root 4? \n                    set_major for root4: {4,8,11} -> no.\n                    set_minor for root4: {4,7,11} -> no.\n\n            So we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the set must be exactly the three notes. The set operation is unordered.\n\n            But wait: what if the set is {0,4,7} and we consider root 0: \n                set_major = {0,4, (0+7)%12=7} -> {0,4,7} -> matches.\n\n            What if the set is {0,4,7} but the root is 4? \n                set_major = {4, (4+4)%12=8, (4+7)%12=11} -> {4,8,11} -> not {0,4,7}.\n\n            So we must check the entire set.\n\n            However, note: the set {0,4,7} is the same as {0,7,4}. \n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            data = input().split()\n            # There should be three notes.\n\n            # Convert each note to number\n            try:\n                nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n            except KeyError:\n                # According to the problem, the notes are from the given set, so this shouldn't happen.\n                print(\"strange\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            s = set(nums)\n\n            for x in nums:\n                set_maj = {x, (x+4)%12, (x+7)%12}\n                set_min = {x, (x+3)%12, (x+7)%12}\n\n                if s == set_maj:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)\n                if s == set_min:\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n            Let's test with examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7] -> set_maj for 0: {0,4,7} -> matches -> prints \"major\".\n\n            Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking the intervals between the notes based on their positions in the chromatic scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) representing its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Checking Chord Types**: For each note in the input set, consider it as the root note. Then, check if the other two notes match the intervals required for a major or minor chord:\n   - **Major Chord**: The intervals should be 4 semitones from the root to the first note and 3 semitones from the first note to the second note (totaling 7 semitones from the root).\n   - **Minor Chord**: The intervals should be 3 semitones from the root to the first note and 4 semitones from the first note to the second note (totaling 7 semitones from the root).\n3. **Set Comparison**: The set of the three input notes must exactly match the set formed by the root note and the two derived notes for either chord type.\n4. **Output Result**: If the set matches a major chord configuration, output \"major\". If it matches a minor chord configuration, output \"minor\". If neither, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmapping = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    try:\n        nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n\n    s = set(nums)\n    \n    for x in nums:\n        set_maj = {x, (x + 4) % 12, (x + 7) % 12}\n        set_min = {x, (x + 3) % 12, (x + 7) % 12}\n        \n        if s == set_maj:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if s == set_min:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique number from 0 to 11, facilitating interval calculations.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding numbers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Set Creation**: The set `s` is created from the three input numbers to allow easy comparison with the chord configurations.\n4. **Chord Check**: For each note in the input set, the code checks if the other two notes form a major or minor chord by verifying if they match the expected intervals (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 semitones for minor) when the current note is considered the root.\n5. **Result Determination**: If the set of input notes matches any major or minor chord configuration, the corresponding result is printed. If no match is found after checking all possible roots, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible chord configurations by leveraging set operations and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.",
