For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes, but we don't know the order. We have to check if they form a major or minor triad.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (in semitones) relative to C (which is 0).\n    Notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    But wait: the problem says the notes are cyclic and after H comes C. Also, the example includes \"C# B F\" and orders it as \"B C# F\".\n\n    Let's assign numbers from 0 to 11:\n\n        C = 0\n        C# = 1\n        D = 2\n        D# = 3\n        E = 4\n        F = 5\n        F# = 6\n        G = 7\n        G# = 8\n        A = 9\n        B = 10\n        H = 11\n\n    However, note that in the example \"C E G\": \n        C -> 0, E -> 4, G -> 7.\n        The intervals: 4-0 = 4, 7-4=3 -> major.\n\n    But what about the example \"C# B F\"? \n        We need to map: \n            C# -> 1, B -> 10, F -> 5.\n        Then we must consider the cyclic nature. Since the chord is unordered, we can arrange the notes in increasing order (with wrap-around?).\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from C to E is 4, but from E to C is 8 (because going from E to C: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: 8 semitones). \n\n    So we have to consider the circle. The distance between two notes is defined as the smallest positive difference along the circle? Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", and then \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n    But note the example: the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. This implies that we are not taking the minimal circular distance, but the forward distance? However, the definition for the chord ordering requires that we can order the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). \n\n    Important: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n    How do we interpret the ordering? The entire set of notes is repeated cyclically, so we can consider the notes modulo 12. But the ordering must be such that we go from the lowest to the highest, and if we cross the octave boundary, we might have to adjust.\n\n    However, note: the example \"C# B F\" is ordered as \"B C# F\". Let's see:\n\n        In the circle: \n            B is at 10, then next is C (0) then C# (1), then D (2)... until F (5). \n        But wait, the example orders as \"B C# F\": \n            From B to C#: \n                B (10) to C (0) is 2 semitones? But wait, the example says 3 semitones. \n\n        Actually, the example says: between B and C# is 3 semitones. But from B to C# we can go: \n            B -> C (1 step) and then C to C# (another step) -> total 2 steps? That would be 2 semitones.\n\n        Let me reexamine: \n            The example says: \"the triplet 'C# B F' is minor, because if we order the notes as 'B C# F', than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.\"\n\n        Wait, let's map the notes in the example: \n            B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n\n        Now, the ordering they use is B, then C#, then F.\n\n        How do we compute the distance from B to C#?\n            If we consider the circle, we can go from B (10) to C (0) then to C# (1). The distance from B to C# in the forward direction (without wrapping) is (1 - 10) mod 12? That doesn't make sense.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the circle as having 12 notes. The",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves mapping each note to its corresponding semitone value, checking all possible orderings of the notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad, and then outputting the appropriate result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Semitones**: Each note is mapped to a number between 0 and 11, representing its position in the 12-note chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Checking All Orderings**: For the three notes, generate all permutations (orderings) to check if any ordering satisfies the conditions for a major or minor triad.\n   - **Major Triad**: The first two notes must be 4 semitones apart, and the next two notes must be 3 semitones apart (totaling 7 semitones from the first to the third note).\n   - **Minor Triad**: The first two notes must be 3 semitones apart, and the next two notes must be 4 semitones apart (totaling 7 semitones from the first to the third note).\n3. **Cycle Handling**: Since the musical scale is cyclic, the distance between two notes should be computed as the smallest difference in either direction (modulo 12). However, the problem specifies that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest tone, so we adjust the distances accordingly by considering the circular nature of the scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    note_to_semitone = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    semitones = [note_to_semitone[note] for note in notes]\n    n = len(semitones)\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            for k in range(n):\n                if i == j or i == k or j == k:\n                    continue\n                a, b, c = semitones[i], semitones[j], semitones[k]\n                \n                def get_distance(x, y):\n                    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                    d2 = (x - y) % 12\n                    return d1 if d1 <= d2 else d2\n                    \n                dist_ab = get_distance(a, b)\n                dist_bc = get_distance(b, c)\n                dist_ac = (dist_ab + dist_bc) % 12\n                \n                if dist_ab == 4 and dist_bc == 3 and dist_ac == 7:\n                    found_major = True\n                elif dist_ab == 3 and dist_bc == 4 and dist_ac == 7:\n                    found_minor = True\n                    \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_semitone` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding semitone value (0-11). This allows us to convert each input note into a numerical value for easier comparison.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the smallest distance between two notes on the circular scale (considering both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions).\n3. **Triad Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three input notes to see if any permutation forms a major or minor triad. A major triad requires a 4-semitone interval followed by a 3-semitone interval, while a minor triad requires a 3-semitone interval followed by a 4-semitone interval.\n4. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the code prints \"major\" if only a major triad is found, \"minor\" if only a minor triad is found, and \"strange\" if neither is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to determine the type of triad, leveraging the cyclic nature of the musical scale to handle all edge cases.",
