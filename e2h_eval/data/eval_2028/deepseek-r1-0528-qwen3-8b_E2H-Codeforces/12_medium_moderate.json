The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that we process the tasks in order.\n\n The challenge: Since the ring is circular, moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered house requires going around the circle? Actually, note:\n\n The ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house x, you can only move to house x+1 (mod n, but note: after n comes 1). However, the numbering is 1 to n.\n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Explanation: \n   Start at 1.\n   Then go from 1 to 2 to 3 (this is for the first task at 3) -> 2 moves so far.\n   Then from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2 to 3 (for the second task at 2 and third task at 3) -> that's 4 more moves? \n   But wait: the example says 6 total.\n\n However, note that the example sequence is: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1, then:\n      Move from 1 to 2: 1 step\n      Move from 2 to 3: 2nd step (task 1 done at 3)\n\n      Then from 3 to 4: 3rd step\n      Then from 4 to 1: 4th step\n      Then from 1 to 2: 5th step\n      Then from 2 to 3: 6th step (task 2 and 3 done)\n\n But note: the problem states that the second task is at house 2 and the third at house 3.\n\n However, the condition is that when doing the i-th task, she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So the second task (at house 2) must be done after the first (at 3). \n\n But wait, how can she do the second task (house 2) after the first (house 3)? Because the ring is circular and one-way, she must go from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2 (which is 3 steps from 3 to 2). \n\n However, the example output is 6.\n\n We can break down the journey:\n\n   From start (house 1) to first task (house 3): \n        If we consider the ring: \n          Option 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 (distance 2)\n          Option 2: 1 -> ... but clockwise only, so the other way would be longer.\n\n   Then from house 3 to house 2 (second task): \n        In clockwise direction, to get from 3 to 2, we must go: 3->4->1->2 (distance 3)\n\n   Then from house 2 to house 3 (third task): \n        From 2 to 3: clockwise: 2->3 (distance 1)\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can also consider that after completing the first task at 3, the next task is at 2. Since the ring is circular, we can compute the distance from the current house to the next task by considering two directions? But note: the movement is only clockwise.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we cannot go counterclockwise. Therefore, we must always move forward (increasing numbers, and after n goes to 1).\n\n Therefore, the movement from a house x to a house y (with x and y between 1 and n) is:\n\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) because we can just go from x to x+1 to ... to y.\n\n   But if x > y: then we have to go from x to x+1, ... until n, then 1, then 2, ... until y. \n        This is (n - x + y) because from x to n: (n - x) steps, then from 1 to y: (y - 1) steps, so total (n - x + 1 + y - 1) = n - x + y.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the clockwise distance from x to y as:\n        d = (y - x) % n   [but this modulus doesn't work for negative and we want positive steps]\n\n Actually, we can define:\n\n        If we are at x and want to go to y, then the distance is:\n            if y >= x: steps = y - x\n            else: steps = n - x + y\n\n But note: the example from 3 to 2: \n        x=3, y=2 -> since 2 < 3, then steps = 4 - 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3? Actually, 4-3+2 = 3, which matches.\n\n Alternatively, we can use modulo arithmetic:\n\n        Let d = (y - x) % n, but if negative then add n? Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let d = (y - x) % n\n        But if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so (y-x)%n would be (y-x+n) % n, which is positive. However, we don't want the modulus to give the minimal circular distance in both directions. We only want clockwise.\n\n        Actually, we don't need modulus for the entire circle, because the problem is fixed: we only move clockwise.\n\n        We can define: \n            distance(x, y) = (y - x) if y >= x, else (n - x + y)\n\n        But note: the example from 2 to 3: (3>=2) -> 1, correct.\n\n        Example from 3 to 2: (2<3) -> 4-3+2 = 3.\n\n        Example from 1 to 1: 0.\n\n        Example from 1 to 4: 4-1=3, correct.\n\n        Example from 4 to 1: (1<4) -> 4-4+1 = 1, correct.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to go from the last task to the start necessarily, but the entire journey is from house 1 to the tasks and then stops at the last task.\n\n But the problem says: initially at house 1, and then the tasks. We must account for the entire path.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that we must return to the start, so we only need to account for the time from house 1 to the first task, then from the first task to the second, etc.\n\n Therefore, the total time is the sum of the distances from the starting point (current house) to the next task.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Start at house 1.\n\n   Then for each task i (from 0 to m-1):\n\n        Let current_house = the starting point for the first task is 1, then after the first task we are at a1, then for the second task we are at a2, etc.\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to not be at the task house until we arrive. So the time to complete the first task is the distance from 1 to a1.\n\n        Then the time to complete the second task is the distance from a1 to a2.\n\n        Then from a2 to a3, etc.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", and then she has m things to do. The tasks are given in order.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        for each task in the list:\n            d = distance(current, task)\n            total_time += d\n            current = task\n\n   But note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n   Let me check with the second example:\n\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Start at 1.\n\n            First task: 2 -> distance from 1 to 2: since 2>=1 -> 2-1 = 1. Then current becomes 2.\n\n            Second task: 3 -> distance from 2 to 3: 3-2=1. Then current becomes 3.\n\n            Third task: 3 -> distance from 3 to 3: 0.\n\n            Total_time = 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n        That matches the example.\n\n   However, wait: what if there are consecutive same tasks? Then we don't move.\n\n   But note: the example \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives 6.\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        First task: 3 -> distance from 1 to 3: 3-1=2. current=3.\n\n        Second task: 2 -> distance from 3 to 2: n=4, 2<3 -> 4-3+2 = 3. current=2.\n\n        Third task: 3 -> distance from 2 to 3: 3-2=1.\n\n        Total_time = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n   So the function for distance is:\n\n        def distance(x, y, n):\n            if y >= x:\n                return y - x\n            else:\n                return n - x + y\n\n   But note: the problem constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we can do a simple loop.\n\n   However, let's consider performance: m up to 10^5, so we are doing 10^5 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: is there a smarter way? Maybe by precomputing the positions or using prefix sums? \n\n   Actually, note that the journey is broken into segments from the current task location to the next.\n\n   However, we are simply traversing the list of tasks and computing the distance between consecutive tasks (and the initial from 1 to the first task).\n\n   This is O(m) and m can be 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\n   Code:\n\n        Read n and m\n        Read the list of tasks (m integers)\n\n        total = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        for each task in the list:\n            if task >= current:\n                total += (task - current)\n            else:\n                total += (n - current + task)\n            current = task\n\n        Print(total)\n\n   However, wait: what if n is very large? The calculation is straightforward and uses integer arithmetic.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n            current=1\n            task=3: 3>=1 -> total += (3-1)=2 -> total=2, current=3.\n            task=2: 2<3 -> total += (4-3+2)=3 -> total=5, current=2.\n            task=3: 3>=2 -> total += (3-2)=1 -> total=6.\n\n        Example 2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n            current=1\n            task=2: 2>=1 -> total += (2-1)=1 -> total=1, current=2.\n            task=3: 3>=2 -> total += (3-2)=1 -> total=2, current=3.\n            task=3: 3>=3 -> total += (3-3)=0 -> total=2.\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is given as two lines. The first line is \"n m\", the second line is m integers.\n\n   We read from stdin.\n\n   Example input:\n\n        \"4 3\"\n        \"3 2 3\"\n\n   We can read:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0]); m = int(data[1])\n        tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n   But note: the problem says the second line contains m integers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read:\n\n        first_line = input().split()\n        n = int(first_line[0]); m = int(first_line[1])\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   However, the input might have multiple lines. The problem says the second line contains m integers.\n\n   But the example input is given as two lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The second line contains m integers\".\n\n   So we can safely read the first line and then the second line.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n   But in the problem statement, the input is two lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, so the second line may be a long string. We can read the second line as a whole and split.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   However, what if there are spaces at the beginning or end? The split() method will take care.\n\n   Let me run with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> output 6.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> output 2.\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input:\n          4 3\n          3 2 3\n\n        Output:\n          6\n\n        Input:\n          4 3\n          2 3 3\n\n        Output:\n          2\n\n   However, the example input provided in the problem is two separate examples. Our program should handle one test case per run.\n\n   Since the problem reads from stdin, we assume one test case.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the tasks are given. We are processing one test case.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total = 0\n\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total += t - current\n            else:\n                total += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives 6, which is correct.\n\n   But let me test with another edge case: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n\n        current=1\n        t=1: 1>=1 -> total += 0, current=1 -> output 0.\n\n   Another: n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> total += 1, current=2.\n        Second task: 1 -> 1<2 -> total += 2-2+1 = 1 -> total=2.\n\n        But wait: from house 2 to house 1 in a ring of 2: \n            clockwise: 2->1 (since after 2 comes 1) -> 1 step.\n\n        So total=1 (first task) + 1 (second task) = 2.\n\n   Another: n=2, m=3, tasks=[1,2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 1 -> 0, current=1.\n        Second task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> 1, current=2.\n        Third task: 1 -> 1<2 -> 2-2+1=1, total=0+1+1=2.\n\n   It seems correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so from 2 the next house is 1 (if n=2). So the above is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have n=10, and tasks [10, 1, 2, ..., 9]?\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 10 -> 10>=1 -> 9, current=10.\n        Task2: 1 -> 1<10 -> n-10+1 = 10-10+1 = 1, current=1.\n        Task3: 2 -> 2>=1 -> 1, current=2.\n\n        Total = 9+1+1 = 11.\n\n   How about the actual path?\n\n        From 1 to 10: 9 steps (1->2->3->...->10)\n        Then from 10 to 1: 1 step (10->1)\n        Then from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n\n        Total: 9+1+1 = 11.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total += t - current\n            else:\n                total += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 to n. The modulus effect is handled by our if-else.\n\n   But wait: is there a possibility of negative numbers? No, because n>=2 and tasks are between 1 and n.\n\n   This should be efficient for n, m up to 10^5.\n\n   Let me submit this code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++\", but we are in Python, so no problem.\n\n   We are using integers and the operations are basic arithmetic.\n\n   However, note that the total could be large (up to 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is within the range of Python integers, but we should use integer arithmetic).\n\n   But the problem says to use cin, cout or %I64d in C++. In Python, we just print an integer.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   One more thing: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", so we start at 1.\n\n   We are setting current=1 and then processing the tasks.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as two examples. But our program reads one test case.\n\n   Since competitive programming problems usually have one test case per run, we assume one test case.\n\n   But if the problem had multiple test cases, we would need to adjust. However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   According to the problem statement: \n        The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains m integers.\n\n   So one test case.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total += t - current\n            else:\n                total += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: there's a potential issue. What if the task list is empty? m=0. Then the for loop doesn't run and we output 0. That's correct.\n\n   The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, the constraint says m>=1, so yes.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Let me submit.\n\n   But wait, I see that the problem says: \"Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\"\n\n   Our code handles that because if two consecutive tasks are the same, then the else branch (if t==current) would be taken as the same and then the distance is 0.\n\n   Example: [1,1] for n=2: \n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 1 -> 0, current=1.\n        Second task: 1 -> 0, total=0.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   However, let me run through a slightly larger example.\n\n        n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 5 -> 5>=1 -> 4, current=5.\n        Task2: 4 -> 4<5 -> 5-5+4 = 4, current=4.\n        Task3: 3 -> 3<4 -> 5-4+3=4, current=3.\n        Task4: 2 -> 2<3 -> 5-3+2=4, current=2.\n        Task5: 1 -> 1<2 -> 5-2+1=4, current=1.\n\n        Total = 4+4+4+4+4 = 20.\n\n        Actual path:\n\n            1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps (to first task)\n            5->1->2->3->4: 4 steps (to second task)\n            4->5->1->2->3: 4 steps (to third task) -> wait, but from 4 to 3: \n                Actually, from 4: clockwise: 4->5->1->2->3 -> that's 4 steps? \n                But wait: from 4 to 3: \n                    In a ring of 5: \n                        4->5 (step1), 5->1 (step2), 1->2 (step3), 2->3 (step4): yes, 4 steps.\n\n            Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->5->1->2: 4 steps? \n                Actually, from 3: \n                    3->4 (step1), 4->5 (step2), 5->1 (step3), 1->2 (step4): 4 steps.\n\n            Then from 2 to 1: 2->3->4->5->1: 4 steps.\n\n            Total 4+4+4+4+4=20.\n\n        But wait, the first task is at 5, then the next task is at 4. The direct clockwise from 5 to 4: \n            5->1->2->3->4: 4 steps, yes.\n\n        So the calculation is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   However, note that the above example can be optimized by not having to traverse the entire circle for each task? But the problem doesn't require optimization beyond the linear scan.\n\n   But wait: the problem says n and m up to 10^5, and we are doing a linear scan so it's O(m). The arithmetic operations are constant time.\n\n   So the solution is efficient.\n\n   We'll output the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad with houses numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. For each task, she needs to be at the specified house, having completed all previous tasks. The key observation is that movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, so the distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions:\n   - If the target house is ahead (greater than or equal to the current house), the distance is simply the difference between the target and current houses.\n   - If the target house is behind (less than the current house), the distance is computed by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house n) and then continuing from the start (house 1) to the target house.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating through each task in sequence, calculating the distance from the current position to the next task's house using the above conditions, and accumulating the total time taken. The algorithm efficiently processes each task in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each task. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is optimal for the given constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total_time += t - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + t\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses (n) and tasks (m), followed by the list of tasks.\n- **Processing Tasks**: Starting from house 1, the code iterates over each task. For each task, it calculates the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house. If the task's house is ahead, the distance is straightforward (task house minus current house). If it's behind, the distance is computed by wrapping around the ring (n - current house + task house).\n- **Accumulating Time**: The calculated distances are summed up to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n- **Output**: The total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations to compute distances in a clockwise-only path, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
