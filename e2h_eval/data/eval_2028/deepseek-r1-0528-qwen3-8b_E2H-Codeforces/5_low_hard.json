Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form the maximum number of pairs (one left and one right) such that the colors are compatible.\n\n Conditions for compatibility:\n  - Two specific colors (non '?') must be equal.\n  - An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color.\n\n However, note: a boot can be used at most once.\n\n We have two types of boots: \n   Left: represented by string `l`\n   Right: represented by string `r`\n\n We cannot pair a '?' with a specific letter if we don't have to? Actually, we can: because '?' is compatible with any.\n\n But note: the problem requires maximum pairs. We might use some '?' as wildcards and then use the specific ones.\n\n However, note that sometimes we might have to decide which pairs to form. The challenge is that there are many '?' and they can match multiple possibilities.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the total number of pairs we can form is at most n (since we have n left and n right). We want the maximum.\n\n 2. We can break down the problem:\n\n   Let's define:\n      Let L = list of left boots, each has an index and a color.\n      Let R = list of right boots, each has an index and a color.\n\n   We want to form as many pairs as possible.\n\n 3. We can consider two kinds of matches:\n\n   a) Matches between two specific letters (non '?'): we require that the two letters are the same.\n\n   b) Matches involving at least one '?': \n        - '?' in left and any right (including specific or '?')\n        - '?' in right and any left\n        - two '?'s: which is also allowed.\n\n 4. However, note: if we use a '?' from left, we can match it with any right (including a '?' in right). Similarly for a '?' in right.\n\n 5. How to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n   We can use a greedy strategy, but note: the problem size is up to 150000.\n\n   We cannot try all possibilities because of the constraints.\n\n 6. Alternate approach:\n\n   We can separate the boots into two sets:\n\n     Left set: \n        Let A = list of indices for left boots that are not '?'\n        Let B = list of indices for left boots that are '?'\n\n     Right set:\n        Let C = list of indices for right boots that are not '?'\n        Let D = list of indices for right boots that are '?'\n\n   Then, we can first form pairs between the non '?' boots that are matching.\n\n   But note: sometimes a '?' can be used to match a specific letter that isn't matched otherwise, and vice versa.\n\n   However, we cannot simply do:\n\n     Step 1: Match non '?' left boots with non '?' right boots that have the same letter.\n     Step 2: Then use the remaining '?' to match the remaining specific ones, and then match the leftover '?' among themselves.\n\n   Why? Because a '?' can match a specific letter, so we might have to leave some specific letters unmatched if they don't have a matching specific letter, but we can use a '?' to cover them.\n\n   Actually, the maximum pairs we can form is limited by the total number of boots (n) and the constraints of matching.\n\n   We can think of:\n\n     Let x = number of pairs formed by two non '?' boots (same letter)\n     Let y = number of pairs formed by one non '?' and one '?' (the '?' can be either side, but note: if we use a '?' from left, then the right must be non '?' or vice versa, but actually the '?' can be on either side)\n\n     However, note: we have two sets of '?' (left and right). We can use a '?' from left to match a non '?' from right, or a non '?' from left and a '?' from right, or two '?'.\n\n   We can also consider:\n\n     Let T = total pairs.\n\n     The total pairs cannot exceed the total available boots (n). Moreover, the pairs must use distinct indices.\n\n 7. We can use a graph matching? But n is up to 150000, and we have two sets (left and right) and edges defined by compatibility. This is a bipartite graph. But the graph has up to 150000 nodes and potentially O(n^2) edges? (because if both are '?', then every left '?' can connect to every right '?') — that would be too slow.\n\n 8. We need an efficient way.\n\n   Observation:\n\n   The compatibility condition is very simple.\n\n   We can split the problem:\n\n   Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter (from 'a' to 'z') in the non '?' left boots and non '?' right boots.\n\n   Then, the maximum pairs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be the same, while an indefinite color '?' can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching two sets of boots (left and right) based on their colors. The key challenge is efficiently handling the '?' characters which can match any color, thus increasing the potential for more pairs.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves categorizing the boots into those with specific colors and those with '?'. We first match the specific colors between left and right boots. Then, we use the '?' boots to match the remaining unmatched boots or among themselves.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each specific color, count how many times it appears in left and right boots. This helps in matching boots of the same color.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: After matching specific colors, use the '?' boots to match any remaining boots. This ensures the maximum number of pairs.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot in linear time, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_non_q = []\n    left_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        lc = l_str[i]\n        rc = r_str[i]\n        if lc != '?':\n            left_non_q.append((i+1, lc))\n        else:\n            left_q.append(i+1)\n            \n        if rc != '?':\n            right_non_q.append((i+1, rc))\n        else:\n            right_q.append(i+1)\n            \n    freq_left = defaultdict(int)\n    for idx, color in left_non_q:\n        freq_left[color] += 1\n        \n    freq_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for idx, color in right_non_q:\n        freq_right[color] += 1\n        \n    matched_non_q = 0\n    non_q_pairs = []\n    \n    for color in freq_left:\n        if color in freq_right:\n            cnt = min(freq_left[color], freq_right[color])\n            matched_non_q += cnt\n            for _ in range(cnt):\n                non_q_pairs.append((color, color))\n                \n    for color in freq_left:\n        if color in freq_right:\n            cnt = min(freq_left[color], freq_right[color])\n            for _ in range(cnt):\n                non_q_pairs.append((color, color))\n            freq_left[color] -= cnt\n            freq_right[color] -= cnt\n            \n    for color in freq_left:\n        if freq_left[color] > 0:\n            matched_non_q += freq_left[color]\n            for _ in range(freq_left[color]):\n                non_q_pairs.append(('?', color))\n            freq_right[color] -= freq_left[color]\n            \n    for color in freq_right:\n        if freq_right[color] > 0:\n            matched_non_q += freq_right[color]\n            for _ in range(freq_right[color]):\n                non_q_pairs.append((color, '?'))\n            freq_left[color] -= freq_right[color]\n            \n    q_matches = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    matched_non_q += q_matches\n    \n    result_pairs = []\n    for color_pair in non_q_pairs:\n        if color_pair == ('?', '?'):\n            continue\n        if color_pair[0] == '?':\n            color_char = color_pair[1]\n            for idx_l, idx_r in zip(left_q, right_q[:q_matches]):\n                result_pairs.append((idx_l, idx_r))\n                break\n        elif color_pair[1] == '?':\n            color_char = color_pair[0]\n            for idx_l, idx_r in zip(left_q[:q_matches], right_q):\n                result_pairs.append((idx_l, idx_r))\n                break\n        else:\n            result_pairs.append(color_pair)\n            \n    for i in range(q_matches, len(left_q)):\n        idx_l = left_q[i]\n        idx_r = right_q[i]\n        result_pairs.append((idx_l, idx_r))\n        \n    print(matched_non_q + q_matches)\n    for pair in result_pairs:\n        if pair[0] == '?':\n            print(f\"{pair[1]} {pair[0]}\")\n        elif pair[1] == '?':\n            print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective colors.\n2. **Categorization**: Boots are categorized into those with specific colors and those with '?'.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: The frequency of each specific color in left and right boots is counted.\n4. **Non '?' Matching**: Boots with specific colors are matched based on color equality. The remaining boots are matched using '?'.\n5. **Result Compilation**: The matched pairs are compiled, ensuring no boot is used more than once. The results are printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging frequency counting and greedy matching, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
