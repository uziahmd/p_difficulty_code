He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one string which is either an integer or 'R' (for Roman numerals).\n Then, the next line is a non-negative integer c in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000) that might be represented as a string.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split it.\n 2. The first token is always an integer `a` (base). The second token can be either an integer `b` or 'R'.\n 3. Read the next line which is the number `c` in base `a`.\n\n We have to convert the given string `c` (which is in base `a`) to base `b`, unless `b` is 'R', then we convert to base `b` which means converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\n However, note that the input number `c` is given in base `a`. So first we need to convert `c` from base `a` to base 10 (integer).\n\n But note: the problem says that the number may contain leading zeros and its length doesn't exceed 1000. Also, if it's Roman numerals, the number is guaranteed to be between 1 and 300010.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n Case 1: If the second token is an integer `b` (so not 'R'):\n   - Convert the string `c` (base `a`) to an integer (base 10). Let this integer be `n`.\n   - Then convert the integer `n` to base `b` (which is an integer between 2 and 25). We must output without leading zeros.\n\n Case 2: If the second token is 'R':\n   - Convert the string `c` (base `a`) to an integer (base 10). Let this integer be `n`.\n   - Then convert the integer `n` (which is at least 1 and at most 300010) to a Roman numeral.\n\n Important: The input base `a` is between 2 and 25, and the representation of `c` in base `a` may use digits 0-9 and then letters for digits above 9 (from 10 to 24) but wait, the problem says \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n However, note: the input `c` is given in base `a` and may contain leading zeros. The digits in base `a` can be from '0' to the digit representing `a-1`. For example, base 16 uses digits '0' to 'F'. But our base `a` is at most 25, so we'll have digits from '0' to the digit representing 24. We can use the standard conversion: map each character to a digit value.\n\n Steps for converting string `c` (base `a`) to integer (base 10):\n\n   n = 0\n   for each char in c:\n        digit_value = int(char) if char in '0123456789' else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n        But wait, what if the base is less than or equal to 10? Then we don't have letters. Actually, the input string `c` should only contain digits (and possibly letters) that are valid for base `a`. The problem says the number is given in base `a` and may contain leading zeros.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total = 0\n        power = 1\n        # Traverse the string from right to left? Or left to right?\n        # But the string is given as is (leftmost is most significant)\n\n        for i in range(len(c)-1, -1, -1):\n            d = c[i]\n            # Map d to a digit value. Since the base is `a`, the digits allowed are from '0' to the digit representing `a-1`.\n            if '0' <= d <= '9':\n                digit_val = ord(d) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit_val = ord(d) - ord('A') + 10\n\n            # But note: if the digit_val is >= a, then it's invalid? However, the problem says \"non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume valid digits.\n\n            total = total * a + digit_val\n\n   However, the problem states that the input string `c` is in base `a` and may contain leading zeros. But note: the length can be up to 1000, so we must be careful with the size of `n`. The problem also says",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this integer to the desired output base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two tokens: the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which can be either an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number `c` represented in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by considering its positional value.\n3. **Decimal to Target Base Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the decimal number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral representation, handling cases like subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    base_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else '2'\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n        \n    if base_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(base_str)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n            \n    n = 0\n    negative = False\n    if num_str.startswith('-'):\n        negative = True\n        num_str = num_str[1:]\n        \n    if not num_str:\n        n = 0\n    else:\n        for char in num_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit_val = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit_val = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                \n            if digit_val >= a:\n                print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                return\n                \n            n = n * a + digit_val\n            \n    if negative:\n        n = -n\n        \n    if b == 'R':\n        if n < 0:\n            print(\"Negative numbers not supported for Roman numerals\")\n            return\n            \n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = {\n            1000: 'M',\n            900: 'CM',\n            500: 'D',\n            400: 'CD',\n            100: 'C',\n            90: 'XC',\n            50: 'L',\n            40: 'XL',\n            10: 'X',\n            9: 'IX',\n            5: 'V',\n            4: 'IV',\n            1: 'I'\n        }\n        res = ''\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals.items():\n            while n >= value:\n                res += symbol\n                n -= value\n        print(res)\n    else:\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        base = b\n        if base < 2 or base > 36:\n            print(\"Base must be between 2 and 36\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        sign = '-' if n < 0 else ''\n        n_abs = abs(n)\n        while n_abs:\n            r = n_abs % base\n            digits.append(r)\n            n_abs //= base\n            \n        if sign:\n            digits.append('-')\n            \n        res = ''\n        for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):\n            if digits[i] == '-':\n                res += '-'\n            else:\n                if digits[i] < 10:\n                    res += str(digits[i])\n                else:\n                    res += chr(ord('A') + digits[i] - 10)\n                    \n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The script reads two lines from standard input. The first line specifies the source and target bases, and the second line provides the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The number string is converted to a decimal integer by processing each character, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value based on its position.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - For integer targets, the decimal number is converted by repeated division by the target base, with remainders collected to form the output digits.\n   - For Roman numerals, the decimal number is converted using a dictionary of Roman numeral values, appending the corresponding symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles negative numbers, invalid inputs, and ensures no leading zeros in the output. Roman numeral conversion only works for positive numbers up to 3000.",
