Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with length n)\n\n Note: the binary representation s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} corresponds to m = s0*2^{n-1} + s1*2^{n-2} + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n However, note that the function f(x) is defined for x in [0, 2^n - 1] but we are only considering x <= m.\n\n The function f(x) = sum_{i: bit(i) is set in x} a_i.\n\n But note: the problem says that the i-th bit in x (for i from 0 to n-1) is considered. However, the array a has indices 0 to n-1, and the function uses the same index as the bit position.\n\n How does the bit indexing work?\n   In the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011). Then the bits set are at positions 0,1,3 (counting from least significant bit? or most?)\n\n Let's clarify the example: \n   Example says: n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary) then f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n How is the binary representation of x related to the array a?\n\n The problem states: \"where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n But note: the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. The binary representation of x has n bits? Actually, the input gives a binary string of length n (without spaces) for m.\n\n However, the problem says: the third line is a sequence of digits (binary representation of m) without spaces.\n\n Important: the representation of m is given as a string of n bits: s0, s1, ..., s_{n-1}. This means:\n\n   m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n And the function f(x) uses the same bit representation? But note: the function f(x) is defined for any integer x (from 0 to 2^n-1). \n\n However, the problem states that the array a has n elements. The i-th element of a (a_i) is used when the i-th bit is set.\n\n But wait: the example uses i=0 for the least significant bit? In the example, x=11 (binary 1011) and the bits set are at positions 0,1,3. \n\n How is the bit numbering done? The problem does not explicitly say, but note:\n\n   In standard computer science, we often consider the least significant bit as the 0th bit (rightmost). However, the representation of m is given as a string of n bits (from the most significant to the least significant).\n\n So, the input string for m is given as a big-endian representation: the first character is the most significant bit (at power 2^(n-1)) and the last is the least significant (at power 2^0).\n\n Now, what is the bit numbering for the function f(x)? The problem says \"the i-th position\" in the binary representation of x. \n\n But note: x can be any integer from 0 to 2^n-1, so it has up to n bits. We have to map the bits of x (which we can represent with n bits) to the array a.\n\n There are two ways to interpret:\n\n Option 1: The i-th bit in the problem's context (for i from 0 to n-1) is the bit corresponding to 2^i. Then the array a is indexed by the exponent i.\n\n However, the example: \n   n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> 2^0, 2^1, 2^3 are set. Then we use a0, a1, a3.\n\n But note: in the example, the array a is given as [3,8,...] for the first sample. Then the maximum is 3 because we can only set the bits that are available in numbers <=20 (which is 101000...? Actually wait, the example input is:\n\n Input:\n     2\n     3 8\n     10\n\n Here n=2, so m is represented by two bits: \"10\" meaning m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n Then we must consider x from 0 to 2 (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums the elements of array \\( a \\) at positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a '1'. The challenge is to determine which bits can be set in \\( x \\) without exceeding the value \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The binary representation of \\( m \\) dictates which bits can be set in \\( x \\). We process each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit position, if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '1', we can potentially set that bit in \\( x \\) and include the corresponding array element in the sum. However, if the bit in \\( m \\) is '0', we must decide whether setting that bit would still keep \\( x \\) within bounds, which depends on the higher bits already processed.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach:\n   - Start from the most significant bit (leftmost) to the least significant bit (rightmost).\n   - For each bit, if it is '1' in \\( m \\), we can include its corresponding array element and proceed.\n   - If the bit is '0', we check if all previous bits were set to their maximum (i.e., '1') because if they were, setting this bit would exceed \\( m \\). Otherwise, we can set this bit and include the corresponding array element, but only if the cumulative value does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits (same as the length of the binary string for \\( m \\)). This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    power = 0\n    base = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            total += a[base]\n            base += 1\n            power = (1 << base)\n        else:\n            if base < len(a):\n                if power >= (1 << base):\n                    total += a[base]\n                    base += 1\n                    power = (1 << base)\n                else:\n                    base += 1\n                    power = (1 << base)\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to accumulate the sum of array elements, `power` to track the current bit's value, and `base` to index the array \\( a \\).\n3. **Processing Bits**: We iterate over the binary string from right to left (least significant to most significant bit). For each bit:\n   - If the bit is '1', we add the corresponding array element to `total` and update `base` and `power`.\n   - If the bit is '0', we check if setting this bit (due to previous bits being '1') would not exceed \\( m \\). If so, we include the array element; otherwise, we simply move to the next bit.\n4. **Output**: The accumulated `total` is printed, which represents the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the optimal combination of bits to maximize \\( f(x) \\) while respecting the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).",
