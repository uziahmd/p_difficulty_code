Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters must be the same (and the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal has the same letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters? Let's read again: \n    - The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n    - Then: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\"\n\n However, note: the example input:\n   Input 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n   Output: NO\n\n Why? Because the center cell (which is part of both diagonals) is 's'. But wait, in the example, the diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, let's break down:\n\n Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter? Or each diagonal can have its own? The problem says \"all letters are the same\" for each diagonal. But note: the center is common. So if we require that the entire main diagonal and the entire anti-diagonal have the same letter, then the center must be that letter. \n\n However, looking at the example: \n   The main diagonal: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not the same! \n   The anti-diagonal: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> same as main? Actually, no: \n        The main diagonal: positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4): \n            row0: 'x', row1: 'o', row2: 's', row3: 'o', row4: 'x'\n        The anti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0): \n            row0: 'x', row1: 'o', row2 's', row3 'o', row4 'x'\n\n But wait, the example output is \"NO\". Why? Because condition 2: all other squares must contain the same letter (different from the diagonal letter). In this example, the diagonals have two different letters? Actually, the example input has an 's' in the center. The other squares are mostly 'o' and 'x'? Actually, the example input:\n\n        x o o o x\n        o x o x o\n        s o x o s   -> wait, the example input says: \"soxoo\", so third row: ['s','o','x','o','o']? \n\n Let me re-type the example:\n\n Example 1 input:\n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n So the grid:\n\n        x o o o x\n        o x o x o\n        s o x o o   # Wait, the third row is \"soxoo\" -> s, o, x, o, o\n        o x o x o\n        x o o o x\n\n Now, the main diagonal: \n        [ (0,0):'x', (1,1):'x' (from second row: \"oxoxo\" -> index1 is 'x'), (2,2):'x', (3,3):'x', (4,4):'x' ] -> actually, wait: second row is \"oxoxo\": \n            index0: 'o', index1: 'x', index2: 'o', index3: 'x', index4: 'o'\n        So (1,1) is 'x', (2,2) is 'x' (from \"soxoo\": index2 is 'x'), (3,3) is 'x' (from \"oxoxo\": index3 is 'x'), (4,4) is 'x'. \n        Therefore, main diagonal is all 'x'.\n\n        Anti-diagonal: \n            (0,4):'x', (1,3):'x', (2,2):'x', (3,1):'x', (4,0):'x' -> all 'x'.\n\n        Now condition 2: all other squares must contain the same letter (say 'o') and different from 'x'.\n\n        Check the grid: \n            First row: 'x','o','o','o','x' -> okay, non-diagonals are 'o'\n            Second row: 'o','x','o','x','o' -> the non-diagonals are 'o' (at",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Letters from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Letters from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n   - Both diagonals must consist of the same letter throughout. This includes the center cell which is common to both diagonals.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**:\n   - All letters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Verify that all diagonal cells contain the same letter.\n   - Ensure all non-diagonal cells contain a different uniform letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_letter = None\n    other_letter = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                if diag_letter is None:\n                    diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != diag_letter:\n                    diag_letter = None\n                    break\n    \n    if diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if other_letter is None:\n                other_letter = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                other_letter = None\n                break\n        if other_letter is None:\n            break\n    \n    if other_letter is None or other_letter == diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It iterates over each cell in the grid. For cells on either the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) or the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`), it checks if all these cells contain the same letter (`diag_letter`). If any cell on these diagonals differs, `diag_letter` is set to `None`, indicating the condition fails.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After verifying the diagonals, the code checks all other cells. These cells must all contain the same letter (`other_letter`) which is different from `diag_letter`. If any cell does not meet this condition, `other_letter` is set to `None`.\n4. **Result Determination**: If both checks pass (diagonals uniform with one letter and non-diagonals uniform with a different letter), the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by systematically checking each cell's role in the diagonals and non-diagonals, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
