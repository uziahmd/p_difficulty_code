Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S (in Morse code).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that the Morse code strings for letters are of length 1 to 4, and there are 30 possible binary strings (with '0' for dot and '1' for dash) of length 1 to 4, but four of them are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n    So, valid codes for letters are the set of all binary strings of length 1 to 4 except those four.\n\n 2. The problem: after each appending of a '0' or '1' to S, count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of letters that can be represented by contiguous substrings of S (each substring being interpreted as a Morse code string). Note: the same Morse string might appear multiple times, but we are counting sequences (which are just the concatenation of letters). However, note: two different Morse strings (for example, \"1\" and \"11\") both represent a letter, and then \"11\" can also be part of \"11\" (as one letter) and also \"1\" and then \"1\" (two letters). But note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". This means we are allowed to break the substring arbitrarily (at any point) as long as each segment is a valid Morse code string (of length 1 to 4). However, note the example: \n\n    Example with S = \"111\": \n        - The entire string \"111\" can be broken as:\n            Option 1: \"111\" -> one letter (O)\n            Option 2: \"1\" and \"11\" -> T and M (so \"TM\")\n            Option 3: \"11\" and \"1\" -> M and T (so \"MT\")\n            Option 4: \"1\", \"1\", \"1\" -> TTT\n\n    But note: the example output counts 7: \n        T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT.\n\n    However, note that the example output says:\n        After 3 appends: 7\n\n    But wait: the example input has 3 modifications and outputs 1, 3, 7.\n\n    Let's break down the example:\n\n        m=3, and the three appends are three '1's.\n\n        Step1: S=\"1\"\n            Substrings: \n                \"1\" -> valid (T)\n            So, we have one sequence: T -> count=1\n\n        Step2: S=\"11\"\n            Substrings of length 1: \"1\" (valid) and \"1\" (valid) [but they are same, but we consider breaking? Actually, we are counting sequences of letters. The entire string \"11\" is one letter (M) and we can also break it into two letters: \"1\" and \"1\" (TT). Also, the substring \"1\" (first one) and \"1\" (second one) are considered separately, but the entire string can be broken in two ways.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"some substring\" of S. But actually, we are allowed to take any contiguous substring and interpret it as a sequence of Morse code strings (each of which must be valid). This is similar to counting the number of ways to parse the entire string (or any contiguous substring) as a sequence of valid Morse codes.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n\n            How do we interpret this?\n\n            We are allowed to take any contiguous substring of S (which is a string of 0s and 1s) and then split that substring into one or more valid Morse code strings (each of length 1 to 4). Then, the entire set of sequences (each sequence being the concatenation of these letters) is counted.\n\n            However, note: the same sequence may be formed from different substrings? Actually, the problem does not specify that we should consider distinct sequences, but the example counts:\n\n            After \"111\": \n                T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT.\n\n            But note: \"TT\" is the same as \"TT\" regardless of how you get it. And \"TM\" and \"MT\" are distinct.\n\n            Important: The problem does not require that the entire substring must be broken in a unique way. We are simply counting every distinct sequence (string of letters) that appears as the concatenation of valid Morse codes from any contiguous substring.\n\n            However, note: the same sequence (like \"TT\") might appear from multiple substrings? For example, in \"111\",",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by contiguous substrings of a given string S, where each letter is encoded in Morse code using binary strings (0 for dot, 1 for dash). The solution involves processing the string incrementally and efficiently tracking valid sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any valid Morse code sequence must be composed of valid binary strings of lengths 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". For each modification to the string S, we need to determine how many new valid sequences can be formed by considering all possible substrings ending at the current position.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position. Specifically, we maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i`. \n\n3. **Transition**: For each new character added to S, we check all possible substring endings (from length 1 to 4) to see if they form a valid Morse code. If valid, we update the DP array accordingly. The total number of valid sequences up to the current position is the sum of all valid sequences ending at or before the current position.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total = 0\n    ans = []\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        char = s_list[i]\n        dp[i+1] = 0\n        \n        for j in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = i - j + 1\n            if start_index < 0:\n                break\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(start_index, i+1))\n            if len(substr) != j:\n                continue\n                \n            if j == 1:\n                if substr != '0':\n                    dp[i+1] += 1\n            elif j == 2:\n                if substr not in ['00', '01', '10', '11']:\n                    dp[i+1] += 1\n            elif j == 3:\n                invalid_3 = ['000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111']\n                if substr not in invalid_3:\n                    dp[i+1] += 1\n            else:  # j == 4\n                invalid_4 = ['0000', '0001', '0010', '0100', '1000', '1100', '0011', '0101', '1001', '1101', '0110', '1010', '1110', '1111']\n                if substr not in invalid_4:\n                    dp[i+1] += 1\n                    \n        total = (total + dp[i+1]) % MOD\n        ans.append(total)\n        \n    for a in ans:\n        print(a)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes necessary variables, including a dynamic programming array `dp` to store counts of valid sequences ending at each position.\n\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string S, the code checks all possible substring lengths (1 to 4) ending at the current position. If the substring is valid (i.e., not one of the excluded codes), it increments the corresponding `dp` value.\n\n3. **Updating Total Valid Sequences**: The total number of valid sequences is updated by summing the values from the `dp` array up to the current position. This total is printed after each modification to S.\n\n4. **Output**: The results are printed line by line, showing the count of valid sequences after each addition to S, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 3000 modifications.",
