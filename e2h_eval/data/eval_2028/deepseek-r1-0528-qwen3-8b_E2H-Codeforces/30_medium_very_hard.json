Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n The game: two players, each making exactly n moves. In each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). Then that digit is erased from A.\n\n We want to assign each of the 2n moves to either Homer or Marge (so n moves for each) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 + the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", meaning the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But note: The assignment of moves to players can be arbitrary as long as each player makes n moves. However, the catch is that the digits are taken in order from left to right.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the entire sequence of 2n digits be d0, d1, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n In the game, the digits are taken in order. Each move, we take the leftmost remaining digit and assign it to one of the players.\n\n So the process is fixed: the digits are removed from left to right, but we decide which player gets which digit (each player must get exactly n digits).\n\n How does the total prize (S1 + S2) break down?\n\n Let the moves be assigned to players. Then:\n   S1 = (digit at position i0) * 10^(n-1-i0) + (digit at position i1) * 10^(n-1-i1) + ... \n   Similarly for S2.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from left to right, so the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant digit of that player's number.\n\n However, the assignment also affects the power of ten for the subsequent digits. For example, if a player gets the first digit, then the next digit they get will be the next most significant (with power 10^(n-2)).\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the entire sequence of 2n digits will be split into two subsequences (each of length n) without changing the order. The total value is:\n\n   S1 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit at the k-th move assigned to S1) * 10^(n-1 - index_in_S1)\n   S2 = similarly.\n\n But note: the index in the original array is decreasing because we remove from the left. However, the assignment of which digit goes to which player matters, and the position (i.e., the time when the digit is taken) determines its significance.\n\n Actually, we can consider: \n   Let the entire sequence be split into two sequences (Homer's and Marge's) of n digits, preserving the original order.\n\n Then, for Homer: his number is the digits he got (in the order he got them) and the first digit he got (the earliest in the sequence) is the most significant.\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n But note: the total value is independent of the interleaving? Actually no, because the same set of digits might be arranged differently if we assign different orders.\n\n However, wait: the assignment must be a way to assign each digit (at a specific position) to one of the players, and the digits are taken from left to right. The catch: the same digit cannot be used by both, and the assignment must be contiguous in the sense that we are just assigning the positions.\n\n Actually, the assignment is: we choose which n positions (from the 2n) go to Homer and which n to Marge. But the positions are fixed: the first digit is the first one, the second is the second, etc.\n\n Then, the value for Homer is: \n   Let H = [h0, h1, ..., h_{n-1}] be the digits Homer got, then S1 = int(''.join(h0, h1, ..., h_{n-1}))\n\n Similarly for Marge.\n\n And we want to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n is up to 18 (so 2n up to 36), we cannot iterate over all combinations (which would be C(36,18) ~ 9e9) and then compute the numbers (which are up to 36-digit numbers) because that would be too slow.\n\n Alternate idea: dynamic programming.\n\n We need to assign each digit (from left to right) to either Homer or Marge, with the constraint that each gets exactly n digits.\n\n We can use state (i, h_count) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n-1) and h_count is the number of digits assigned to Homer so far.\n\n Then the total value contributed by the digits we have assigned so far? But note: the significance of a digit depends on how many digits remain to be assigned after it for the same player.\n\n However, we can precompute the future contributions.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire number for a player is built from the digits they get, and the position (i.e., the order) of the digits they get. The first digit they get (earliest) is multiplied by 10^(n-1), then the next by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n But the assignment is done in the order of the digits, so the k-th digit assigned to a player will be placed at the (k-1)-th position (from the most significant).\n\n But the catch: we don't know the entire assignment until the end. However, we can use DP that tracks:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total value (S1+S2) we can achieve from the first i digits, having assigned h digits to Homer and i-h to Marge.\n\n But how do we account for the digits' values and their future significance?\n\n Note: The total value is the sum of two numbers, each built from the digits assigned to the respective player.\n\n However, the value of a digit depends on when it is taken and by which player.\n\n We can break down:\n\n   When we assign a digit to a player, we know that this digit will be placed in the current most significant available position for that player (which is the next position in their number, from left to right). \n\n   But the total value for that player is built by:\n\n        If a player has k digits so far, then the next digit (if any) will be appended (as the least significant) and the existing digits shift their significance by one (i.e., multiplied by 10). \n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that also accumulates the current partial numbers for both players. However, the numbers can be very large (up to 36 digits) and we cannot store the entire number in the state.\n\n Another idea: since the total value is additive and the assignment is sequential, we can use the fact that the contribution of a digit to the final score is:\n\n   For a digit d assigned to a player at the j-th move (j from 0 to n-1) for that player, its value is d * (10^(n-1-j)).\n\n But note: the assignment order is fixed (we are processing from left to right). However, the assignment to a player is not necessarily contiguous. But the moves are taken in order: the first digit is always the first one, and if we assign it to Homer, then the next time we assign a digit to Homer, it will be the second digit of Homer's number (unless there are other digits in between).\n\n Actually, the assignment is in the order of the digits. So if we assign the digit at position i to Homer, then this digit will be the (h_count+1)-th digit for Homer (so its place value is 10^(n - (h_count+1))? \n\n Wait, let me clarify:\n\n   Let the entire sequence be d0, d1, d2, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n   Suppose we assign the digits at positions i0, i1, ..., i_{n-1} to Homer (with i0 < i1 < ... < i_{n-1}).\n\n   Then the number for Homer is: d_{i0} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i1} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{i_{n-1}} * 10^0.\n\n   Similarly for Marge.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is:\n\n   S1 + S2 = (d_{i0} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i1} * 10^(n-2) + ...) + (d_{j0} * 10^(n-1) + d_{j1} * 10^(n-2) + ...)\n\n Now, note that the exponents for a digit depend only on the count of digits that were assigned to the same player that appear earlier in the sequence (because the digits are taken in order).\n\n However, we can precompute for each digit, if we know the total number of digits that will be assigned to a player before a particular digit (for that player), then we know the exponent.\n\n But we don't know the entire assignment until the end.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP that goes through the digits and for each state (i, h) we store the total value achieved so far (for both players) and also the information about the exponents? \n\n But the exponents depend on the entire assignment. However, note:\n\n   The total value from the digits assigned so far is fixed by the assignment and the order, but the exponents for the digits that haven't been assigned yet are not known.\n\n However, we can separate the value:\n\n   The value from a digit d_i is: d_i * (10^(exponent)), where the exponent is determined by the number of digits that are assigned to the same player that occur after d_i in the entire sequence? \n\n Actually, no: the exponent for a digit in a player's number is determined by the position of the digit in that player's own sequence. For Homer, if we assign k digits to him so far, and there are (n - k) digits still to be assigned to him, then the next digit assigned to Homer will be the (k+1)-th digit and will have exponent (n - (k+1)).\n\n But wait, the exponent is determined by the total number of digits assigned to that player that have already been assigned? \n\n   In the entire game, the digits are processed in order. When we assign a digit to a player, the player's number is built from the digits they've received so far, with the most recently assigned digit being the least significant.\n\n   However, the problem is that we are building the number from left to right, but the digits are taken from the front. The assignment does not change the order of the digits, only which player gets which.\n\n   Actually, the digits assigned to a player must be in increasing order of their indices (because we process from left to right). So for Homer, the digits are taken in the order they appear. Then the first digit assigned to Homer is the most significant, the second is the next, etc.\n\n   Therefore, the exponent for a digit d_i assigned to Homer is: 10^( (number of digits assigned to Homer from the beginning to i) - 1) ?\n\n   But note: the entire assignment for Homer must have exactly n digits. The digit d_i will be the k-th digit for Homer, so its exponent is 10^(n - k - 1) ? Actually, no: the first digit (k=0) should be multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   So if we assign k digits to Homer (including d_i) then d_i is the (k-th) digit and its exponent is 10^(n - k - 1) ? Actually, the exponent decreases by one for each subsequent digit.\n\n   However, we cannot know k until we assign all the digits? \n\n But note: we are processing from left to right. At the moment we assign a digit, we know how many digits that player has already assigned (so we know k). Then we can add the value for that digit.\n\n However, the problem is that we are going to assign digits that come after d_i to the same player, and those will reduce the exponent of d_i? No, actually the exponent of d_i is fixed once we know the total number of digits that player will get (n) and the order of assignment (i.e., the k-th digit). The exponent for d_i is 10^(n - k - 1) only if we knew that d_i is the k-th digit for that player. But wait, the k-th digit is the one that appears at the k-th assignment to that player, and the assignments are in the order of the digits.\n\n However, the entire sequence is fixed. The digit d_i will be the k-th digit for Homer if and only if there are exactly k-1 digits assigned to Homer among the digits to the left of d_i.\n\n Therefore, when we are at digit i, we know the count of Homer's digits so far (h) and the total digits to the left is i. The remaining digits (to the right) will be assigned arbitrarily.\n\n The key: the exponent for a digit d_i when assigned to a player is fixed by the total number of digits that player will get from the entire sequence and the position of d_i relative to the other digits assigned to that player.\n\n Specifically, if we assign d_i to Homer, then the total number of digits Homer will get is n, and the position of d_i in Homer's sequence is (h_so_far + 1) (if we assign it now) but then we don't know the rest. However, the exponent for d_i is not fixed until we know the entire assignment.\n\n But note: the exponent for a digit in the final number is determined by the total number of digits that player gets from the entire sequence and the rank of d_i in the set of digits assigned to that player.\n\n However, the rank is determined by the number of digits assigned to that player that are to the left of d_i (which we know) and the digits to the right that are assigned to that player (which we don't know). \n\n This seems complicated.\n\n Let's try to reframe:\n\n   Let X be the set of digits assigned to Homer (size n) and Y to Marge (size n). Then:\n\n   S1 = sum_{x in X} (value of x in its position in X) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit at the k-th smallest index in X) * (10^(n-1-k))\n\n   Similarly for S2.\n\n   And the total prize is S1+S2.\n\n   Now, note that the entire set of digits is fixed. The total prize can be written as:\n\n      = sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} d_i * (10^(exponent_i))\n\n   where exponent_i is defined as:\n\n        If the digit d_i is assigned to a player, then the exponent is determined by the rank of d_i in the set of digits assigned to that player (counting from the most significant: the first digit assigned to a player (by index) gets exponent n-1, then n-2, etc.)\n\n   However, note: the rank is by the order of occurrence. So if we assign a digit at a lower index, then it appears earlier (more significant) than a digit at a higher index.\n\n   Therefore, the exponent for a digit d_i is:\n\n        If we assign d_i to Homer, then let r_i be the number of digits in X that are at indices <= i. Then the exponent is n - r_i (but wait, the most significant digit is the one with the highest index? No, the most significant is the one that appears first (lowest index). Actually, the first digit (lowest index) assigned to Homer is the most significant. So the exponent for a digit d_i is: n - (the order of d_i in the sorted-by-index list of X) - 1.\n\n   But note: the entire set X is fixed, and the order is by increasing index.\n\n   Therefore, the exponent for d_i is: n - (the count of digits in X that have index <= i) - 1? Actually, no: the first digit (lowest index) is the most significant, so it gets exponent n-1, the second (next lowest index) gets n-2, etc.\n\n   So for a digit d_i, if we assign it to a player, then its exponent is: (n - 1 - (the number of digits assigned to that player that have index < i))\n\n   Why? Because the digits assigned to that player that have index less than i will be more significant (so they have higher exponents). The digit d_i will be the (rank)-th digit (counting from the most significant) where rank = (number of digits in the player's set with index <= i) (but note: we are at i, so we consider digits up to i). However, we are processing from left to right, so at the time we assign d_i, we know the digits to the left that are assigned to the same player.\n\n   Actually, we can compute the exponent at the moment we assign the digit:\n\n        When we assign d_i to Homer, then the exponent for d_i is: (n - 1 - (current count of Homer's digits from the digits we've seen so far))\n\n   But wait, that is the exponent if we only consider the digits we've seen so far. What about the digits that we haven't seen (to the right)? They will also be assigned to Homer, and they will be less significant than d_i? \n\n   Actually, the digits to the right (with higher indices) will be less significant, so they don't affect the exponent of d_i. The exponent of d_i is determined solely by the total number of digits that Homer gets from the entire sequence that have index less than or equal to i. But note: the entire sequence is fixed, and we know that there will be n digits for Homer. However, the digits to the right that are assigned to Homer will have higher indices, so they are less significant, so they don't change the exponent of d_i.\n\n   Therefore, the exponent for d_i is: n - 1 - (number of digits assigned to Homer that are at indices < i) \n\n   But note: at the time we process d_i, we haven't assigned the digits to the right. However, the digits to the right that are assigned to Homer will have higher indices, so they don't count for the rank of d_i (they are less significant). So the rank of d_i is (number of Homer's digits from indices <= i) = (current count of Homer's digits) [because we are at i, and we have seen i+1 digits, and the current count is the number of Homer's digits we have chosen so far].\n\n   Therefore, the exponent is n - 1 - (current count of Homer's digits) [if we assign d_i to Homer now, then the current count will become (current_count+1), but the exponent is based on the current_count (the number of Homer's digits we have so far, not including d_i)].\n\n   Similarly, if we assign d_i to Marge, then the exponent for d_i in Marge's number is: n - 1 - (current count of Marge's digits) [again, the current count is the number of Marge's digits so far, not including d_i].\n\n   Therefore, we can use DP:\n\n        dp[i][h] = maximum total prize (S1+S2) we can achieve from the first i+1 digits (from index 0 to i), having assigned h digits to Homer (and i+1-h to Marge).\n\n        Then, for the next digit (index i+1):\n\n            Option 1: assign to Homer -> then the value added is: d_{i+1} * (10^(n-1 - h))   [because the current count for Homer is h, so the exponent is n-1 - h]\n\n            Option 2: assign to Marge -> then the value added is: d_{i+1} * (10^(n-1 - (i+1 - h)))   [because the current count for Marge is (i+1 - h) (since we have i+1 digits and h to Homer, then Marge has (i+1-h))]\n\n        Then:\n\n            dp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + int(d_{i+1}) * (10**(n-1-h)))\n            dp[i+1][h]   = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + int(d_{i+1}) * (10**(n-1-(i+1-h))))\n\n        But note: the exponent for Marge is: n-1 minus the current count of Marge's digits (which is (i+1-h) because we have i+1 digits and h for Homer, so Marge has i+1-h). \n\n        However, wait: the current count for Marge is (i+1-h) and that is the number of digits Marge has so far (from the first i+1 digits). Then the next digit (if assigned to Marge) is the (i+1-h+1)-th digit? Actually, no: the exponent for the next Marge digit is n-1 - (current count of Marge's digits) because the current count of Marge's digits is the number of Marge's digits so far, and the next one will be the next more significant (if we assign now) but wait: the next digit is the least significant so far? \n\n        Actually, the exponent for the digit we assign now is determined by the current count (the number of digits already assigned to that player) because the next digit will be the least significant so far (so it gets the lowest exponent we have used so far). \n\n        However, note: the entire number for a player is built from the digits they get, and the first digit they get (earliest) is the most significant. So the exponent for a digit is determined by the total number of digits they will get (n) and the rank of that digit in their set (by index). But in our DP, we are building the number from left to right, and the exponent for a digit is fixed by the number of digits that player has already received (from the left). \n\n        Example: n=2, two digits for each.\n\n        Suppose we have four digits: d0, d1, d2, d3.\n\n        If we assign d0 to Homer, then his number starts with d0 and then the next digit he gets (say d2) will be the second digit. The exponent for d0 is 10^1, and for d2 is 10^0.\n\n        Now, if we assign d0 to Homer and then d1 to Marge, then d2: if we assign to Homer, then d2 is the second digit for Homer -> exponent 10^0.\n\n        But what if we assign d2 to Marge? Then d2 is the second digit for Marge -> exponent 10^0.\n\n        However, in the DP we are only concerned with the current assignment. The exponent for a digit is determined by the current count (the number of digits the player has already got) and the fact that the player's number will have n digits. But note: the digit d2 is the second digit for the player regardless of what happens after? \n\n        Actually, no: the entire set of digits for a player is fixed to be n. The digit d2 is the (current_count+1)-th digit for the player. The exponent for d2 is 10^(n - (current_count+1) - 1)? \n\n        Let me correct: the exponent for a digit is 10^(n - (position_in_player_sequence) - 1) for the position_in_player_sequence from 0 to n-1.\n\n        But in our DP, the current_count is the number of digits the player has already, so the next digit (if we assign) will be the (current_count+1)-th, so its exponent is 10^(n - (current_count+1) - 1) = 10^(n - current_count - 2). \n\n        However, wait: the first digit (current_count=0) gets exponent 10^(n-1). The second (current_count=1) gets 10^(n-2). So the exponent is 10^(n - current_count - 1).\n\n        Therefore, the value added by assigning d_{i} to Homer is: int(d_i) * (10^(n - h - 1)), where h is the current count of Homer's digits (before assigning d_i).\n\n        Similarly for Marge: we have m = (i - h) [the number of Marge's digits so far in the first i digits] but wait, we are at the i-th digit (0-indexed) and we have processed i+1 digits? \n\n        Actually, let me define:\n\n          dp[i][h]: after processing the first i digits (i from 0 to 2n-1), having assigned h digits to Homer (so 2n-1-i digits left to assign, and i+1-h digits to Marge? Actually, we have processed i+1 digits).\n\n        Then, when processing the (i+1)-th digit (index i), we are at the (i+1)-th digit (0-indexed, so the digit at position i).\n\n        The state is (i, h): we have processed i+1 digits (from 0 to i) and assigned h digits to Homer.\n\n        Then the value for assigning the current digit (at index i) to Homer is:\n\n           value_Homer = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - 1 - h))\n\n        Why n-1-h? Because the current count of Homer's digits is h (so the next digit (if assigned) is the (h+1)-th, and the exponent is n - (h+1) - 1 + 1? \n\n        Actually, the exponents for Homer's digits:\n\n          First digit: h=0 -> exponent = n-1\n          Second: h=1 -> exponent = n-2\n          ...\n          k-th: h=k-1 -> exponent = n - k\n\n        So for the (h+1)-th digit (current assignment) the exponent is n - (h+1) - 1 + 1? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the first digit (h=0) is the most significant, so exponent n-1. Then the next (h=1) is the next, so exponent n-2, so the exponent for the digit assigned now (making it the (h+1)-th) is n - (h+1) - 1? \n\n        Let me check: \n          n=2, h=0: exponent = 2-0-1 = 1 -> 10^1 -> correct (first digit).\n          Then if we assign again (h=1): exponent = 2-1-1 = 0 -> 10^0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the formula for the (h+1)-th digit: the exponent should be n - (h+1) - 1? That would be n - h - 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: exponent = n - 1 - h (if we are going to assign this digit as the (h+1)-th, then we have h digits already, so the next digit is the (h+1)-th and its exponent is n - (h+1) - 1? \n\n        Actually, the exponent for the (k)-th digit (k from 0 to n-1) is 10^(n-1-k). \n\n        Here, k = h (because we are about to assign the (h+1)-th digit, so the index in the player's sequence is h). \n\n        Then exponent = n-1-h.\n\n        Example: n=2, h=0: exponent=1 -> correct. h=1: exponent=0 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the value added by assigning A[i] to Homer is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n\n        Similarly, for Marge, the current count of Marge's digits is (i+1 - h) (because we have processed i+1 digits, and h to Homer, so i+1-h to Marge). Then the next digit (if assigned to Marge) is the ((i+1-h)+1)-th digit for Marge? \n\n        Actually, no: we are at the (i+1)-th digit (0-indexed, so we are at the (i+1)-th digit) and we have assigned h digits to Homer and (i+1-h) to Marge. Then if we assign this digit to Marge, then Marge's count becomes (i+1-h). But wait, we are at the (i+1)-th digit, and we are going to assign it. So the state is (i, h) and we are processing the i-th digit (0-indexed). \n\n        Let me redefine the state: we are processing the i-th digit (from 0 to 2n-1) and we have assigned h digits to Homer (so Marge has i - h digits so far, because we have processed i digits).\n\n        Then the value for assigning the i-th digit to Homer is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n\n        And for Marge: the current count for Marge is (i - h) (because we have processed i digits and h to Homer, so Marge has i - h). Then the exponent for Marge's next digit is n-1 - (i - h) [because Marge's count is (i-h) and we are going to assign the next one, which is the (i-h+1)-th, so exponent n-1 - (i-h)].\n\n        However, wait: the exponent for a digit in Marge's number is determined by the total number of digits Marge has, and the order. The first digit Marge gets (the earliest) is the most significant. So the exponent for the digit we assign now (if to Marge) is: n-1 - (current count of Marge's digits) = n-1 - (i - h)\n\n        But note: the current count of Marge's digits is (i - h) (from the first i digits). Then the next one (this digit) is the (i-h+1)-th, so the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) is incorrect? \n\n        Let me check: n=2, i=0 (first digit). We are processing the first digit (A[0]). \n          If we assign to Marge: then Marge's count becomes 1 (because current count was 0). Then the exponent should be 1 (n-1). \n          According to the formula: n-1 - (i-h) = 2-1 - (0-0) = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Now, i=1 (second digit). We have processed 2 digits, and say we assigned the first to Marge (so h=0, then Marge has 2-0=2? wait, no: the state is (i=1, h=0) -> then Marge has 1 digit (from the first digit). Then if we assign the second digit to Marge, then we are at the second digit (index1) and the current count for Marge is 1. Then the exponent should be 0. \n          Formula: n-1 - (i-h) = 2-1 - (1-0) = 1 - 1 = 0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, in the state (i, h) we have processed i+1 digits? Actually, in our state definition, i is the index (from 0 to 2n-1) and we are going to use the digit at index i. Then we have processed i+1 digits (from 0 to i). Then the current count for Marge is (i+1 - h). \n\n        Therefore, the correct state: we are at digit i (0-indexed) and we have processed i+1 digits, so Marge's count is (i+1 - h). Then the exponent for Marge is n-1 - (i+1 - h) ?\n\n        Actually, the current count (already assigned) for Marge is (i+1 - h). Then the next assignment to Marge (this digit) will be the (i+1 - h + 1)-th digit for Marge. But the exponent for the next digit is determined by the current count (the number of digits Marge already has) because the next digit is the least significant so far. \n\n        However, the exponent is: n-1 - (current count) [because the current count is the number of digits Marge has, so the next one is the (current count+1)-th, and the exponent is n-1 - (current count) for the next one? \n\n        Let me test: n=2, i=0, h=0: \n            Marge's current count = 0+1-0 = 1? Actually, we have processed 1 digit (i+1=1) and h=0, so Marge has 1 digit? But we haven't assigned any digit to Marge! \n\n        Correction: the state should be: we have processed i+1 digits, and we have assigned h digits to Homer. Then the number of digits assigned to Marge is (i+1 - h). \n\n        Then, the current count for Marge is (i+1 - h). \n\n        Then, if we assign the current digit to Marge, then the exponent is n-1 - (i+1 - h) ?\n\n        Example: i=0, h=0: \n            Marge's current count = 1 (because i+1=1, h=0 -> 1-0=1) -> then exponent = 2-1-1 = 0 -> but wait, the first digit assigned to Marge should be the most significant (exponent 1). \n\n        This is wrong.\n\n        Let me think: the exponent is determined by the rank (the order) in the player's sequence. The first digit (earliest) gets exponent n-1. \n\n        In the above, we are using the current count (the number of digits already assigned) to compute the exponent for the next digit. \n\n        Actually, the exponent for the next digit (when adding to a player) is: n-1 - (current count) \n\n        Because: \n            current count = 0 -> exponent = n-1 (first digit)\n            current count = 1 -> exponent = n-2 (second digit)\n\n        But wait, that matches: exponent = n-1 - (current count)\n\n        However, in our state, the current count for Marge is (i+1 - h) (the total digits assigned to Marge so far). Then the next digit (if assigned to Marge) will be the (current count + 1)-th digit, and its exponent is n-1 - (current count) [not current count+1]?\n\n        Actually, no: the current count is the number of digits already assigned. The next digit is the (current count+1)-th, so its exponent is n-1 - (current count) (because the first digit (current count=0) is exponent n-1, the second (current count=1) is n-2, etc.). \n\n        So the exponent for the next digit is n-1 - (current count) [which is the same as n-1 - (number of digits already assigned to that player)].\n\n        Therefore, for Marge, the current count is (i+1 - h). Then the value for assigning the current digit to Marge is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1 - (i+1 - h)))\n\n        But note: the current count for Marge is (i+1 - h). \n\n        Now, let me test with the example above (n=2, i=0, h=0 for Marge):\n\n            current count for Marge = 0+1-0 = 1? That doesn't make sense because we haven't assigned any digit to Marge. \n\n        I see: the state is (i, h): we are about to process the i-th digit (so we have processed i digits, not i+1). \n\n        Let me redefine the state to avoid confusion.\n\n        Alternative state: \n          Let dp[i][h] = maximum total prize after processing the first i digits (0-indexed, so i from 0 to 2n) and having assigned h digits to Homer (so i-h digits to Marge).\n\n        Then, we have i digits processed. Now, we are going to process the i-th digit (the next one, the i-th digit in 0-indexed, so the digit at index i).\n\n        Then, for the i-th digit (the (i+1)-th digit overall, because we started at 0) we have:\n\n          If we assign to Homer: \n             value = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1 - h))\n             new_state: (i+1, h+1)\n\n          If we assign to Marge:\n             value = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1 - (i - h)))   # because Marge's current count is (i - h) (since we have processed i digits, and h to Homer, so Marge has i-h digits)\n             new_state: (i+1, h)\n\n        Then, the base case: dp[-1][*] = 0 (or dp[0][0]=0) and we iterate i from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n        Then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number. The goal is to assign exactly half of the digits to each player such that the sum of their respective numbers (formed by the digits they select) is maximized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing a sequence of digits and assigning each digit to one of the two players, ensuring each player ends up with exactly half of the digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal assignment sequence that maximizes the sum of the two numbers formed by the players.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][h]` represents the maximum total prize achievable after processing the first `i` digits, with `h` digits assigned to Homer. The remaining `i - h` digits are assigned to Marge.\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit at position `i`, we consider two choices:\n   - **Assign to Homer**: The digit's value contributes `digit * 10^(n-1-h)` to the total prize, where `h` is the current count of digits assigned to Homer.\n   - **Assign to Marge**: The digit's value contributes `digit * 10^(n-1-(i-h))` to the total prize, where `i-h` is the current count of digits assigned to Marge.\n4. **Base Case**: The initial state `dp[0][0]` is set to 0, indicating no digits processed and no assignments made.\n5. **Result Extraction**: After processing all digits, the solution is found in `dp[2n][n]`, representing the maximum prize when all digits are processed and each player has exactly `n` digits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    \n    dp = [[-1] * (n+1) for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    seq = [''] * total_digits\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            if dp[i][h] == -1:\n                continue\n            if h < n:\n                value_Homer = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n-1-h))\n                new_val = dp[i][h] + value_Homer\n                if dp[i+1][h+1] < new_val:\n                    dp[i+1][h+1] = new_val\n                    seq[i] = 'H'\n            m = i - h\n            if m < n:\n                value_Marge = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n-1 - m))\n                new_val = dp[i][h] + value_Marge\n                if dp[i+1][h] < new_val:\n                    dp[i+1][h] = new_val\n                    seq[i] = 'M'\n    \n    result = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (half the number of digits) and a string `A` (the digits to process).\n2. **Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized to store intermediate results, with `dp[i][h]` tracking the maximum prize after processing `i` digits and assigning `h` digits to Homer.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit, the algorithm checks both possible assignments (to Homer or Marge). The value added by each assignment depends on the digit's position in the respective player's number, determined by the current count of digits assigned to that player.\n4. **Tracking Sequence**: The sequence of assignments ('H' for Homer, 'M' for Marge) is recorded during the DP transitions to reconstruct the optimal move sequence.\n5. **Output**: The final sequence of moves, which maximizes the total prize, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible assignments using dynamic programming, ensuring the optimal solution is found without resorting to brute-force methods, which would be computationally infeasible for larger inputs.",
