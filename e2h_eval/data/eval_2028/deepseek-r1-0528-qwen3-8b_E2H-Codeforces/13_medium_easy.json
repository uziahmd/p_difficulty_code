For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the list of 12 notes). But note: the problem lists the notes as starting with C and then going up to H (which is B in some systems, but here H is the last). However, the example input includes 'A B H' and the note after H is C.\n\n Let's define the list of notes in order (from C to the next C, so 12 notes):\n   notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n But wait: the example says \"after H goes C\", so we have 12 distinct notes. However, the example input also includes 'C# B F'. Note that 'B' and 'H' are different? Actually, the example input has two different notations? \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"C# B F\" -> minor.\n\n However, the note list provided in the problem is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n So there are 12 distinct notes. But wait, in standard music, B and H are the same note? Actually, no: the problem states that the notes are 12 and they are repeated cyclically. The problem defines the notes as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n This means that the note \"B\" and \"H\" are two distinct notes? Actually, let's count: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> that's 12.\n\n But wait, in standard Western music, the chromatic scale is 12 notes: \n   C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E/Fb, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, B/H/As (but wait, sometimes B is called H in some languages). However, in the problem, the note after B is H, and then it cycles back to C. \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" So we have two different names for two different semitones: B and H. \n\n However, looking at the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. And then in the example input: ['A B H'] -> strange.\n\n But wait, the example input \"A B H\": \n   A, B, H. In our list, the order is:\n     9: A, 10: B, 11: H.\n\n Now, we have to compute the distances in semitones. Since the circle has 12 notes, we can compute the circular distance.\n\n Important: The problem says the distance from the lowest tone to the highest one. But note that the chord is unordered. We can arrange the three notes in increasing order (considering the circularity) and then check for major or minor.\n\n However, note: the definition for major: \n   There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n      distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n      distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n Then the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\n Similarly, minor:\n      distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n      distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n How to compute the distance between two notes?\n   We have a circular list of 12 notes. The distance from note i to note j (in the direction of increasing pitch) is:\n      If we have two notes with indices i and j, then the distance is (j - i) mod 12, but if negative we adjust.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". Because from E to the next C: \n   E (index 4) to C (index 0): we can go forward: 4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->0 -> that's 8 steps? Actually, the circle is 12, so the forward distance from E to C is (0 - 4) mod 12? But that would be negative. \n\n Alternatively, we can consider two directions. But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we always take the positive direction (increasing pitch). However, when we have a chord, we might need to wrap around.\n\n Actually, the example says: distance between E and C is 8 semitones. That is because from E, going up by 8 semitones lands on C (since E -> F -> F# -> G -> G# -> A -> A# (which is B?) wait, no: our list is:\n\n   E (index 4) -> F (5) -> F# (6) -> G (7) -> G# (8) -> A (9) -> A# (10) -> B (11) -> C (0) -> so from E (4) to C (0) is 12-4+0? Not exactly.\n\n We can compute the circular distance without wrapping the entire set? Actually, we have to consider the circle.\n\n We can do: \n   Let base = sorted([i, j]) but wait, because it's circular we cannot just sort the indices.\n\n Instead, we can map the three notes to numbers, then find all cyclic permutations and check the condition.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) using the list: \n        note_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n  2. Given three notes, convert them to three numbers: [a, b, c]\n\n  3. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all cyclic orders (and also non-cyclic orders? Actually, the problem says \"If we can order the notes so that ...\". So we can arrange the three notes arbitrarily. However, the condition requires consecutive distances. We can try all 6 permutations? But note: the condition is defined on a consecutive triplet. Also, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set.\n\n  However, note: the definition does not require the notes to be consecutive in the original list, but the distances must be 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) for two consecutive intervals.\n\n  But the circle is 12, and we have three distinct notes. We can arrange the three notes in increasing order (with circularity) and then check the two conditions.\n\n  Alternatively, we can generate the six permutations and check for each if the condition holds.\n\n  However, note: the condition requires three notes in order (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3, or vice versa for minor.\n\n  But wait: the entire set of three notes must form a contiguous interval of 7 semitones? Actually, the major chord has intervals of 4 and 3, so total 7. But the circle is 12, so we might have two possibilities: the chord might wrap around? \n\n  Example: what if we have notes that are not consecutive? Actually, the chord is defined by the set of three notes. We can arrange the three notes in a circle and then the condition is that there exists a starting point such that moving forward 4 semitones and then 3 semitones brings us to the third note (without wrapping more than once?).\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"the distance along the musical scale\" from the lowest to the highest. But when we have a chord that wraps around, then the lowest and highest might not be adjacent in the linear representation.\n\n  Example: consider the chord C, E, G (as in the example). This is major. But what about the chord C, E, G#? \n\n  Actually, the problem states: the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to order arbitrarily. So we can consider any ordering.\n\n  Approach:\n\n  Let the three notes be represented by numbers: n1, n2, n3.\n\n  We can consider all cyclic shifts and also reverse? Actually, we can consider the three possible starting points and then the two directions? \n\n  Alternatively, we can consider the three possible pairs for the first interval (each note as the first, then the other two as second and third). Then check the two conditions.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  For each permutation of the three notes (there are 6 permutations), we can check:\n\n    Condition for major: \n        d1 = distance from first to second (in the forward direction, considering the circle: (second - first) mod 12, but if negative then add 12 and then take mod 12? Actually, we want the smallest nonnegative distance, but wait: the problem says from the lowest to the highest. However, the definition says the chord is an unordered set. \n\n  But note: the example says the distance between E and C is 8. This implies that when we are going from E to C (which is lower than E in pitch? Actually, no: the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we should arrange the three notes in increasing order. However, the chord can wrap around.\n\n  Let's clarify: the chord is a set of three distinct notes. We can arrange them in a circle. The condition for major is: there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3, and also the distance from X to Z is 7 (because 4+3=7). \n\n  However, note: the circle has 12 semitones. The entire circle is 12. So the chord might be arranged so that the three notes are consecutive in the circle? \n\n  Actually, the condition does not require the entire set to be consecutive without gaps. But note: the chord is defined by three distinct notes.\n\n  How to compute the distance from note A to note B (forward, without crossing 12)? \n      Let a = index of A, b = index of B.\n      One way: we can compute the forward distance from A to B: \n          If we are at A, then the next note is A+1, then A+2, ... until we reach B (wrapping around).\n          The forward distance from A to B is (b - a) % 12, but if (b - a) is negative, then we add 12 and then mod 12? Actually, we want the smallest nonnegative distance that is at least 0 and less than 12.\n\n      However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. \n          E is 4, C is 0. Then (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (if we use modulo operation that returns nonnegative). \n\n      So we can define a function for forward distance (from note a to note b) as:\n          dist = (b - a) % 12\n          But wait: if (b - a) is negative, then (b - a) % 12 gives a value between 0 and 11. However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, which is the forward (ascending) distance. But note: from E to C ascending: we go from E to F, F#,..., up to C (the next C). That is 8 semitones.\n\n      However, the problem also says: the distance between C and E is 4. \n          From C (0) to E (4): (4-0)%12 = 4, which is correct.\n\n      So the forward distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we get a large number? Actually, the modulo operation for negative: \n          (b - a) % 12: \n          For E to C: (0-4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8 (since -4 + 12 = 8)\n\n      But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. In the example E to C, E is higher than C in the current octave? No, actually in the circle, the next C is after E. But the problem considers the entire circle: so when we say from E to C, we are going from a higher note to a lower note? \n\n  Wait, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that the distance is defined in the direction of increasing pitch (from low to high). So from E to C, if we are only allowed to go up, then we have to go from E up to the next C, which is 8 semitones. \n\n  Therefore, we must consider the forward direction (always increasing) and the distance from a to b is the smallest nonnegative amount such that when you start at a and move up by that many semitones, you get to b (possibly wrapping around the circle). \n\n  But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are going from the lower note to the higher note. However, in the example E and C, if we have the chord {E, C}, then we cannot say which is the lowest without context. \n\n  However, in the chord we have three notes. We are allowed to order arbitrarily. So for the chord {E, C, G} we can order them as (C, E, G) because C is the lowest and then E and then G. But if we consider {E, C, G} and we try to order as (E, C, G) then we are going from E to C, which is downward? \n\n  The problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n  This ordering must be from the lowest to the highest? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that the ordering is by pitch, but the distance is defined from the lowest to the highest. \n\n  Let me read again: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". So the distance from a lower note to a higher note is the minimal upward movement (without going backward). \n\n  Therefore, we must order the three notes in increasing pitch (so that the first note is the lowest and the third is the highest). But wait, what if the chord wraps around? \n\n  Example: chord {C, E, G} is major. What if we have a chord {B, D, F}? \n      B is 10, D is 2, F is 5. \n      We have to arrange in increasing order: [B, D, F] -> but wait, in the circle: \n          The linear order: \n            B (10) is followed by C(0), then D(2) -> so actually the increasing order (without wrapping) would be: [B, C, D, E, F, ...] but then we have three notes: B, D, F.\n\n      We can arrange the three notes in the circle: \n          Start at B (10), then the next note is C (0) -> then D (2) -> then E (4) -> then F (5). \n\n      But the condition requires consecutive distances of 4 and 3 (for major). \n\n      Let's try to assign:\n        Option 1: order by increasing index: [B, D, F] -> [10, 2, 5]\n        Forward distance from B to D: (2 - 10) % 12 = (2-10) = -8 % 12 = 4? Actually, wait: we must consider the circle. The forward distance from B to D: \n            From B (10) to C (0) is 2 semitones? Then from C (0) to D (2) is 2, so total 4 semitones from B to D? Actually, the direct forward distance from B to D is (2 - 10 + 12) % 12 = (14) % 12 = 2? That doesn't match.\n\n      Let me recast: the forward distance from a to b is defined as the smallest nonnegative k such that (a + k) % 12 == b, and k is the number of semitones to go from a to b (in the forward direction). \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute the forward distance from a to b as (b - a) % 12, but if the result is negative, we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n          (b - a) % 12: \n          For a=10, b=2: (2-10) % 12 = (-8) % 12 = 4 (because -8 + 12 = 4). \n\n      Why is that? The forward distance from B to D: \n          B (10) -> C (0) -> C# (1) -> D (2): that's 4 semitones (from B to C is 1, then to C# is 2, then to D is 3? Actually, no: from B to C is 1 semitone? \n\n      Wait, the list: \n          10: B, 11: H, 0: C, 1: C#, 2: D.\n\n      So from B (10) to D (2): \n          Step 0: B (10)\n          Step 1: H (11)\n          Step 2: C (0)\n          Step 3: C# (1)\n          Step 4: D (2)\n\n      So the forward distance is 4.\n\n      Then the forward distance from D (2) to F (5) is (5-2) % 12 = 3.\n\n      Then the entire chord {B, D, F} would be: \n          Ordering: B, D, F -> distances: 4 and 3 -> major.\n\n      But wait, the example input also includes \"A B H\": \n          A (9), B (10), H (11). \n          Distances: \n            A to B: (10-9) % 12 = 1\n            B to H: (11-10) % 12 = 1\n            Then the entire set: we can try all orders.\n\n      However, the problem says the answer for \"A B H\" is \"strange\".\n\n  How to check for major and minor?\n\n  Conditions for major:\n      There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n          (Y - X) % 12 = 4   (forward distance from X to Y is 4)\n          (Z - Y) % 12 = 3   (forward distance from Y to Z is 3)\n\n      Then the entire chord: from X to Z: (Z - X) % 12 = (4+3) % 12 = 7.\n\n  Conditions for minor:\n      There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n          (Y - X) % 12 = 3\n          (Z - Y) % 12 = 4\n\n  However, note: the ordering must be by increasing pitch? Actually, the problem does not specify the order, but the distances are defined in the forward direction (so the ordering must be such that we are moving forward). \n\n  But note: the condition does not require that the entire set of three notes is contained in an interval of 7 semitones. Actually, the condition for major requires that the two intervals (4 and 3) add up to 7, and the entire set spans 7 semitones. \n\n  However, what if the chord spans more than 7? Actually, the condition is defined by consecutive intervals. The entire set must be three consecutive notes in a 7-semitone span? \n\n  But wait: the circle is 12. The chord could wrap around? \n\n  Example: Consider the chord {F, A, C}. \n      F (5), A (9), C (0). \n      Ordering: [F, A, C]: \n          Distance from F to A: (9-5) % 12 = 4 -> then from A to C: (0-9) % 12 = (0-9+12) % 12 = 3 -> so this is major.\n\n      But wait, the entire chord from F to C: (0-5) % 12 = (0-5+12) % 12 = 7, which matches.\n\n  However, what if we have a chord that doesn't fit in a 7-semitone span? \n\n  Example: {C, E, G#}: \n      C (0), E (4), G# (10)\n      Check major: \n          Ordering: C, E, G#: \n              C to E: (4-0)%12=4 -> good.\n              E to G#: (10-4)%12=6 -> not 3.\n          Ordering: C, G#, E: \n              C to G#: (10-0)%12=10 -> then G# to E: (4-10+12)%12= (4-10) %12 = (-6)%12=6 -> not 3.\n          Ordering: E, C, G#: \n              E to C: (0-4+12)%12=8 -> then C to G#: 10 -> not 3.\n          Ordering: E, G#, C: \n              E to G#: 6 -> then G# to C: (0-10+12)%12=2 -> no.\n          Ordering: G#, C, E: \n              G# to C: (0-10+12)%12=2 -> then C to E:4 -> total 6, but the condition requires consecutive: 2 and then 4 -> but the condition is defined for consecutive intervals. \n          Ordering: G#, E, C: \n              G# to E: (4-10+12)%12= (4-10) %12 -> negative: 6 -> then E to C: 8 -> no.\n\n      So {C, E, G#} is strange.\n\n  However, wait: the chord {C, E, G#} is actually an augmented chord, but that's beyond our scope.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n  Let the three notes be s, t, u.\n\n  Convert to numbers: [x, y, z] = [note_to_index(note) for note in [s,t,u]]\n\n  Then, we consider the six permutations of [x,y,z]. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n      Condition for major: \n          d1 = (b - a) % 12   (this gives the forward distance from a to b, but if negative we adjust by modulo)\n          d2 = (c - b) % 12\n          Then we require d1 == 4 and d2 == 3.\n\n      Condition for minor:\n          d1 = (b - a) % 12 == 3 and d2 == 4.\n\n  However, wait: the modulo operation for negative numbers: \n      (b - a) % 12 is computed as: (b - a) mod 12, which is the same as (b - a + 12*k) % 12 for some k to make it positive.\n\n  But note: the forward distance from a to b should be the minimal positive steps to get from a to b in the forward direction. \n\n  However, the condition in the problem does not require the entire set to be within one octave? Actually, the chord is defined by three distinct notes, and the distances are given in semitones (absolute). \n\n  But note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's check:\n\n      Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n\n      We must find an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the forward distances are 3 and 4.\n\n      Possibilities:\n\n        Order 1: [B, C#, F] -> [10,1,5]\n            B to C#: (1-10) % 12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3 -> then C# to F: (5-1)%12=4 -> minor condition met.\n\n      So we found minor.\n\n  However, note: the ordering [B, C#, F] is not the increasing order of the indices. But the problem says \"if we can order the notes\", meaning we can choose any order.\n\n  But wait: the condition requires the ordering to be such that the distances are 3 and 4. The ordering [B, C#, F] is valid because we are going from B (pitch 10) to C# (pitch 1) which is 3 semitones (forward: from B to C# goes through C and C#? Actually, from B (10) to C (0) is 2 semitones (because 10->11->0) but wait, our mapping:\n\n      B is 10, then next is H (11), then C (0). So from B to C is 2 semitones. Then from C to C# is 1, so from B to C# is 3 semitones.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n      Define note_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n      Create a dictionary for mapping:\n          note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_list)}\n\n      Read the input string, split to get three note strings.\n\n      Convert each note string to an index.\n\n      Generate all permutations of the three indices (there are 6).\n\n      For each permutation (a, b, c):\n          d1 = (b - a) % 12   [This gives a value between 0 and 11]\n          d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n          Then check:\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3: then print \"major\" and break.\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4: then print \"minor\" and break.\n\n      If none of the permutations satisfies either condition, then print \"strange\".\n\n  However, wait: what if the chord is major but the entire set of three notes is not consecutive in the 12-note circle? \n\n  Example: major chord should have the three notes separated by 4 and 3, so the entire span is 7. But what if we have a chord that is 7 semitones apart, but the third note is not the next one? \n\n  Actually, the condition is defined by the consecutive intervals. \n\n  But note: the condition does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the entire circle. They are three distinct notes, and the condition is about the two consecutive intervals.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the modulo operation for the forward distance from a to b: \n\n      We defined d1 = (b - a) % 12. This gives the forward distance from a to b without wrapping? Actually, no: it accounts for wrapping.\n\n      But note: the condition must hold for the entire set. However, the problem does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the circle without gaps. \n\n      But wait: the example {C, E, G} is major. The forward distance from C to E is 4, from E to G is 3. The entire chord is 7 semitones.\n\n      However, if we consider a chord that is not contained in a 7-semitone span, then we might not find the condition.\n\n      But note: the definition requires consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). The entire set of three notes must be arranged so that the two intervals are consecutive. \n\n      However, the circle has 12 semitones, and the condition requires the two intervals to be 4 and 3 (total 7). So the entire set must lie in a 7-semitone span? \n\n      Actually, no: the condition does not require that the entire set is contained in a 7-semitone span. It requires that the two consecutive intervals (from X to Y and Y to Z) are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). The entire set from X to Z is 7, but the circle has 12, so the set might be contained in a 7-semitone span or not? \n\n      However, the forward distance from X to Z is (Z - X) % 12, and that must be (4+3) % 12 = 7. But wait: if the chord is {C, E, G}, then from C to G: (6-0)=6? Wait, no: C is 0, E is 4, G is 7? \n\n      Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the note indices.\n\n      The note_list is:\n          0: 'C'\n          1: 'C#'\n          2: 'D'\n          3: 'D#'\n          4: 'E'\n          5: 'F'\n          6: 'F#'\n          7: 'G'\n          8: 'G#'\n          9: 'A'\n          10: 'B'\n          11: 'H'\n\n      Then G is 7. So the chord C, E, G: \n          C (0), E (4), G (7)\n          Condition: \n            d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n      Now, the entire chord from C to G: (7-0)%12=7.\n\n      Now, what if we have a chord that is major but the entire set is not contained in a 7-semitone span? \n\n      Example: {C, E, G} is 7 semitones. \n\n      What about {C, E, G}'s inversion? \n\n      Example: {E, G, C}: \n          E (4), G (7), C (0)\n          d1 = (7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12= (0-7+12)%12=5 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n      But wait, we can reorder arbitrarily. The condition does not require the order to be by increasing index. \n\n      Actually, we are generating all permutations. So we will also consider [C, E, G] and [E, G, C] and [G, C, E] etc.\n\n      But the condition for major requires the consecutive intervals to be 4 and 3. \n\n      In the permutation [E, G, C]: \n          d1 = (7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n\n      What about [E, C, G]? \n          d1 = (0-4)%12=8, d2=(7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n\n      [G, E, C]: \n          d1 = (4-7)%12= (4-7+12)%12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n      [G, C, E]:\n          d1 = (0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n\n      [C, G, E]:\n          d1 = (7-0)%12=7, d2=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)%12=9 -> no.\n\n      So the only permutation that works is [C, E, G].\n\n      Therefore, the condition requires that the three notes are arranged in the order of increasing pitch (with wrapping considered) and the consecutive intervals are 4 and 3.\n\n  However, note: the example \"C# B F\" (minor) was found by the permutation [B, C#, F] (which is [10,1,5]). \n\n  But wait: in the note_list, the note after B (10) is H (11) and then C (0). So the forward ordering by pitch of the three notes {B, C#, F} is [B, C, C#] but wait, we have F (5) which is higher than C#. \n\n  Actually, the three notes are B, C#, F. The pitches (in the circle) are:\n\n      B (10), C# (1), F (5)\n\n      To order by increasing pitch (without wrapping the entire set? Actually, we have to consider the circle: the lowest note is the one with the smallest index, but wait: the circle is cyclic. \n\n  However, the problem does not specify that the ordering must be by the index. But the forward distance is defined by the circle.\n\n  Our method: we are taking the numerical values (indices) and computing (b - a) % 12. This is the forward distance in the circle.\n\n  The key is: the condition does not require the ordering to be by the linear index, but by the actual pitch order (which is the same as the circle order). \n\n  But note: the circle order is the same as the index order from 0 to 11, and then 0 again. \n\n  However, the condition is defined by the forward distance, which is independent of the absolute position. \n\n  Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n  But wait: the condition for major requires the entire set to be arranged so that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3. However, the entire set might be arranged in a non-consecutive manner in the circle? \n\n  Example: {C, E, G} is consecutive. What about {C, E, G}'s inversion? \n\n  Actually, the inversion of a major chord is still a major chord, but the intervals change. \n\n  However, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set. The condition is defined by the existence of an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n  The inversion of a major chord is not major? Actually, no: the inversion of a major chord is still called a major chord, but the voicing is different. However, the problem does not mention inversions. \n\n  But note: the problem does not require the chord to be in root position. \n\n  Example: the first inversion of C major (C, E, G) is E, C, G. \n\n  Condition for [E, C, G]:\n      d1 = (C - E) % 12 = (0-4)%12=8, then d2=(G-C)%12= (7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n\n  Second inversion: [G, C, E]:\n      d1 = (0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n\n  So the condition as stated only holds for the root position. \n\n  However, the problem does not specify root position. \n\n  But note: the definition says \"an unordered set of no less than three notes\", and the condition is about ordering. \n\n  The condition for major: \"If we can order the notes so that ...\". \n\n  In the example, the set {E, C, G} can be ordered as [C, E, G] (which is the root position) and then the condition holds. But wait, the set is unordered. So we can choose the ordering [C, E, G] even if the input gives {E, C, G}? \n\n  Yes, because the set is unordered. \n\n  Therefore, we must consider all permutations (all orders) of the three notes.\n\n  But wait: the example \"C# B F\" was given as \"C# B F\", but the correct ordering for minor is [B, C#, F]. \n\n  How did we get that? We generated all permutations, so we try [B, C#, F] and found the condition.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      note_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n      note_to_index",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to a unique index (0 to 11) based on its position in a predefined list of 12 musical notes.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated. This is because the chord is an unordered set, and we need to check every possible ordering to find if any meets the chord criteria.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the forward distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale. A major chord requires the distances to be 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition, the corresponding result is printed. If no permutation meets either condition, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nnote_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_list)}\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    notes = [data[0], data[1], data[2]]\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            break\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            break\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_list` defines the order of musical notes starting from C to H. The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each note to its respective index (0 to 11).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes, which are split and converted into their corresponding indices.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all six possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the forward distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to ensure correct circular distance calculation.\n4. **Chord Condition Check**: For each permutation, the code checks if the distances between the first-second and second-third notes match the criteria for a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord. If found, the result is printed immediately.\n5. **Result Output**: If no valid ordering is found after checking all permutations, the chord is labeled \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutation generation and modular arithmetic for accurate distance calculation in a circular musical scale.",
