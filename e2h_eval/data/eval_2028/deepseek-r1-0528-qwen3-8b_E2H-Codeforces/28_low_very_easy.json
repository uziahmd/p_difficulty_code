String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of beautiful strings that can be obtained by starting from a string (which initially has n zeros and m ones) and then performing a sequence of modifications until the string becomes of length 1? Actually, note: the problem says that we have a string s that must have exactly n zeros and m ones. However, the process of modification is defined as replacing the last two characters by one character (which is 0 if the two were different, or 1 if they were same). \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the beautiful string is obtained by modifications from an initial string. Instead, it says: \n\"String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria: \n   - It only consists of characters 0 and 1.\n   - It must have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n   - We can obtain the character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\"\n\nWait, actually reading the problem statement again: \n\"String s is beautiful if ... and character g equals either zero or one. A modification ... This operation is allowed to reduce the string until we get a single character which must be g?\"\n\nBut note: the problem does not say that the beautiful string must be reduced to g. It says \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So the entire process must end with g.\n\nHowever, the problem is about the initial beautiful string s (with exactly n zeros and m ones) that can be reduced to g by the given operations.\n\nBut note: the example input: \"1 1 0\" -> output 2, and the beautiful strings are \"01\", \"10\". Then, what happens when we apply the operation on \"01\"? \nOperation: take last two (which is \"01\") -> replace by 0 (since they are different). Then we get \"0\", but then we stop because we cannot modify a string of length 1. But wait, the problem says we can do some (possibly zero) number of modifications. So the condition is that after some modifications, we end up with g.\n\nSo for \"01\": \n  Operation 1: becomes \"0\" (if we do one modification) -> then we have a string of length 1, so we stop. Then we require that the final character is g. In this case, if g is 0, then \"01\" is valid. Similarly, if we start with \"10\", we do: \n  Operation: last two \"10\" -> different -> becomes 0. Then we have \"0\", so if g=0 then \"10\" is valid.\n\nBut if g=1, then we require that the final character is 1. However, from \"01\" we get 0, and from \"10\" we get 0, so no string is valid.\n\nHowever, there's another way: we might do multiple modifications. For example, consider the second sample: n=2, m=2, g=0. The beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nLet me try \"0011\":\n  Operation 1: take last two \"11\" -> same -> becomes '1', so the string becomes \"001\"\n  Now, we have three characters: \"001\", then we take the last two: \"01\" -> different -> becomes 0, so the string becomes \"00\".\n  Then we stop? Actually, the operation is defined as taking the two last characters and replacing them by one. After the first operation, we have \"001\", then we can take the last two (which are \"01\") and replace by 0, giving \"00\". Then we stop because we don't have two characters? Actually, the operation requires at least two characters. So we stop at length 1? No, because we have two operations and then we have two characters again? Let me clarify:\n\nThe operation is defined as: replace two last characters by one. So after the first operation, we have \"001\" (length 3). Then we can do the operation again on the last two of \"001\", which are \"01\", and replace by 0, so we get \"00\" (length 2). Then we can do the operation again: replace \"00\" by 1 (because same) -> then we get \"1\" (length 1). \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" and the operation is done on the two last characters. So we can keep doing until the string has length 1.\n\nTherefore, the condition is: the entire reduction process (until we have a string of length 1) must",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a given character \\( g \\) through a series of modifications. The beautiful strings must consist of exactly \\( n \\) zeros and \\( m \\) ones. The modification operation involves replacing the last two characters of the string with one character (0 if the two characters are different, 1 if they are the same). The process continues until the string length is 1, and the final character must be \\( g \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the reduction process is deterministic. The final character \\( g \\) depends on the parity of zeros in the string. Specifically, the final character will be 1 if the total number of zeros in the initial string is odd; otherwise, it will be 0. This is because each modification operation effectively reduces the count of zeros by either 0 or 2, preserving the parity of the number of zeros.\n\n2. **Insight**: For the string to reduce to \\( g \\), the initial string must have a certain number of zeros. If \\( g \\) is 1, the initial number of zeros must be odd. If \\( g \\) is 0, the initial number of zeros must be even. \n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of valid strings is determined by the binomial coefficient \\( C(n + m, n) \\), but only for those cases where the number of zeros \\( n \\) satisfies the parity condition relative to \\( g \\). Specifically:\n   - If \\( g = 1 \\), we need \\( n \\) to be odd.\n   - If \\( g = 0 \\), we need \\( n \\) to be even.\n   - If \\( n \\) does not meet the required parity, the answer is 0.\n\n4. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result can be very large, we compute the binomial coefficients modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) using precomputed factorials and modular inverses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef precompute_factorials(max_n, mod=MOD):\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n    for i in range(max_n, 0, -1):\n        inv_fact[i - 1] = inv_fact[i] * i % mod\n    return fact, inv_fact\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    g = int(data[2])\n    \n    total = n + m\n    if n % 2 == g % 2:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            need_parity = 0\n        else:\n            need_parity = 1\n        \n        if need_parity != g % 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n        max_val = total\n        fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_val, MOD)\n        ways = fact[total] * inv_fact[n] % MOD * inv_fact[m] % MOD\n        print(ways)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The `precompute_factorials` function calculates factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum required value (sum of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\)) using Fermat's Little Theorem for efficient computation under modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n2. **Main Logic**: The `main` function reads input values \\( n \\), \\( m \\), and \\( g \\). It checks if the parity of \\( n \\) matches the required parity for \\( g \\). If not, it immediately outputs 0. Otherwise, it computes the binomial coefficient \\( C(n + m, n) \\) modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) using the precomputed factorials and prints the result.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles large values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) (up to \\( 10^5 \\)) by leveraging precomputation and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
