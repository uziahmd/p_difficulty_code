And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, then a list of n integers.\n We consider each contiguous subarray of length k as a week. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n However, note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, the second is (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n Then we have to take the average over the weeks? Actually, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait: the example says \"then the result is\" and then they don't show the overall average?\n Let me read the problem again: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n How many weeks? n-k+1 weeks. So we have to compute the sum of sleep hours for each week (each contiguous k days) and then take the average of these sums?\n\n Actually, the example output is 9.0. Let's break down:\n\n For the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   Week1: [3,4] -> sum = 7\n   Week2: [4,7] -> sum = 11\n\n Then total sum of all week sums is 7+11 = 18.\n Then average = 18 / (number of weeks) = 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n So the problem is: \n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j]\n\n But note: we can compute the total_sleep without iterating each week by using prefix sums.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n, k and the list a.\n  2. Precompute the prefix sum array for a.\n      Let prefix[0] = 0\n      prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a(i-1)\n\n  3. Then the sum for a week starting at i (from 0 to n-k) is:\n        s_i = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n  4. Total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} s_i = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n  5. Alternatively, we can combine the terms:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n  6. Then the average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n However, note that the prefix array is defined such that prefix[i] = sum(a[0:i]).\n So the entire array a's sum is prefix[n].\n\n But the above expression for total_sleep can be simplified:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n                 = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But we can also think of it as:\n\n      total_sleep = (sum_{i=k}^{n} prefix[i]) - (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} prefix[i])\n\n However, note: the indices in the prefix array go from 0 to n.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a single pass for the prefix and then use two loops? But n and k can be up to 200,000.\n\n But note: we don't want to iterate over n-k+1 weeks because that would be O(n) which is acceptable if we do it once, but then we can use the prefix method to avoid multiple summations.\n\n However, let's compute the total_sleep by:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But wait, is there a simpler way? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep by:\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n          total_sleep += sum(a[i:i+k])\n\n But that would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n, k up to 200000.\n\n Therefore, we use prefix sums.\n\n Steps with prefix:\n\n  Let prefix[0] = 0\n  For i from 1 to n:\n      prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n  Then the week starting at index i (0-indexed) has sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n  Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n  Now, we can break this sum:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n  But note: the terms are from prefix[k] to prefix[n] (with step 1) and subtract the terms from prefix[0] to prefix[n-k].\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n  But note: the second part is the sum of the first (n-k+1) prefix elements (from index0 to index n-k).\n\n  However, we can compute the two parts separately.\n\n  But wait, is there a better way? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a sliding window for the prefix array to compute the sum of a segment of the prefix array? \n\n  Actually, we can precompute the prefix for the prefix array? \n\n  However, we can just compute the two parts by:\n\n      part1 = sum(prefix[i] for i in range(k, n+1))   # from index k to n (inclusive)\n      part2 = sum(prefix[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))  # from index 0 to n-k (inclusive)\n\n  But note: our prefix array has length n+1 (indices 0..n). \n\n  Then total_sleep = part1 - part2.\n\n  However, let's test with the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n  prefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]   (because prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=a0=3, prefix[2]=3+4=7, prefix[3]=3+4+7=14)\n\n  part1 = prefix[2] + prefix[3] = 7 + 14 = 21\n  part2 = prefix[0] + prefix[1] + prefix[2] (since n-k+1 = 3-2+1=2, so we take indices 0 to 1? Wait, no: the second part is from index0 to index n-k (which is 1) inclusive? Actually, the indices for part2 are from 0 to n-k, which is 3-2=1, so indices 0 to 1 inclusive? \n\n  Correction: the second part is the sum of prefix[0] to prefix[n-k] (inclusive). In the example, n-k=1, so indices 0 to 1: \n        part2 = prefix[0] + prefix[1] = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\n  Then total_sleep = 21 - 3 = 18. Correct.\n\n  Then average = 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n  But wait: why are we subtracting the prefix[0] to prefix[n-k]? Because:\n\n        total_sleep = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n        = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: the number of terms in part1 is (n - k + 1) because from k to n (inclusive) there are n - k + 1 terms? Actually, the indices from k to n (inclusive) are: k, k+1, ..., n -> that's (n - k + 1) terms.\n\n  And part2: from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> (n-k+1) terms as well.\n\n  So we can compute:\n\n      total_sleep = (sum of prefix from index k to n) - (sum of prefix from index 0 to n-k)\n\n  Then divide by (n-k+1).\n\n  But note: we have to be cautious about the indices and the length of the prefix array.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      # Build prefix array of length n+1\n      prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      # The first part: sum from index k to n (inclusive)\n      # The second part: sum from index 0 to n-k (inclusive)\n\n      # But note: n-k might be negative? No, because k<=n.\n\n      # However, we can use built-in functions to sum segments of the prefix array.\n\n      # But note: the prefix array has n+1 elements (from 0 to n).\n\n      # We can do:\n      #   part1 = sum(prefix[k:])   # from index k to the end (which is index n, inclusive)\n      #   part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])   # from index 0 to index n-k (inclusive) because the last element we want is at index n-k, so we take [0: n-k+1] (since slicing in Python goes to the end of the specified index or one before the end if we specify stop)\n\n      # However, note: \n      #   prefix[k:] gives from index k to n (inclusive) -> correct for part1.\n      #   prefix[:n-k+1] gives from index 0 to index n-k (because the slice does not include the stop index) -> so we want to include index n-k. Since the stop index is n-k+1, then the slice goes from 0 to n-k (inclusive) because the stop index is exclusive.\n\n      # Example: n-k+1 = 2, then prefix[:2] gives [prefix[0], prefix[1]]\n\n      # That's correct.\n\n      total_sleep = sum(prefix[k:]) - sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n      average = total_sleep / (n - k + 1)\n\n  But wait, what if n-k+1 is 0? Then k==n, then we have one week. Then:\n      part1 = sum(prefix[n:]) = prefix[n] (if k==n, then part1 = prefix[n] - prefix[0] from the week, but wait our formula uses the entire prefix array from index n? Actually, when k==n, then the week is the whole array, and then we have one week.\n\n      part1 = sum(prefix[n:]) = prefix[n] (since the next index is beyond, so only one term at index n)\n      part2 = sum(prefix[:n-n+1]) = prefix[:1] -> just prefix[0]\n\n      total_sleep = prefix[n] - prefix[0] = (sum of entire array) - 0 = sum(a)\n\n      average = sum(a) / 1 = sum(a). Correct.\n\n  However, we can also do without building the entire prefix array and then summing two large slices (which could be O(n)), but note that n is 200000 and we are doing two passes (one for building prefix, and then two slices which are each O(n)), so total O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n  But let's consider the memory: we are storing an array of n+1 integers, which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n  However, we can avoid building the entire prefix array if we use a different method to compute the two sums. But building the prefix array is O(n) and necessary for the rest of the calculation.\n\n  Another approach: \n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      # We can use the fact that the total_sleep is the sum of a over all positions, but each position is counted how many times?\n\n      Consider an element at index i (0-indexed) in the original array a. It appears in a week if the week starts from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) [but actually, the week must start from 0 to i, and the week length is k, so the last week that includes a[i] is the week that starts at i-k+1 (if we require the week to end at i, then the start is i-k+1) and the first week that includes a[i] is the week that starts at 0? Actually:\n\n      The element a[i] is included in weeks that start from j such that j <= i and j >= i-k+1 (so the week starting at j must cover i, i.e., j <= i and j+k-1>=i -> j>= i-k+1). Also, j must be at least 0 and at most n-k.\n\n      So the number of weeks that include a[i] is: \n          count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ??? \n\n      Actually, the week starts from j=0 to j=n-k. The condition for a[i] to be included is j <= i and j >= i-k+1 (because the week from j to j+k-1 must include i, so j <= i and j+k-1>=i -> j>= i-k+1). So the valid j are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n      Then the number of weeks that include a[i] is: \n          L = max(0, i-k+1)\n          R = min(i, n-k)\n          count_i = R - L + 1, if L <= R, else 0.\n\n      Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * count_i.\n\n      Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n      Let's test with example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n      i=0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0, R=min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count_0 = 1\n      i=1: L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0, R=min(1,1)=1 -> count_1 = 2\n      i=2: L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1, R=min(2,1)=1 -> count_2 = 1\n\n      total_sleep = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18. Correct.\n\n      This method is also O(n) and avoids building the entire prefix array. However, we still need to build an array for the counts or use a direct formula.\n\n      But note: the two methods are both O(n). The first method (with prefix) is straightforward. The second method is also straightforward.\n\n      However, the second method might be more efficient in terms of memory (we don't need the entire prefix array, only the original array and then we traverse once to compute the count for each element). \n\n      But note: the problem constraints say n up to 200000, so either way is acceptable.\n\n  Let me choose the second method because it avoids storing the entire prefix array (though the memory usage is similar, but perhaps we can save a little).\n\n  Steps for the second method:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      total_weeks = n - k + 1\n      total_sleep = 0\n      # For each index i, the number of weeks that include a[i] is:\n      #   left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n      #   right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at n-k (the last week starts at n-k)\n      #   But note: the week that starts at j must satisfy j<=i and j>= i-k+1, and j must be in [0, n-k]. So the valid j are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). Then the count is: max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1) if the lower bound <= the upper bound, else 0.\n\n      However, we can simplify the condition:\n\n      Actually, the element a[i] is included in a week if the week starts at j and j<=i and j>= i-k+1. But j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). So:\n\n          low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n          high = min(i, n - k)   # because j cannot exceed i (since the week must start by i) and also j cannot exceed n-k (the last week starts at n-k)\n\n      Then if low <= high, count = high - low + 1, else 0.\n\n      But note: i can be from 0 to n-1.\n\n      However, we can also note that the element a[i] is included in min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ? Not exactly.\n\n      Alternatively, we can think: \n        The first week that includes a[i] is week starting at max(0, i-k+1)\n        The last week that includes a[i] is week starting at min(i, n-k)   [because the week must start by i (otherwise the week doesn't reach i) and also the week must end at or before n-1, so the week must start at most at n-k (so that the week ends at n-k+k-1 = n-1)]\n\n      Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1, provided that the lower bound <= the upper bound.\n\n      But wait, what if the week must start at most at i (so j<=i) and at least i-k+1, and also j must be at least 0 and at most n-k. \n\n      Actually, the condition for j is: \n          j <= i and j >= i-k+1 and j>=0 and j<=n-k.\n\n      So the effective j is in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)].\n\n      Then the count is: \n          if max(0, i-k+1) <= min(i, n-k):\n              count = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n          else:\n              count = 0\n\n      However, note: i is from 0 to n-1, and k>=1, so i-k+1 might be negative, then we set low=0. Similarly, min(i, n-k) might be less than 0? No, because i>=0 and n-k>=0.\n\n      Let's test with the example:\n\n          i=0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0; high = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count=1.\n          i=1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0; high = min(1,1)=1 -> count=2.\n          i=2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1; high = min(2,1)=1 -> count=1.\n\n      Then total_sleep = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3+8+7=18.\n\n      Another test: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n          total_weeks = 1\n          i=0: low = max(0,0-1+1)=0; high = min(0,0)=0 -> count=1.\n          total_sleep=10, average=10/1=10.\n\n      Another test: n=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n          total_weeks=3\n          We have three weeks: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]\n          total_sleep = 6 + 9 + 12 = 27.\n          Now by the method:\n            i0: [1] -> count = max(0,0-3+1)=0 to min(0,5-3)=min(0,2)=0 -> count=1 -> 1*1=1\n            i1: [2] -> count = max(0,1-3+1)=max(0,-1)=0 to min(1,2)=1 -> count=2 -> 2*2=4\n            i2: [3] -> count = max(0,2-3+1)=0 to min(2,2)=2 -> count=3 -> 3*3=9\n            i3: [4] -> count = max(0,3-3+1)=1 to min(3,2)=2 -> count=2 -> 4*2=8\n            i4: [5] -> count = max(0,4-3+1)=2 to min(4,2)=2 -> count=1 -> 5*1=5\n          total_sleep=1+4+9+8+5=27. Correct.\n\n      But wait: the third week is [3,4,5] so the element 3 is in the first and second and third week? Actually, the first week: [1,2,3] -> 3 is included, second week: [2,3,4] -> 3 is included, third week: [3,4,5] -> 3 is included. So 3 should be included 3 times. But our calculation for i2 (which is the third element, value 3) gives 3. Similarly, the element 4 is in the second and third week (count=2). The element 5 is only in the third week (count=1). The element 1 is only in the first week (count=1). The element 2 is in the first and second week (count=2). \n\n      So the method works.\n\n  However, note: the above condition for the count might be simplified.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      count = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1)   ? \n\n  Let me check with i=0: min(1, n, k, n-k+1) -> but n and k are given, and for i=0: \n        count should be 1. \n        min(1, n, k, n-k+1) -> 1 is the minimum, so 1. Correct.\n\n  i=1: \n        min(2, n-1, k, n-k+1) -> 2, but in our example n=3, k=2, then min(2, 2, 2, 2)=2. Correct.\n\n  i=2: \n        min(3, 1, 2, 2) -> 1. But wait, the count for i=2 was 1. Correct.\n\n  How about i=3 in the example n=5, k=3:\n        i=3: min(4, 5-3=2, 3, 5-3+1=3) -> min(4,2,3,3)=2. Correct.\n\n  But wait, why is the count for i=3 (which is the fourth element, 0-indexed) equal to 2? \n        The element at index3 (value4) is in the second and third week. Correct.\n\n  How about the general reasoning for the count?\n\n      The element at index i is included in:\n        - The first week that covers it: the earliest week that ends at i must start at i-k+1 (if we don't consider the boundaries) but the week must start at or after 0.\n        - The last week that covers it: the latest week that starts at n-k (so the week ends at n-1) must start at i (if i <= n-k) or at n-k (if i > n-k). \n\n      Actually, the element i is included in a week if the week starts at j and j <= i and j >= i-k+1, and j>=0, j<=n-k.\n\n      The maximum j that can cover i is i (if i<=n-k) or n-k (if i>n-k). The minimum j is max(0, i-k+1).\n\n      Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n      Alternatively, we can express the count as:\n\n          count = min(i+1, n-i, k)   ??? \n\n      Wait, no: because the element i is covered by a week if the week starts at j, and the week must be of length k, so the week must extend from j to j+k-1. The condition for including i is j<=i<=j+k-1.\n\n      Rearranged: j>=i-k+1 and j<=i.\n\n      But also j must be in [0, n-k].\n\n      So the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(i-k+1, 0) + 1.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          count = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1)   [doesn't work for the example n=3, k=2, i=0: min(1,3,2,2)=1 -> ok, i=1: min(2,2,2,2)=2 -> ok, i=2: min(3,1,2,2)=1 -> ok]\n\n      Why does min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) work?\n\n          i+1: the maximum number of weeks that can start from the beginning to i (if we didn't have the week length constraint) is i+1.\n          n-i: the maximum number of weeks that can end by the end of the array from i onward? Actually, the condition from the end: the last week that includes i is the one that ends at n-1, so the start of that week is n-k. But wait, the element i is included in a week that starts at j and j<=i. The week must end at j+k-1, which must be <= n-1 -> j<=n-k. So the condition on j is j<=min(i, n-k). \n\n      Actually, the count is: \n          count = min(i+1, n-i, k)   [without n-k+1] doesn't work for the example n=5, k=3, i=3:\n          min(4, 2, 3) = 2 -> correct.\n\n      But wait, why is the week length k not limiting the count? \n\n      Actually, the condition from the week length is that the week must start at j>=i-k+1. So the maximum j is i (if i<=n-k) or n-k (if i>n-k). The minimum j is max(0, i-k+1). Then the count is the number of integers in [max(0,i-k+1), min(i, n-k)].\n\n      But note: the condition from the week length is already incorporated in the lower bound (i-k+1) and the condition from the array boundaries (n-k) is the upper bound.\n\n      However, the count is independent of the total number of weeks? Actually, the total number of weeks is n-k+1, but the count for an element is the number of weeks that include it, which is the same as the number of valid j.\n\n      But note: the condition \"n-i\" doesn't appear in the bounds for j. \n\n      Let me reexamine: \n\n          The week must start at j and j<=i (to cover i) and j>=0 and j<=n-k (because the week must fit in the array). Additionally, the week must have length k, so j<=i and j>=i-k+1.\n\n      So the conditions are:\n\n          j in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)]\n\n      Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n      We can write:\n\n          total_sleep = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              high = min(i, n - k)\n              if low <= high:\n                  count_i = high - low + 1\n              else:\n                  count_i = 0\n              total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n      Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n  This is O(n) and uses minimal memory.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the week to fit in the array is that the week must start at j and j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j<=n-k, so the condition is j<=n-k, which we have.\n\n  Let's test with the example n=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,4,5]:\n\n      i0: low = max(0,0-3+1)=0, high = min(0,5-3)=min(0,2)=0 -> count=1\n      i1: low = max(0,1-3+1)=0, high = min(1,2)=1 -> count=2\n      i2: low = max(0,2-3+1)=0, high = min(2,2)=2 -> count=3\n      i3: low = max(0,3-3+1)=1, high = min(3,2)=2 -> count=2\n      i4: low = max(0,4-3+1)=2, high = min(4,2)=2 -> count=1\n\n      Then total_sleep = 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*2 + 5*1 = 1+4+9+8+5=27.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  But note: the condition for the week to cover i is that the week must start at j and j<=i and j>=i-k+1. However, the week must also end at j+k-1 <= n-1, which is equivalent to j<=n-k (because the last week starts at n-k, and then the week ends at n-k+k-1 = n-1). So we have two constraints: j<=i and j<=n-k, and j>=i-k+1.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n      if total_weeks == 0:\n          # Actually, k<=n so total_weeks>=1, so this is safe.\n          print(\"0.0000000000\")\n      else:\n          total_sleep = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # Calculate the range of j (start indices of the week) that include a[i]\n              low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              high = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at i and at most at n-k (the last week)\n              if low <= high:\n                  count_i = high - low + 1\n              else:\n                  count_i = 0\n              total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n          average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n          # Format the output to have 10 decimal places\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  However, note: the example n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> total_weeks=1, and i=0: low = max(0,0-1+1)=0, high=min(0,0)=0 -> count=1, total_sleep=10, average=10.0.\n\n  But wait, the example input \"1 1\\n10\" expects \"10.0000000000\", so this is correct.\n\n  But note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives 9.0.\n\n  However, the example input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" gives 28964.2857142857.\n\n  Let's verify with the second method for the third example:\n\n      n=8, k=2, so total_weeks=7.\n\n      We need to compute the total_sleep by counting for each element:\n\n        a = [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\n        i0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high = min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1, add 1*1\n        i1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high = min(1,6)=1 -> count=2, add 2*2\n        i2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high = min(2,6)=2 -> count=2, add 4*2\n        i3: low = max(0,3-2+1)=2, high = min(3,6)=3 -> count=2, add 100000*2\n        i4: low = max(0,4-2+1)=3, high = min(4,6)=4 -> count=2, add 123*2\n        i5: low = max(0,5-2+1)=4, high = min(5,6)=5 -> count=2, add 456*2\n        i6: low = max(0,6-2+1)=5, high = min(6,6)=6 -> count=2, add 789*2\n        i7: low = max(0,7-2+1)=6, high = min(7,6)=6 -> count=1, add 1*1\n\n        total_sleep = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n\n        Let me calculate:\n\n          1+4 = 5\n          5+8=13\n          13+200000=200013\n          200013+246=200259\n          200259+912=201171\n          201171+1578=202749\n          202749+1=202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Which matches the example.\n\n  Therefore, we'll use the second method.\n\n  However, note: the above method is O(n) and n can be up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the problem statement says \"In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\" and we are formatting to 10 digits.\n\n  We can use:\n\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  This will output the number with 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n  However, sometimes floating point might cause representation issues, but the numbers are integers and the division is exact if the total_sleep is divisible by total_weeks, otherwise we get a repeating decimal. But the formatting will handle that.\n\n  One more thing: the constraints on a[i] (up to 10^5) and n,k (up to 200000) means that total_sleep can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 * (at most k) -> maximum k is 200000, so worst-case total_sleep could be 200000 * 10^5 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are dividing by an integer and then formatting a float). However, to avoid floating point inaccur",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as any contiguous subarray of length `k` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all such weeks and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to compute the average sleep time over all contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length `k` in the given sequence. The challenge is to do this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force method that would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Intuition**: For each element in the sequence, determine how many weeks include it. This count depends on its position and the value of `k`. Specifically, an element at position `i` will be included in weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The total sleep time is the sum of each element multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of processing each week individually, we leverage the observation that each element's contribution to the total sleep time can be calculated based on its position. This approach reduces the problem to a linear pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element exactly once, leading to an O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5). The space complexity is O(n) to store the input array, but no additional significant data structures are used.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sleep = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high = min(i, n - k)\n        if low <= high:\n            count_i = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the week length `k`, and the sequence of sleep times.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If there are no valid weeks (though constraints ensure `k <= n`, it's handled for safety), the result is set to 0.\n3. **Total Sleep Calculation**: For each element in the sequence, compute how many weeks include it by determining the valid range of starting indices for those weeks. The element's value is then multiplied by this count and added to the total sleep time.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sleep time is divided by the number of weeks to get the average, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging positional analysis, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
