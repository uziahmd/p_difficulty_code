The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000) and we have n+2 towns from 0 to n+1.\n We build a tower in each town i (for i from 1 to n) with probability 1/2 independently.\n\n Conditions:\n  - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n  - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one tower.\n\n How the signal works: A tower at town i with signal power p covers all towns c such that |c-i| < p.\n\n Note: The signal power must be an integer from 1 to n.\n\n Observation:\n\n For a tower at town i to cover a town j, we need |j-i| < p. Since p is at least 1, then for j=i, we must have 0 < p (which is always true). But note that the condition for covering a town j is that the distance is strictly less than p.\n\n We require that:\n   - Town 0: no signal. So no tower can cover town 0. The towers are only built in towns 1..n, so the condition for a tower at i to cover town 0 is |0-i| < p -> i < p. Therefore, if there is a tower at i, then we must set its power p such that p <= i (so that i < p fails). However, note that we can set p arbitrarily from 1 to n, so if we set p <= i, then it won't cover town 0.\n\n Similarly, for town n+1: |n+1 - i| < p -> (n+1-i) < p. To avoid covering, we must have p <= n+1-i.\n\n Additionally, we require that each town j (from 1 to n) gets covered by exactly one tower.\n\n Let's think about what constraints the requirement for towns 1 to n imposes.\n\n Consider a town j (1<=j<=n). It must be covered by exactly one tower. Which towers can cover it?\n   - From a tower at i, we require |j-i| < p. This means that the tower at i must be within (p-1) steps from j. But note we can choose p arbitrarily (from 1 to n) as long as the conditions for other towns are satisfied.\n\n However, note that we have two fixed constraints (towns 0 and n+1) and the requirement for each town j (1<=j<=n) to be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n Another way to look at it: \n\n We can assign each town j (from 1 to n) to a tower. But note that the same tower might be able to cover multiple towns, but we require exactly one per town.\n\n Moreover, the condition that town 0 and n+1 are not covered imposes restrictions on the towers:\n\n   - For a tower at i, to not cover town 0, we must set p <= i.\n   - For a tower at i, to not cover town n+1, we must set p <= n+1-i.\n\n Therefore, the maximum power we can assign to a tower at i is min(i, n+1-i).\n\n Now, consider that the assignment of powers must also ensure that the coverage of each town j is exactly one.\n\n How to assign? We can try to assign each town j to a tower i, and then set the power of that tower so that it covers j and does not cover j's neighbors in a way that breaks the condition.\n\n But note: if we assign two consecutive towns to the same tower, then the power must be set to at least (distance from the tower to the farther town plus one) to cover both? Actually, wait: the condition is that the tower at i with power p covers all c with |c-i| < p. So if we want to cover two towns j and k (with j < k) then we require:\n   - For j: k - i < p   [if k is to the right] but actually we don't know the positions. Alternatively, we can think of the entire set of towns that a tower can cover.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the tower covers only the assigned town. In fact, the condition is that each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower, but a tower might cover more than one town. But then those extra towns must be assigned to that same tower? No, because then they would be covered by two towers (the one they are assigned to and the one that accidentally covers them). \n\n Actually, the condition is strict: each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower. Therefore, if a tower covers more than one town, then all the towns it covers must be assigned to it. But note: we are free to assign the power arbitrarily (from 1 to n, but constrained by the two fixed conditions). However, the problem does not require that the assignment of which tower covers which town is predetermined; we can choose the assignment as long as the conditions hold.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We note that the entire set of towns 1..n must be partitioned by the towers. And each tower i can only cover towns that are strictly inside (i, i + p) and (i - p, i) but note the condition is |c-i|<p. Also, the power p is bounded by min(i, n+1-i) (because we must not cover 0 and n+1).\n\n Moreover, the coverage of a tower i with power p is the interval [i-p+1, i+p-1] (but note: the condition is |c-i| < p, so c from i-p+1 to i+p-1). However, we must not cover 0 and n+1, so the interval must lie entirely in [1, n].\n\n But note: the problem requires that each town j (from 1 to n) is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n Now, consider the following: the entire set of towns 1..n must be covered by the towers that are built. Moreover, the coverage must be non-overlapping? Not necessarily, but the condition says \"exactly one\", so two different towers cannot cover the same town.\n\n Therefore, the union of the intervals (with the chosen powers) must cover [1, n] exactly once.\n\n How can we achieve this? \n\n We can use towers to cover contiguous segments. Notice that the leftmost town is 1 and the rightmost is n.\n\n For a tower at i to be useful, note that:\n\n   - If we use a tower at i, then the maximum coverage it can have (without violating the constraints) is p_max = min(i, n+1-i). Then the coverage is from i - p_max + 1 to i + p_max - 1.\n\n   - However, we can choose p arbitrarily from 1 to p_max.\n\n Now, let's think about the minimal requirement for covering the entire segment [1, n]. We must have:\n\n   - The leftmost tower (if built) must be at town 1. But note: the tower at town 1 can only cover up to town 1 + p_max - 1 = 1 + min(1, n+1-1) - 1 = 1 + min(1, n) - 1. If n>=1, then min(1, n)=1, so it covers from 1-1+1=1 to 1+1-1=1. So it can only cover town 1.\n\n   - Similarly, the tower at town n can only cover town n.\n\n Therefore, to cover town 1, we must have either:\n   - The tower at town 1 is built and set to at least 1 (which is always allowed by the constraint for town 0, because p<=1) and then it will cover town 1 (and possibly others? But wait: for n>=2, the tower at 1 has p_max=1, so only covers town 1).\n   - Or, a tower to the right of town 1 (say at i) must cover town 1. Then we require |1-i| < p. Since i>=2, then |1-i|=i-1, so we require p > i-1. But the constraint for town 0 for the tower at i requires p <= i (from the left side). So the condition for covering town 1 is p >= i (but note: p must be an integer, so p>=i) and from the constraint we have p<=i. Therefore, the only possibility is p=i. Then the coverage of the tower at i is from i-i+1 to i+i-1, i.e., from 1 to 2*i-1.\n\n   However, note: if we use a tower at i (i>=2) to cover town 1, then we set p=i. Then the coverage is from 1 to 2*i-1. But then we must not cover town 0 (which is satisfied because the leftmost point is 1) and we must not cover town n+1: the rightmost point is 2*i-1, and we require 2*i-1 <= n (because if 2*i-1 >= n+1 then we violate the condition for n+1? Actually, the condition for n+1 is that the tower doesn't cover n+1, so 2*i-1 < n+1? Actually, the condition is |n+1-i| < p, which is n+1-i < p (since n+1-i is positive). But p=i, so we require n+1-i < i -> n+1 < 2*i. This condition must hold. Therefore, if we use a tower at i to cover town 1, then we must have 2*i > n+1, i.e., i > (n+1)/2.\n\n   Similarly, for covering the rightmost part, the last town n must be covered by either the tower at n (then set to 1, which only covers n) or by a tower at j < n. Then the condition for covering n is |n-j| < p, and the constraint for n+1 requires p <= n+1-j. Then the condition becomes p > n-j-1 and p <= n+1-j. So p must be n-j+1 (if we want to use the maximum allowed by the constraint, and also meet the coverage). Then the coverage of the tower at j is from j-(n-j+1)+1 to j+(n-j+1)-1, i.e., from 2*j-n to n. But to cover town 1, we might use a tower at i (with i> (n+1)/2) and then the remaining part from 2*i-1+1 to n must be covered by the next tower(s). \n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire [1, n] to be covered by one contiguous segment from a single tower. We can use multiple towers.\n\n After careful thought, note that the problem is symmetric and the constraints are independent for each tower. Moreover, the problem can be broken down by considering the gaps between the towns.\n\n There is a known solution for similar problems (e.g., CodeForces) that uses dynamic programming or combinatorial reasoning. But note the examples:\n\n Example n=2: probability 1/4.\n\n Example n=3: probability 1/4.\n\n Example n=5: probability 5/32.\n\n What is the pattern?\n\n Let f(n) be the probability for given n.\n\n We can think of the process:\n\n   - The entire configuration is determined by which of the n towers (at positions 1..n) are built.\n\n   - The condition for having a valid assignment is that the set of built towers must form a set that can cover the entire segment [1, n] without overlapping and without covering 0 or n+1.\n\n How can we cover [1, n]? \n\n Note: The coverage of a tower i is an interval [L_i, R_i] where L_i = i - p + 1 and R_i = i + p - 1, and p is chosen from 1 to min(i, n+1-i). But we are free to choose p arbitrarily (as long as the constraints hold). However, to satisfy the condition that each town is covered by exactly one tower, the intervals must be disjoint and their union must be [1, n].\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the entire available power. We can choose p arbitrarily (from 1 to min(i, n+1-i)) for each tower. However, the condition for covering a town j by a tower i is that j must be in [i-p+1, i+p-1] and we must assign j to that tower.\n\n Another perspective: \n\n We can consider that the entire segment [1, n] must be partitioned into contiguous intervals, and each interval must be covered by one tower. Moreover, the tower that covers an interval [a, b] must be located at some i (which is in [a, b]) and the power must be set to (i - a + 1) [to cover from a to i] and also (b - i + 1) [to cover from i to b]? Actually, to cover [a, b] with a tower at i, we need:\n\n   - The left part: i - p + 1 <= a  => p >= i - a + 1.\n   - The right part: i + p - 1 >= b  => p >= b - i + 1.\n\n So the required power is at least max(i - a + 1, b - i + 1). Also, the power must be at most min(i, n+1-i) (because of the constraints on 0 and n+1). Therefore, for the tower at i to cover the entire interval [a, b], we require:\n\n   max(i - a + 1, b - i + 1) <= min(i, n+1-i)\n\n But note: the problem does not require that a tower covers a contiguous interval by itself. However, because the condition is that each town is covered by exactly one tower, the coverage of a tower must form a contiguous interval? Actually, yes: because if a tower at i covers two non-adjacent towns, then the towns in between must be covered by that same tower (otherwise, they would be uncovered by any tower, or covered by two). But wait, the condition is that the entire set of towns 1..n must be covered, and if a tower covers two non-adjacent towns, then the coverage is contiguous by the definition of the absolute value condition (if it covers j and k, then it covers every integer between j and k). \n\n Therefore, the coverage of a tower is a contiguous interval. Then the entire [1, n] is partitioned into contiguous intervals, each covered by one tower.\n\n Now, how many ways are there to partition [1, n] into contiguous intervals? And which towers are available (built or not) and what are the constraints on the location of the tower for each interval?\n\n Let the interval be [L, R]. Then the tower must be located at some i in [L, R] and the power p must be at least (max(i-L+1, R-i+1)) and at most min(i, n+1-i). Therefore, for the interval [L, R] to be covered by a tower at i, we require:\n\n   max(i-L+1, R-i+1) <= min(i, n+1-i)\n\n This condition is equivalent to:\n\n   i-L+1 <= min(i, n+1-i)   and   R-i+1 <= min(i, n+1-i)\n\n Note: \n   i-L+1 <= i  => -L+1 <= 0 => L>=1 (which is always true) and i-L+1 <= n+1-i => 2*i <= n+1+L.\n   Similarly, R-i+1 <= i => R+1 <= 2*i, and R-i+1 <= n+1-i => R+1 <= n+1.\n\n The second condition (R+1<=n+1) is always true because R<=n. \n\n So the main constraints for a tower at i to cover [L,R] are:\n\n   2*i >= R+1   and   2*i <= n+1+L.\n\n But note: the tower must be built, and the power must be chosen appropriately.\n\n However, note that we are free to choose the power (within the limits) and the assignment of the intervals to towers. \n\n The key observation is that the entire [1, n] must be partitioned, and the partition must be such that the intervals are aligned with the requirement that the tower for an interval [L, R] must be located in the middle of the interval (or as far as possible from the ends) and must satisfy the above inequalities.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem is symmetric and the minimal requirement for a tower to cover an interval [L, R] is that the tower must be at least at position ceil((L+R)/2). But we also have the constraint from the endpoints (town 0 and n+1).\n\n But note: the examples:\n\n   n=2: \n      Towers at positions 1 and 2. The entire segment [1,2] must be covered.\n\n      Possibilities:\n        - Use tower at 1: then it must cover [1,?] and then the rest [?,2] must be covered by tower at 2. But the tower at 1 can only cover [1,1] (because p<=min(1,3)=1) so then we need to cover [2,2] by tower at 2. But then we require the tower at 2 to have p>=1 (which is okay) and the constraint for n+1 (which is 3) is p<=3-2=1. So p=1, then it covers [2,2]. So that works.\n\n        - Use tower at 2: then similarly, it can only cover [2,2] (since p<=min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1). Then we must cover [1,1] by tower at 1. That works.\n\n        - Use both: then we can assign [1,1] to tower1 and [2,2] to tower2, or assign [1,2] to one of them? \n            - If we assign [1,2] to tower1: then we require p for tower1 to be at least 2 (to cover 2: |2-1|<p -> 1 < p -> p>=2). But the constraint for n+1 (3) requires p<=1 (from the left side: min(1,3)=1). Contradiction.\n            - Similarly, assigning [1,2] to tower2: requires p for tower2 to be at least 2 (to cover 1: |1-2|<p -> 1 < p -> p>=2) but the constraint for n+1 (3) for tower2 is p<=1. Contradiction.\n\n        - Use neither: then [1,2] is not covered -> invalid.\n\n        So the valid configurations are: {tower1 built, tower2 not built} and {tower1 not built, tower2 built}. But wait, we require that every town from 1 to n (which is 1 and 2) is covered. So if we have only one tower, we must cover both? \n\n        Actually, if we have only tower1, then it covers [1,1] (if set to 1) and then town2 is not covered. Similarly, only tower2: covers [2,2] and not [1,1]. Therefore, the only valid configurations are those that use both towers.\n\n        But wait: the example says the answer for n=2 is 1/4. \n\n        There are 2^2 = 4 possibilities. The valid ones are when both are built? Then we can set the signals: \n          Tower1: set to 1 (covers [1,1]), Tower2: set to 1 (covers [2,2]). \n          Then conditions hold: \n            Town0: not covered (since |0-1|=1>=1, |0-2|=2>=1)\n            Town3: not covered (similarly)\n            Town1: covered by tower1, town2: covered by tower2.\n\n        However, if we have both built, we can set the signals as above. But what if we set tower1 to 2? Then it covers [0,2] (which includes 0) -> not allowed. Similarly, we cannot set tower2 to 2 because then it would cover [1,3] (including 0? no, because 0 is at 0 and |0-2|=2 is not <2? Actually, the condition is |c-2|<2 -> c in (0,4), so c=1,2,3. Then town0 is not included (because |0-2|=2 is not <2) but town3 is included. However, we require that town3 (n+1=3) is not covered. So setting tower2 to 2 is not allowed. Therefore, the only valid setting for both built is (1,1). \n\n        Now, what about the case when only one is built? We saw that if only one is built, then one town is not covered. So the only valid configuration is when both are built and set appropriately.\n\n        Therefore, the probability is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4.\n\n   Example n=3:\n\n        We have 3 towers at positions 1,2,3.\n\n        We require to cover [1,3]. \n\n        Consider the possibilities:\n\n          Case 1: All three towers built.\n            We can set:\n              Tower1: must set p<=min(1,4)=1 -> only 1, covers [1,1].\n              Tower3: must set p<=min(3,4-3)=min(3,1)=1 -> only 1, covers [3,3].\n              Then we must cover [2,2] by tower2. For tower2: p<=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2. To cover [2,2] we need p>=1 (which is allowed). But note: if we set p=1, then it covers [2,2]; if we set p=2, then it covers [1,3] (which would then overlap with the other towers). However, the condition is that each town is covered by exactly one tower. So if we set tower2 to 2, then:\n                 Town1: covered by tower1 and tower2 -> invalid.\n                 Similarly, town3: covered by tower3 and tower2 -> invalid.\n              Therefore, we must set tower2 to 1. Then it only covers [2,2]. \n\n            So configuration: (1,1,1) is valid.\n\n          Case 2: Towers at 1 and 2 built, not 3.\n            Then we must cover [1,3]. \n            Tower1: p<=1 -> covers [1,1].\n            Tower2: p<=2 -> must cover [2,3]. To cover 3: |3-2|<p -> 1 < p -> p>=2. Then p=2 (maximum). Then it covers [0,3] (which includes 0) -> not allowed. Because the constraint for 0: |0-2|=2 is not <2? Actually, the condition is |c-2|<2, so c in (0,4). Then 0 is not included (since 0 is not in (0,4) because 0 is the lower bound and we use open interval? Actually, the condition is |c-2| < 2, so c must be in the open interval (0,4). Then 0 is excluded. But then 3 is included (|3-2|=1<2). However, the problem requires that town4 (n+1=4) is not covered. Here, 4 is not included (since |4-2|=2 is not <2). So the coverage of tower2 is [1,3] (since the interval is (0,4) and we are only concerned with integers: 1,2,3). Then town1 is covered by tower1 and tower2, which violates the condition (each town must be covered by exactly one). Therefore, invalid.\n\n          Case 3: Towers at 1 and 3 built, not 2.\n            Then we must cover [1,3]. \n            Tower1: p<=1 -> covers [1,1].\n            Tower3: p<=1 -> covers [3,3].\n            Then we must cover [2,2]. But the only tower available is ... none? Because we didn't build tower2. Therefore, invalid.\n\n          Case 4: Towers at 2 and 3 built, not 1.\n            Then cover [1,3]:\n            Tower3: p<=1 -> covers [3,3].\n            Then we must cover [1,2] by tower2. \n            Tower2: p<=min(2,4-2)=2. To cover [1,2]: \n                For 1: |1-2|=1 < p -> p>=2.\n                Then p=2, which is allowed. Then coverage: (0,4) -> includes 0? No, but wait: the condition for 0 is |0-2|=2, which is not <2 -> okay. For 4: |4-2|=2, not <2 -> okay. Then the coverage of tower2 is [1,3] (integers). Then town1 is covered by tower2, town2 is covered by tower2, town3 is covered by tower3. But then town2 is covered by two towers? No, because tower2 covers [1,3] (so town2 is covered by tower2) and tower3 covers [3,3] (so town3 is covered). But then town1 is covered by tower2 (only) and town2 is covered by tower2 (only) and town3 is covered by tower3 (only). However, wait: the condition requires that each town from 1 to 3 is covered by exactly one tower. \n                But note: the condition for town2: only tower2 covers it. However, the condition for town1: only tower2 covers it. And town3: only tower3 covers it. So it is valid.\n\n            But wait, why did we not use tower1? We didn't build it, so that's fine.\n\n          Case 5: Only one tower built: \n            - Only tower1: covers [1,1] -> then 2 and 3 not covered.\n            - Only tower2: covers [x,y] with p<=2. The maximum coverage is [0,3] (which excludes 0 and 4) but then it covers 1,2,3. Then we have three towns covered by one tower -> each town must be covered by exactly one, so not allowed (unless we set p=1: then only [1,2] (if we set p=1: then [1,2] is covered? Actually, for p=1: [1,2] is not the entire set: the coverage is [2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2] for p=1? Actually, for tower2 with p=1: covers c such that |c-2|<1 -> only c=2. Then we only cover town2. Then towns1 and 3 are not covered. Similarly, if p=2: then [1,3] is covered, but then we have three towns covered by one tower -> invalid.\n            - Only tower3: covers [3,3] -> then 1,2 not covered.\n\n          Case 6: None built: invalid.\n\n        Therefore, the valid configurations are:\n          Case 1: All three built -> valid.\n          Case 4: Towers at 2 and 3 built -> valid.\n\n        How many total configurations? 2^3 = 8.\n\n        So the probability is (1 + 1) / 8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\n        But wait, the example says the answer for n=3 is 1/4.\n\n        Now, what about n=5? The answer is 5/32.\n\n        Total configurations: 2^5 = 32.\n\n        Then the number of valid configurations is 5.\n\n        We must find 5 subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} that satisfy the conditions.\n\n        How to generalize?\n\n        Observation:\n\n        The problem is symmetric. We can consider the entire segment [1, n] and the requirement is to cover it with disjoint contiguous intervals, and each interval [L,R] must be covered by a tower located somewhere in [L,R] and the tower must be built.\n\n        Moreover, the constraints from the endpoints (0 and n+1) imply that the tower at i can only be used to cover an interval that lies entirely within [max(1, i-p+1), min(n, i+p-1)] and p<=min(i, n+1-i). \n\n        However, note that the minimal requirement for an interval [L,R] to be covered by a tower at i is that the tower must be built and the power must be at least max(i-L, R-i) (since |L-i| < p and |R-i| < p, so p must be at least ceil(|L-i|+1) and ceil(|R-i|+1)? Actually, the condition is strict: p > |c-i| for every c in [L,R]. The minimal p is max_{c in [L,R]} (|c-i|+1). But note: the minimal p to cover [L,R] is max(R-i, i-L) + 1? Actually, the condition is |c-i| < p, so for the worst-case c (either L or R) we require p > |c-i|. Then the minimal p is max(|L-i|, |R-i|) + 1.\n\n        But we are constrained by p <= min(i, n+1-i). So the interval [L,R] can be covered by the tower at i if and only if:\n\n            max(|L-i|, |R-i|) + 1 <= min(i, n+1-i)\n\n        However, note that the problem does not require to cover a contiguous interval by a single tower? Actually, we do: because the coverage of a tower is contiguous and the entire [1, n] is partitioned.\n\n        There is a simpler way: consider that the entire [1, n] must be partitioned into intervals, and each interval must be contained in the coverage of one of the built towers (and the power can be chosen arbitrarily as long as the constraints for 0 and n+1 hold). \n\n        But note: the examples and known answers:\n\n          n=1: \n            Towns: 0,1,2.\n            We have one tower at town1 (probability 1/2).\n            Conditions: \n              - Cover town1: must set p>=1 (and p<=min(1,2)=1) so p=1 -> covers [0,2] (by the condition: |c-1|<1 -> c=1 only). \n              - Town0: |0-1|=1 is not <1 -> okay.\n              - Town2: |2-1|=1 is not <1 -> okay.\n            Then the condition for the towns 1..n (which is just town1) is met.\n\n            So the valid configuration is when the tower is built.\n\n            Probability: 1/2.\n\n            But wait, the problem states that for n=2 the answer is 1/4, for n=3 is 1/4, and for n=5 is 5/32.\n\n            However, the sample input ['2','3','5','200000'] outputs ['748683265','748683265','842268673','202370013'].\n\n            We must compute modulo 998244353.\n\n            For n=1: \n                Answer = 1/2 mod 998244353 = (1 * pow(2, -1, 998244353)) % 998244353.\n\n            Let's check: \n                pow(2, -1, 998244353) = 499122177\n                So 1/2 = 499122177.\n\n            But the example outputs for n=2 and n=3 are the same: 748683265.\n\n            We know:\n                n=2: 1/4 -> 1/4 mod 998244353 = pow(4, -1, 998244353) = 748683265? \n                    Let me check: 4 * 748683265 mod 998244353 should be 1.\n                    4 * 748683265 = 2994733060\n                    2994733060 % 998244353 = 1 -> yes.\n\n            Similarly, n=3: 1/4 -> 748683265.\n\n            So the pattern is:\n\n                n=1: 1/2\n                n=2: 1/4\n                n=3: 1/4\n                n=5: 5/32\n\n            This does not look like a simple function of n.\n\n        After reading the note: the real answer for the first example (n=2) is 1/4, and for n=3 is 1/4, and for n=5 is 5/32.\n\n        The problem says: \n          Example n=5: probability 5/32.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for n=1 is 1/2, for n=2 and n=3 is 1/4, and for n=5 is 5/32.\n\n        How to relate n and the probability?\n\n        Let F(n) be the probability.\n\n        We see:\n\n          F(1) = 1/2\n          F(2) = 1/4\n          F(3) = 1/4\n          F(5) = 5/32\n\n        Note: 1/2 = 1/2, 1/4 = 1/4, 1/4 = 1/4, 5/32 = 5/32.\n\n        We note that the denominator is 2^n. So the probability is (number of valid subsets) / (2^n).\n\n        Then:\n\n          n=1: valid_subsets = 1 -> 1/2\n          n=2: valid_subsets = 1 -> 1/4\n          n=3: valid_subsets = 2 -> 2/8 = 1/4\n          n=5: valid_subsets = 5 -> 5/32\n\n        Wait, 2^3=8, so 2/8=1/4. Then the number of valid subsets for n=5 is 5.\n\n        Now, what is the pattern for the count of valid subsets?\n\n          n=1: 1\n          n=2: 1\n          n=3: 2\n          n=5: 5\n\n        This looks familiar: the Fibonacci numbers? \n\n        Let a_n = number of valid subsets for n.\n\n        We have:\n          a_1 = 1\n          a_2 = 1\n          a_3 = 2\n          a_5 = 5\n\n        What is a_4?\n\n        Let n=4:\n\n          We have 4 towers at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n          Conditions: cover [1,4] with disjoint contiguous intervals, each interval [L,R] must be covered by a tower at i (built) and the power p satisfies p<=min(i,5-i) and p>=max(|L-i|,|R-i|)+1 (or rather, the minimal p is max(|L-i|,|R-i|)+1, and we require that <=min(i,5-i)).\n\n          We must consider the valid partitions of [1,4]. The entire [1,4] must be partitioned into contiguous intervals, and each interval must be covered by one of the built towers.\n\n          Possibilities:\n\n          Option 1: One interval [1,4]. Then we need a tower i in [1,4] such that the minimal p (which is max(|1-i|,|4-i|)+1) <= min(i,5-i).\n\n          Let's check i=1: min(1,4)=1; minimal p = max(|1-1|,|4-1|)+1 = max(0,3)+1 = 4. 4<=1? -> no.\n          i=2: min(2,3)=2; minimal p = max(|1-2|,|4-2|)+1 = max(1,2)+1 = 3. 3<=2? -> no.\n          i=3: min(3,2)=2; minimal p = max(|1-3|,|4-3|)+1 = max(2,1)+1 = 3. 3<=2? -> no.\n          i=4: min(4,1)=1; minimal p = max(|1-4|,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (each with a probability of 1/2 independently), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower, and each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower. The solution involves recognizing a pattern in the number of valid configurations and computing the probability modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the valid configurations follow a specific pattern related to Fibonacci numbers. For each n, the number of valid subsets of towns where towers can be built is given by the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number (with F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, etc.). This insight simplifies the problem to counting Fibonacci numbers modulo 998244353.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: Through examples (n=1,2,3,5), we observe that the number of valid configurations for n is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number. For instance:\n   - n=1: 1 valid configuration (Fibonacci number F(0) = 1? Actually, F(0)=0, F(1)=1, so for n=1, it's F(1)=1).\n   - n=2: 1 valid configuration (F(2)=1).\n   - n=3: 2 valid configurations (F(3)=2).\n   - n=5: 5 valid configurations (F(5)=5).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute Fibonacci numbers modulo 998244353 efficiently, especially since n can be as large as 200,000. The dynamic programming approach involves iteratively computing each Fibonacci number up to n, using the recurrence relation F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) mod 998244353.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space (after optimization), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(1 * pow(2, -1, MOD) % MOD)\n        return\n        \n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]) % MOD\n        \n    total_outcomes = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    valid_subsets = fib[n - 1]\n    probability = valid_subsets * pow(total_outcomes, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(probability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer n, read from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If n is 1, the probability is directly computed as 1/2 modulo 998244353.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: For n ≥ 2, we compute the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number modulo 998244353 using dynamic programming. The sequence starts with fib[1] = 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two, modulo 998244353.\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The number of valid configurations is fib[n-1]. The total possible outcomes are 2^n (each tower can be built or not). The probability is then (number of valid configurations) / (total outcomes) modulo 998244353, computed using modular inverse for division.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the probability in the required form.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the observed pattern and modular arithmetic to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
