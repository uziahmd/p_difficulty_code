При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to determine if it can be represented as the result of two consecutive identical messages `s` that were sent but due to an error, they overlapped. The overlapping must be positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The entire string `t` must be the concatenation of two copies of `s` with some overlap (non-zero, but less than len(s)).\n 2. There should not be any error-free situation (like just two copies without overlap) or the case where the entire second copy is overlapped (which is allowed? Actually note: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений\" — meaning that if the entire second copy is overlapped (so the whole `t` is one copy of `s`), then that is not an error. But note the example: if t = \"abcd\", then no error. Similarly, if t = \"abcabc\", then no error (because that would be two copies without overlap? Actually, wait: the problem says \"simple concatenation\" is not an error, and the error happens only when there is an overlap (and the condition for the error is that the two original messages were identical and the overlap was positive and less than the length). \n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n So the idea is that if the string `t` can be split into two parts: \n   t = s + s, but with an overlap (so actually t is s + s[overlap:] and the first part is s, and the second part starts with an overlap of length k (0 < k < len(s)) from the beginning of s?\n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   \"two identical messages\" and then they get overlapped by a positive number of matching characters.\n\n How does that work?\n   Let s be the original message. Then the transmission would have sent s and then s again. But during the second transmission, the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s match, so they get merged: the resulting string is s + s[k:].\n\n Therefore, the entire string t must be of the form: \n   t = s[0: len(s)-k] + s[k:]   [but note: actually the entire first s is sent and then the second s is sent, but the overlapping part is at the end of the first and beginning of the second. So the total length of t is len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n Also note: the problem says the entire string t must be the result. And we are to check if there exists an s such that t is obtained by this process.\n\n Additionally, note that the same s must be used for both messages.\n\n Steps:\n\n We are allowed to output any valid s if there are multiple.\n\n Observation:\n   Since t = s + s[k:], then we know that the length of t must be at least 2 * (length of s) - (overlap k). But also, note that k is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   Let n = len(t). Then we require that there exists an integer k (with 0 < k < n/2) such that:\n      t = A + B, where A is the first part and B is the second part, and |A| = n - k, |B| = k? \n   Actually, no: the structure is that the two messages are each of length m (so s has length m). Then the total length is 2*m - k. So n = 2*m - k, and k in [1, m-1]. Then m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n But note: the entire string t must be explained by two copies of s. So we can try to find an s such that:\n   t = s + s[k:]   and k is in [1, len(s)-1].\n\n Another way: \n   The string t must have a prefix that is equal to a suffix (the overlapping part) of the same length, and that overlapping part must be a prefix of s (which is the first half?) Actually, let's break it down.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string t must be built from two copies of s with an overlap of k. Then we have:\n\n   Let m = len(s). Then the entire string t has length 2*m - k.\n\n   Also, note that the beginning of t is s, and the end of t is s[k:]. \n\n   But also, the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n\n   Moreover, the substring t[m-k:] must equal the substring s[k:].\n\n   How can we relate? \n\n   Let's denote:\n      t = s + s[k:]\n\n   Then, the first m characters of t are s.\n   The next m-k characters of t are s[k:].\n\n   Also, note that the entire t has length 2*m - k, so the second part (s[k:]) has length m - k.\n\n   Therefore, we can express:\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m : m + (m-k)] = s[k:]\n\n   But note: the total length is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k.\n\n   Also, we must have that the overlapping part (the last k of s) is the same as the first k of s. That is, s[-k:] == s[:k].\n\n   Now, how to find s? Note that s must be of length m, and we know that the entire string t is fixed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n   Since t is the result of two copies of s with an overlap of k, then we can say that the first part (of length m) is s, and the second part is s[k:]. But also, the entire string t must be consistent with having been formed by s.\n\n   Another approach: consider that the string t must have a period-like property. Actually, the entire string t must satisfy that the first part (without the last k) is s, and the last part (from the beginning of the second s) is s[k:]. But note that the second part is exactly the tail of s.\n\n   Also, note that the entire string t must be such that if we take the second half (the part that originally was the second s) and remove the overlapping part, we get the beginning of s.\n\n   But here is a key: the string t must be such that if we split it into two parts at some point, the second part is the tail of the first part (with the tail being the overlapping part).\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"if possible, determine a possible value s\".\n\n   Let's reexamine with examples:\n\n   Example 1: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n        This is the example: s = \"abrakadabra\", k=1 or k=4? \n        Actually, if s = \"abrakadabra\", then two copies with no overlap would be \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\". But with an overlap of 1: \n            t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (which matches the example)\n        With an overlap of 4: \n            t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"kadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (also matches)\n\n        But note: the problem says if there is an error, then the entire string t must be the result. And we are to output any s that works.\n\n        However, note that the problem also says: if the string t is simply two copies without error (i.e., no overlap) then that is not an error. But wait, the problem says \"if the entire string t is simply two copies without overlap\" then that is not an error. However, our example t is actually the result of two copies with an overlap. So we must check for the presence of an overlap.\n\n   How do we check?\n\n   Let n = len(t). We know that the length of t must be at least 3 (minimum: two identical letters, then an overlap of 1, so the minimal string would be of length 3: e.g., \"aaa\": \n        s = \"aa\", then two copies: \"aa\" and \"aa\", with overlap of 1: then the result is \"a\" (first a) + \"a\" (second a without the first a) -> \"a\" + \"a\" = \"aa\", which is the same as without error? Actually, wait: \n\n        For s = \"aa\": \n          Without error: two copies: \"aaaa\"\n          With error and overlap of 1: \n            First copy: \"aa\", then the second copy starts with 'a' (the first character of the second copy) which matches the last 'a' of the first copy. So the merged string is \"aa\" (the first copy) and then the second copy without the first character: \"a\", so total \"aaa\".\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"the length of the message\" is the length of s. So in the example, s has length 2, and the merged string has length 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.\n\n        Now, what if t = \"aaa\"? Then we can have s = \"aa\", and k=1.\n\n        However, what if t = \"aaa\" and s = \"a\"? Then two copies of \"a\" would normally be \"aa\", but with an error? Actually, if s=\"a\", then the two copies are \"a\" and \"a\", and the overlap must be positive and less than the length (which is 1). But the condition for k is 1 <= k < 1 -> no solution. So s cannot be \"a\".\n\n        Therefore, for t=\"aaa\", the only possibility is s=\"aa\", k=1.\n\n   But note: the problem says the entire string t must be the result of two identical messages. So we are looking for an s (any) that satisfies the condition.\n\n   Steps to solve:\n\n   1. If the string t is such that it cannot be represented as the concatenation of two copies of some s with an overlap (positive and less than len(s)), then output \"NO\".\n\n   2. Otherwise, output \"YES\" and one possible s.\n\n   How to find s?\n\n   Let m be the length of s. Then the total length of t is 2*m - k, and k is in [1, m-1]. Therefore, m must satisfy: \n        m = (n + k) / 2, and k in [1, m-1]. \n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over possible k (or equivalently over possible m) and see if we can find an s.\n\n   Constraints: n <= 100.\n\n   Another idea: since the entire string t is built by s and then s[k:], then the entire string t must have the property that its first m characters (where m is the length of s) must equal the first m characters of the string formed by taking the first m characters and then the next m-k characters (which is s[k:]) must equal the substring of s starting at index k.\n\n   Also, note that the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n\n   We can consider: \n        Let m be the length of s. Then we must have:\n            t[0:m] = s\n            t[m: m+(m-k)] = s[k:]\n            and s[-k:] == s[:k]\n\n   But note: the entire string t has length n = 2*m - k.\n\n   So m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n   However, we can also consider that the string t must be periodic in a certain way.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   Consider that the entire string t must be divisible by two copies of s with an overlap. Then, we can look for a divisor m of the string such that:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]   (with k = m - len(t[m:]) ???) \n\n   Actually, the length of the second part is n - m, and that must be m - k, so k = 2*m - n - m? Not exactly.\n\n   Let me re-express:\n\n        n = 2*m - k   =>   k = 2*m - n\n\n   Then the condition becomes:\n\n        k = 2*m - n, and we require 0 < k < m.\n\n   Therefore, 0 < 2*m - n < m  =>  n < 2*m < n+m  =>  n < 2*m and 2*m < n+m  =>  m > n and m < n? Wait, let's solve:\n\n        Condition: 0 < 2*m - n < m\n        => 2*m - n > 0  => m > n/2\n        and 2*m - n < m => m < n.\n\n   So m must be in (n/2, n). And k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Then, the string t must be split as:\n        First part: t[0:m] = s\n        Second part: t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n   And we must have s[k:] = t[m:], and also s[-k:] = s[:k] (the overlapping condition).\n\n   But note: from the definition, s = t[0:m], and then the condition for the overlap is that the last k characters of s (which is t[m-k:m]) must equal the first k characters of s (which is t[0:k]). \n\n   However, we don't know m. But note: we have k = 2*m - n, so:\n\n        Condition 1: s = t[0:m]\n        Condition 2: s[k:] = t[m:]\n        Condition 3: s[-k:] == s[:k]   i.e., t[m-k:m] == t[0:k]\n\n   But note: Condition 2: s[k:] is t[0:m][k:], and that must equal t[m:]. \n\n   Also, note that the length of t[m:] is n - m = (2*m - k) - m = m - k, so the length of s[k:] is m - k, which matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can iterate over m from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1 (since m>n/2 and m<n) and check:\n\n        k = 2*m - n\n        Condition 1: k must be positive and less than m (which is ensured by our iteration: m>n/2 => k>0, and m<n => k = 2*m-n < 2*(n)-n = n, but we also require k < m? Actually, from the condition above: we set k=2*m-n and then we require k < m, which is equivalent to m < n (which we have) and k>0 (which we have). But note: the condition for the problem requires k < m, and we have k = 2*m-n, so 2*m-n < m => m < n, which is already satisfied because m < n. So we don't need to check k < m separately.\n\n        Then check:\n            (a) s = t[0:m]\n            (b) s[k:] == t[m:]   [the second part of t]\n            (c) s[-k:] == t[0:k]   [the overlapping part: the last k of s must equal the first k of s, and note that the first k of s is t[0:k] and the last k of s is t[m-k:m]]\n\n   But wait, condition (c) is automatically implied by the way we split? Actually, no. Condition (c) is independent. However, note that condition (b) uses the fact that the second part of t is the tail of s (starting at k). \n\n   However, condition (c) is about the overlapping: the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n\n   But note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the first copy is s, and the second copy starts with the first k characters (which must match the last k of the first copy). So condition (c) is necessary.\n\n   But note: condition (b) and (c) are independent? Actually, condition (c) is about the internal structure of s, and condition (b) is about the alignment of the two copies.\n\n   However, we can also derive condition (c) from condition (b)? Not necessarily.\n\n   Example: \n        t = \"aaa\", then n=3.\n        m must be in (1.5, 3) -> m=2 or 3? But m must be integer and less than n (which is 3) so m=2.\n        Then k = 2*2 - 3 = 1.\n        Condition (a): s = t[0:2] = \"aa\"\n        Condition (b): s[1:] = \"a\", and t[2:] = \"a\" (because t[0:2] is \"aa\", then t[2:] is the third character, which is \"a\"). So condition (b) holds.\n        Condition (c): s[-1:] = \"a\", and s[:1] = \"a\", so condition (c) holds.\n\n   Now, what if we try m=3? But m must be less than n (3<3 is false) so we don't consider.\n\n   Example 2: t = \"acacacaca\", output \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n        Let's check: \n            n = 9.\n            m must be in (4.5, 9) so m from 5 to 8.\n\n            Let m=5: k=2*5-9=1.\n                s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n                Condition (b): s[1:] = \"acaca\"[1:] = \"caca\", and t[5:] = t[5:9] = \"caca\" -> matches.\n                Condition (c): s[-1:] = \"a\", and s[:1] = \"a\" -> matches.\n\n            So s = \"acaca\" is valid.\n\n        Alternatively, m=6: k=2*6-9=3.\n                s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n                Condition (b): s[3:] = \"ac\", and t[6:] = t[6:9] = \"aca\" -> \"ac\" != \"aca\", fails.\n\n            m=7: k=2*7-9=5 -> s = t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then s[5:]=\"ca\", t[7:]=\"ca\" (from \"acacacaca\") -> matches. Then condition (c): s[-5:]=\"caca\", s[:5]=\"acaca\" -> \"caca\" != \"acaca\", fails.\n\n            m=8: k=2*8-9=7 -> s=t[0:8]=\"acacacac\", then s[7:]=\"c\", t[8:]=\"a\" -> fails.\n\n        So only m=5 works.\n\n   Example 3: t = \"abcabc\", output \"NO\"\n\n        n=6.\n        m must be in (3,6) -> m=4,5.\n\n        m=4: k=2*4-6=2.\n            s = t[0:4]=\"abcabc\"[:4] = \"abca\"\n            Condition (b): s[2:]=\"ca\", and t[4:]=\"bc\" -> \"ca\" != \"bc\", fail.\n\n        m=5: k=2*5-6=4.\n            s = t[0:5]=\"abcab\"\n            Condition (b): s[4:]=\"b\", and t[5:]=\"c\" -> \"b\" != \"c\", fail.\n\n        So no m found, so output \"NO\".\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"abcabc\" is not an error. This matches because we cannot represent it as two copies of an s with an overlap.\n\n   But wait: what if we consider that the two copies might be of a different s? The problem states: two identical messages. So the two copies must be the same s.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        Let m_min = floor(n/2) + 1   (since m>n/2, then m_min = ceil((n+1)/2) ? Actually, m_min = floor(n/2)+1 is the smallest integer greater than n/2.\n        Let m_max = n-1\n\n        For m in range(m_min, m_max+1):\n            k = 2*m - n\n            if k <= 0:  # though by our range m_min ensures k>=1, but still check?\n                continue\n\n            # Check condition (b): the second part of t (from index m to the end) must be equal to s[k:] (where s = t[0:m])\n            s = t[:m]\n            if len(s) != m:\n                continue\n\n            # The second part of t is from index m to the end, which has length n-m = (2*m - k) - m = m - k.\n            part2 = t[m:]\n\n            # Condition (b): s[k:] must equal part2.\n            if s[k:] != part2:\n                continue\n\n            # Condition (c): the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n            if s[-k:] != s[:k]:\n                continue\n\n            # Then we found a candidate s.\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            exit(0)\n\n        # If no m found, then no error.\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: is condition (c) necessary? Actually, condition (c) is required by the problem: the overlapping part must match. However, note that condition (b) already uses the fact that the second part of t is the tail of s (from index k). But condition (c) is about the entire s: the last k characters of s must be the same as the first k, which is the beginning of the next copy.\n\n   However, condition (c) is independent of condition (b). It is a separate requirement.\n\n   But note: condition (c) is automatically satisfied by the way the message was transmitted? Yes, because the two copies are the same s, and the overlapping part is the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy, so they must be the same.\n\n   However, in our algorithm, we are checking condition (c) separately.\n\n   But note: the example t = \"aaa\" worked.\n\n   Let me test with a tricky one:\n\n        t = \"ababa\"\n        n=5, m_min = floor(5/2)+1 = 2+1=3, m_max=4.\n\n        m=3: k=2*3-5=1.\n            s = t[0:3] = \"aba\"\n            Condition (b): s[1:] = \"ba\", t[3:] = \"ba\" -> matches.\n            Condition (c): s[-1:] = \"a\", s[:1] = \"a\" -> matches.\n\n        So we output YES and \"aba\".\n\n        But is that correct? \n            Two copies of \"aba\" with an overlap of 1: \n                First copy: \"aba\"\n                Second copy: \"aba\" -> without the first character of the second copy (because we overlapped by 1) we get \"aba\" (the first copy) + \"ba\" (the second copy without the first 'a') -> \"ababa\", which matches.\n\n        However, note that there is another representation? \n            What if we consider s=\"ababa\"? Then m=5, but m must be less than n (which is 5) so m=5 is not allowed (since m_max=4). \n\n        So the algorithm outputs \"aba\", which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: what if the string t is \"abcdeabcde\" (two copies without overlap) and we try to see if it can be represented with an error? \n\n        n=10, m_min=5, m_max=9.\n\n        m=5: k=2*5-10=0 -> skip (because k must be positive) [we are skipping k<=0? Actually, in the loop we set k=2*m-n, and if k<=0 we continue. But our m_min is defined as floor(n/2)+1, so for n=10, m_min=5, then k=0 -> skip. Then m=6: k=2*6-10=2.\n            s = t[0:6] = \"abcdeabcde\"[0:6] = \"abcded\"? Actually, wait, t=\"abcdeabcde\", so the first 6 characters are \"abcdea\", then condition (b): s[2:] = \"cdeabcde\" (wait, no: s=\"abcdea\", then s[2:] is \"cdea\", and t[6:] is \"bcde\" (from index6 to the end) -> \"bcde\" vs \"cdea\" -> not equal.\n\n        m=7: k=4, s=\"abcdeabc\", then s[4:]=\"eabc\", t[7:]=\"cde\" -> no.\n\n        m=8: k=6, s=\"abcdeabc\", wait m=8: s=\"abcdeabcd\", then s[6:]=\"abcd\", t[8:]=\"de\" -> no.\n\n        m=9: k=8, s=\"abcdeabcde\"[:9]=\"abcdeabcd\", then s[8:]=\"d\", t[9:]=\"e\" -> no.\n\n        So correctly, \"abcdeabcde\" is not recognized as an error.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that without error (i.e., two copies without overlap) is not an error. But the condition for the error requires an overlap (so k>=1). Therefore, our algorithm correctly ignores two copies without overlap.\n\n   But wait: what if the string t is \"abcabc\", which is two copies of \"abc\" without overlap, but note: \n        n=6, m_min=3, m_max=5.\n\n        m=3: k=0 -> skip.\n        m=4: k=2, s=\"abca\", then s[2:]=\"ca\", t[4:]=\"bc\" -> not equal.\n        m=5: k=4, s=\"abcab\", then s[4:]=\"b\", t[5:]=\"c\" -> not equal.\n\n   So \"abcabc\" is correctly output as \"NO\".\n\n   But note: there is a possibility that the same string t can be represented by two different s? The problem says: output any.\n\n   However, we must also consider: what if there are multiple m that work? Then we can output any.\n\n   Example: t = \"abababab\", n=8.\n\n        m_min = floor(8/2)+1 = 4+1=5, m_max=7.\n\n        m=5: k=2*5-8=2.\n            s = t[0:5] = \"ababa\" (from \"abababab\")\n            Condition (b): s[2:] = \"aba\", t[5:] = \"bab\" -> \"aba\" != \"bab\", fail.\n\n        m=6: k=4, s=\"ababab\", then s[4:]=\"ab\", t[6:]=\"ab\" -> matches.\n            Condition (c): s[-4:]==\"baba\", s[:4]==\"abab\" -> \"baba\" != \"abab\", fail.\n\n        m=7: k=6, s=\"abababa\", then s[6:]=\"a\", t[7:]=\"b\" -> fail.\n\n        So no solution? But wait, the example output for \"abababab\" is \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n        Let me check: \n            They say: s = \"ababab\", and k=4? Then the merged string should be s + s[4:] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is t.\n\n        But wait, the condition (c) requires that the last k (4) of s equals the first k (4) of s. \n            s = \"ababab\", first 4: \"abab\", last 4: \"abab\" -> they are equal! \n\n        Why did our condition (c) fail? \n\n        In our code for m=6: \n            s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n            Condition (b): s[4:] = \"ab\", and t[6:] = \"ab\" (from \"abababab\") -> matches.\n            Condition (c): s[-4:] = s[2:6] = \"abab\", and s[:4] = \"abab\" -> matches.\n\n        So why did I write above that condition (c) failed? \n\n        Correction: \n            Condition (c): s[-k:] = s[-4:] -> from index 6-4=2 to the end: \"ababab\"[2:6] = \"abab\", and s[:4] = \"abab\" -> yes, they are equal.\n\n        Then why did I say \"baba\"? I miscounted the indices.\n\n        Let me recalc for s=\"ababab\":\n            s[-4:] means from index 6-4=2 to the end: \"ababab\"[2:6] = \"abab\".\n            s[:4] is \"abab\".\n\n        So condition (c) passes.\n\n        Then why did I write above that condition (c) fails? Because I thought s[-4:] is \"baba\", but that is incorrect. \n\n        Therefore, the algorithm should output for t=\"abababab\": \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n        But wait, let me run the algorithm step-by-step for m=6:\n\n            t = \"abababab\", n=8, m=6, k=2*6-8=4.\n\n            s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n\n            Condition (b): s[4:] = \"ab\", and t[6:] = \"ab\" -> true.\n\n            Condition (c): s[-4:] = \"abab\", s[:4] = \"abab\" -> true.\n\n        So it passes.\n\n        Then why did I say above that condition (c) fails? I must have made a mistake.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input includes \"tatbt\" -> output \"NO\".\n\n        t = \"tatbt\", n=5.\n        m_min = 3, m_max=4.\n\n        m=3: k=1, s=\"tat\"\n            Condition (b): s[1:] = \"at\", t[3:] = \"bt\" -> \"at\" != \"bt\", fail.\n        m=4: k=3, s=\"tati\", then s[3:]=\"i\", t[4:]=\"t\" -> \"i\" != \"t\", fail.\n\n        So outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   One more edge: minimal string.\n\n        t = \"aaa\", n=3, m_min=2, m_max=2.\n        m=2: k=1, s=\"aa\", condition (b): s[1:]=\"a\", t[2:]=\"a\" -> true.\n        condition (c): s[-1:]=\"a\", s[:1]=\"a\" -> true.\n\n        So output \"YES\\naa\".\n\n   But note: the problem says that the entire string t must be the result of two identical messages. In this case, the two identical messages are \"aa\", and the error occurred with k=1. \n\n   However, what if we consider s=\"a\"? Then two copies of \"a\" would be \"aa\" without error, and with error we require k in [1,0) -> none, so s=\"a\" is not allowed. But our algorithm found s=\"aa\", which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        m_min = (n // 2) + 1   # floor division then add 1, because if n is even, floor(n/2)=n//2, then m_min = n//2+1; if odd, floor(n/2)= (n-1)//2, then m_min = (n-1)//2+1 = (n+1)//2 (ceiling of n/2). But note: we want m>n/2, so for even n: m_min = n/2+1, for odd n: m_min = (n+1)/2 (which is the ceiling). Actually, for n=5: floor(5/2)=2, then m_min=3, which is (5+1)//2=3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: m_min = (n+1)//2  (ceiling of n/2) but then for even n: ceil(6/2)=3, which is correct.\n\n        Actually, we require m_min = floor(n/2)+1, and for even n: floor(n/2)=n/2, so m_min = n/2+1, which is the same as ceil(n/2)+? \n\n        But note: \n            For n=6: floor(6/2)=3, then m_min=4, which is ceil(6/2)=3? no, ceil(6/2)=3, but we need m_min=4.\n\n        Actually, we need m>n/2. For even n: n/2 is integer, so m_min = n/2+1. For odd n: n/2 is not integer, floor(n/2)= (n-1)/2, then m_min=(n-1)/2+1 = (n+1)/2.\n\n        We can compute m_min = (n+1)//2 + (1 if n % 2 == 0 else 0) doesn't look straightforward.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set m_min = (n+1)//2 + 1? For n=6: (6+1)//2=3, then +1 gives 4 -> correct. For n=5: (5+1)//2=3, then +1 gives 4 -> but for n=5, we need m_min=3, so that doesn't work.\n\n        Let me define m_min = (n+1)//2 + (0 if n%2==1 else 0) doesn't help.\n\n        Actually, we can use: m_min = (n+1)//2 + (0 if n%2==1 else 1) ?\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            m_min = (n+1) // 2\n            But then for n=6: (6+1)//2=3, but we need 4.\n\n        Let's stick to: m_min = (n//2) + 1   (using integer floor division)\n\n        For n=5: 5//2=2, then m_min=3 -> correct.\n        For n=6: 6//2=3, then m_min=4 -> correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        m_min = n//2 + 1\n        m_max = n-1\n\n        for m in range(m_min, m_max+1):\n            k = 2*m - n\n            if k <= 0:\n                continue\n\n            s = t[:m]\n            part2 = t[m:]\n\n            # Condition (b): the tail of s (from index k to the end) must be part2.\n            if s[k:] == part2:\n                # Condition (c): the last k of s must equal the first k of s.\n                if s[-k:] == s[:k]:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    print(s)\n                    exit(0)\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the condition (c) is redundant? Because the problem requires that the two copies are identical and the overlapping part must match. But condition (b) doesn't require that the overlapping part (the first k of s) is equal to the last k of s. Condition (b) only requires that the second part (which is the tail of s) is part2. \n\n   But the problem's error mechanism requires that the overlapping part (the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy) are the same. So condition (c) is necessary.\n\n   However, note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the second copy must start with the same k characters as the end of the first copy. But condition (b) does not enforce that. Condition (b) only enforces that the second part of t (which is the rest of the second copy after the overlapping part) is the tail of s (from index k). \n\n   But the beginning of the second copy (the first k characters) must be the same as the end of the first copy (the last k characters). However, in our construction, the second copy is s, and we are using the entire s for the second copy. But the error merges the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy. Therefore, the second copy's first k characters must be the same as the first copy's last k, which is the condition (c). \n\n   But note: condition (b) is about the part after the overlapping. The problem doesn't require anything about the beginning of the second copy beyond the overlapping? Actually, the entire second copy is s, and the overlapping is the first k characters. The rest of the second copy",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be a positive number of characters less than the length of `s`. The solution involves checking all possible lengths of `s` that could produce `t` through such an overlap and verifying the necessary conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two copies of `s` where the second copy overlaps the first by `k` characters (0 < k < length of `s`). The total length of `t` will then be `2*len(s) - k`.\n2. **Insight**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, we can compute the required overlap `k` as `2*m - len(t)`. We then check if `k` is positive and less than `m`. \n3. **Conditions Check**: For each candidate `m`, we split `t` into two parts: the first part is `s` (first `m` characters), and the second part is the remaining characters. We verify two conditions:\n   - The tail of `s` starting from index `k` must match the second part of `t`.\n   - The last `k` characters of `s` must match the first `k` characters of `s` (ensuring the overlap is valid).\n4. **Efficiency**: Given the constraint that the length of `t` does not exceed 100, the approach efficiently checks all possible values of `m` in linear time relative to the length of `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    m_min = n // 2 + 1\n    m_max = n - 1\n    \n    for m in range(m_min, m_max + 1):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k <= 0 or k >= m:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:m]\n        part2 = t[m:]\n        \n        if s[k:] == part2 and s[-k:] == s[:k]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            return\n            \n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The minimum and maximum possible lengths (`m_min` and `m_max`) for `s` are calculated based on the length of `t`.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each candidate length `m` from `m_min` to `m_max`:\n   - **Overlap Calculation**: Compute `k` as `2*m - n`. If `k` is not positive or not less than `m`, skip to the next candidate.\n   - **String Splitting**: Split `t` into `s` (first `m` characters) and `part2` (remaining characters).\n   - **Condition Checks**: Verify if the tail of `s` (starting at `k`) matches `part2` and if the last `k` characters of `s` match the first `k` characters (ensuring valid overlap).\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`. If no valid `s` is found after all checks, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways `t` could be formed by overlapping two identical strings, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
