A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning of the variables:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters in each bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: number of slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (for one friend)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast (for one friend)\n\n Conditions for a toast for one friend: \n   - nl milliliters of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Then, the maximum number of toasts that can be made from the drink is: total_drink // (nl * n) \n    But wait: actually, each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend? \n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n This means: For one toast, we need:\n   - Drink: n * nl (because there are n friends, each requiring nl milliliters for that toast)\n   - Lime slices: n (each friend gets one slice per toast)\n   - Salt: n * np (each friend requires np grams of salt per toast)\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as: \n   - Each friend makes a toast, so for t toasts per friend, we need:\n        Drink: t * nl * n\n        Lime slices: t * n\n        Salt: t * np * n\n\n However, note that the problem says they all drink the same amount. And the goal is to make as many toasts as they can.\n\n So, the limiting factors are:\n\n   From drink: total_drink / (nl * n)   -> this gives the maximum number of toasts per friend (if we ignore other constraints)\n   From limes: total_lime_slices / n    -> because each toast requires one slice per friend (so per toast, we use n slices). \n        total_lime_slices = c * d\n        So, the maximum toasts per friend from limes: (c * d) // n   [but wait, no: we have total_lime_slices = c*d, and we need n slices per toast (for the entire group for one toast). \n        Actually, for t toasts, we need t * n slices. Therefore, the maximum t from limes is (c*d) // n? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n   Total slices = c * d.\n   Each toast uses n slices (one for each friend).\n   So, the maximum number of toasts (for the whole group) from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n   Similarly, for drink: total_drink = k*l, and each toast uses n*nl milliliters, so maximum toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n*nl).\n\n   For salt: total_salt = p, and each toast uses n*np grams, so maximum toasts from salt is p // (n*np).\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the number of toasts each friend can make. But the above calculations are for the entire group.\n\n But wait, if we let T be the number of toasts per friend, then the entire group will have T*n toasts? \n\n Actually, no: each toast is for one round that involves every friend. So if each friend makes T toasts, then the total number of toasts (rounds) is T.\n\n But the condition is: each toast (each round) requires:\n   - n * nl milliliters of drink\n   - n slices of lime\n   - n * np grams of salt\n\n Therefore, the maximum T (toasts per round) is limited by:\n\n   T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   T <= (c * d) / n\n   T <= p / (n * np)\n\n Then, the answer is the floor of the minimum of these three values? But note: the problem says \"each friend\" can make T toasts, meaning T rounds.\n\n However, note that the example:\n\n Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n Breakdown:\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n   Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml.\n   Drink requirement per toast (for the entire",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally in each toast.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, lime slices, and salt for all friends. Specifically:\n   - **Drink**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so for `n` friends, it's `n * nl` milliliters.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each friend needs one slice per toast, so for `n` friends, it's `n` slices per toast.\n   - **Salt**: Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so for `n` friends, it's `n * np` grams per toast.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The maximum number of toasts is constrained by whichever resource (drink, lime slices, or salt) allows the fewest toasts. We calculate the maximum possible toasts from each resource separately and then take the minimum of these values.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Total drink available is `k * l`. The maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices Calculation**: Total lime slices are `c * d`. The maximum toasts from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Total salt available is `p`. The maximum toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values, as each must be sufficient for all friends to make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    max_toasts_limes = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_limes, max_toasts_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Calculating Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`).\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`).\n3. **Determining Maximum Toasts**:\n   - **From Drink**: Divide the total drink by the drink required per toast (`n * nl`).\n   - **From Lime Slices**: Divide the total lime slices by the slices needed per toast (`n`).\n   - **From Salt**: Divide the total salt by the salt required per toast (`n * np`).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the smallest value among the three calculated maxima, ensuring no resource is depleted before others. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures that each friend can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.",
