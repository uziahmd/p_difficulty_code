After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines of m characters each (without spaces)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and form a list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 3. We need to determine for each subject (column) what is the best (highest) mark. Then, for each student, we check if there is at least one subject in which they are the best.\n\n However, note: multiple students can have the same highest mark? In that case, they are all considered best in that subject.\n\n But the problem says: \"Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\n So for a subject j, let best[j] = maximum mark in that column. Then, for student i, if for any subject j, the mark of student i in subject j equals best[j], then student i is successful.\n\n But wait: what if two or more students have the same highest mark in a subject? Then all of them are considered best in that subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   Subjects (columns):\n     Subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> best is '2'\n     Subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> best is '3'\n     Subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> best is '3'\n\n   Now, for student0 (first row): marks are '2','2','3'\n        In subject0: 2 == best[0] -> yes\n        In subject1: 2 != 3 -> no\n        In subject2: 3 == best[2] -> yes -> so student0 is successful.\n\n   Student1: marks are '2','3','2'\n        Subject0: 2 == best[0] -> yes -> successful.\n\n   Student2: marks are '1','1','2'\n        Subject0: 1 != 2 -> no\n        Subject1: 1 != 3 -> no\n        Subject2: 2 != 3 -> no -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n Approach:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and m.\n  Step 2: Read the grid (list of strings)\n\n  Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value in that column. Since the marks are characters from '1' to '9', we can compare as characters (because '9' > '1').\n\n  Step 4: For each student i (row), check for at least one column j such that grid[i][j] == max_mark[j]. If found, mark the student as successful.\n\n  Step 5: Count the number of successful students.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that might be split by newline. The sample input format:\n\n   Example input: \n      \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n  But in the problem statement, the example input is provided as a list of two strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n      The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n  And the example input is given as:\n\n      ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n  But actually, when reading from stdin, we don't get a list. We get one string (if we use input() once) or multiple lines.\n\n  Let me clarify: the input is provided via standard input.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n  Then the first line is data[0], and the next n lines are data[1:1+n].\n\n  Alternatively, we can read the first line, then read the next n lines.\n\n  Since the constraints are small (n, m <= 100), we can proceed.\n\n  Example code:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n      if not data: \n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n\n      n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(1, 1+n):\n          grid.append(data[i].strip())   # but the input is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input Data**: The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines each contain `m` characters representing the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Best Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark. This involves iterating through each column and keeping track of the maximum value encountered.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student (row), check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: After evaluating all students, count how many were marked successful and output this count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = [str(i) for i in range(9, 0, -1)]\n    best_in_subject = ['0'] * m\n    \n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        best_char = max(col_vals)\n        best_in_subject[j] = best_char\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == best_in_subject[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. The first line provides the dimensions `n` and `m`, while the following lines form the grid of marks.\n2. **Finding Best Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by comparing all entries in that column. The highest mark is stored in an array `best_in_subject`.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: Each student's marks are compared against the highest marks in each subject. If a student has the highest mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful, ensuring correctness across various scenarios.",
