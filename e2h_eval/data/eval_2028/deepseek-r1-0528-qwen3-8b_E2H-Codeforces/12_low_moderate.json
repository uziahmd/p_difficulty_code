The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise from 1 to n and then back to 1), we can think of the movement as a circular array.\n\n Important: Xenia starts at house 1. She must complete tasks in the given order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i, and note that all previous tasks must be completed.\n\n The key observation:\n Because the ringroad is circular, moving from a house x to house y can be done in two ways? Actually, the problem states that the ringroad is one-way (clockwise). So from house x, the next house is x+1 (if x < n) or 1 (if x == n). But note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", so the entire circle has n houses and the distance from any house to another is the clockwise distance.\n\n However, note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Steps for example 1:\n   Start at 1.\n   First task at 3: \n        From 1 to 3: clockwise: 1->2->3 -> 2 steps.\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since the ring is clockwise, to go from 3 to 2, we have to go 3->4->1->2 -> 3 steps.\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        2->3 -> 1 step.\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the movement as:\n\n   Let current position be `cur`. Initially, cur = 1.\n\n   For each task a_i:\n        If a_i >= cur, then the distance is (a_i - cur).\n        If a_i < cur, then the distance is (n - cur + 1 + a_i - 1) ??? \n\n   Actually, wait: from cur to a_i in clockwise direction (which is only one way) when a_i < cur:\n        We can break the journey into:\n            From cur to n: (n - cur) steps\n            Then wrap around from n to 1: 0? Actually, from n to 1 is one step if we consider the ring: but note the ring is defined as 1..n and then 1 again.\n            Then from 1 to a_i: (a_i - 1) steps.\n\n        So total = (n - cur) + (a_i - 1) + 1? Actually, wait: the step from n to 1 is the same as going from n to the next which is 1. So the entire path is (n - cur) + (a_i) because we count from cur to n (n-cur) and then from n to 1 is 1 step and then from 1 to a_i is a_i-1? But wait, the movement from n to 1 is 1 step, so:\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the clockwise distance from cur to a_i as:\n            If a_i >= cur: dist = a_i - cur\n            Else: dist = n - cur + a_i\n\n        Example: cur=3, a_i=2, then dist = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n   However, note the example: \n        cur=2, a_i=3: 3>=2 -> dist=1 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what about going from 4 to 1? \n        Using the formula: if a_i=1 and cur=4: 1<4 -> dist = 4-4+1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n   And from 4 to 2: 2<4 -> dist=4-4+2=2 -> but actually, from 4 to 2: 4->1->2 -> 2 steps, correct.\n\n   So the formula for the clockwise distance from cur to a_i (when moving only clockwise) is:\n        d = (a_i - cur) % n   [but that doesn't work for negative?] \n\n   Actually, we can use:\n        d = (a_i - cur) if a_i >= cur else (a_i + n - cur)\n\n   But wait, in modulo arithmetic: the clockwise distance from cur to a_i in a circle of size n is:\n        d = (a_i - cur) % n   -> this gives a negative if a_i < cur, so we do:\n        d = (a_i - cur) % n\n        But if (a_i - cur) is negative, then mod n would give a positive number. However, we want the actual clockwise distance.\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad consists of `n` houses arranged in a clockwise manner, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. The movement between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Xenia can only move clockwise. Therefore, the distance from her current position `cur` to the next task location `a_i` can be calculated as follows:\n   - If `a_i` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the distance is simply `a_i - cur`.\n   - If `a_i` is less than `cur`, the distance is `(n - cur) + a_i` because she has to go all the way around the ring from `cur` to `n` and then from `1` to `a_i`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in sequence, updating Xenia's current position after each task. For each task, we compute the distance from the current position to the task's location using the above logic and accumulate the total time.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `m` tasks exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), which is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + a\n        current = a\n\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of houses), `m` (number of tasks), and the list of tasks.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, it checks if the task's house number is ahead of or behind the current position in the clockwise direction. It calculates the distance accordingly and updates the total time and current position.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total accumulated time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and straightforward arithmetic to determine movement distances.",
