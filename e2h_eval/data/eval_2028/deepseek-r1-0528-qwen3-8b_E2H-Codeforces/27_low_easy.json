On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence is non-decreasing if it is all 1's or all 2's or a mix that starts with 1's and then 2's.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. Therefore, we have three cases:\n\n Case 1: Without reversing, the original sequence might already have a long non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval arbitrarily. So we can break the sequence into three parts:\n   [0:l-1], [l:r] (which is reversed), [r+1:]\n\n In the reversed part, the original order is flipped. However, since the array only has 1 and 2, reversing doesn't change the fact that if the original segment was [x1, x2, ..., xk] then after reversal it becomes [xk, ..., x1].\n\n What is the goal? We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let's think about what the entire sequence will look like:\n\n The entire sequence is composed of three parts: left, reversed middle, right.\n\n We can also consider that we might not reverse anything (i.e., reverse an empty interval) but the problem says we choose an interval [l, r] (with 1<=l<=r<=n). However, note that reversing a single element is allowed (then the middle part is just that element).\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the sequence is very small (n up to 2000), we can try to consider all possible intervals for reversal and compute the resulting sequence's LNDS. However, computing the LNDS for a sequence of length 2000 using standard O(n^2) method would be too slow if we do it for each interval (O(n^2) intervals, so O(n^4)).\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Another idea: note that the entire sequence after reversal is still going to consist of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such an array is simply the total number of 1's plus the total number of 2's that appear at least as many times as the last 1 (but note: we can interleave them arbitrarily? Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we can arrange the 1's and 2's in order. However, wait: the subsequence doesn't have to be contiguous, but the indices must be increasing.\n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1's and 2's is simply the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (all 1's then all 2's). Otherwise, we might break it.\n\n But note: even if the sequence isn't entirely non-decreasing, we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's. However, that is only valid if we can pick the 1's from the left part and the 2's from the right part without violating the index order. Actually, no: because the subsequence must follow the original order of indices. \n\n However, note: the reversal operation only reverses a contiguous interval. The rest of the sequence remains unchanged. So the entire sequence is split into three parts: left, reversed middle, right.\n\n How can we compute the LNDS for the entire sequence?\n\n We can consider that the entire sequence must be traversed. The non-decreasing subsequence can use:\n   - Some elements from the left part (in increasing index order)\n   - Then some elements from the reversed middle part (in increasing index order, but the reversed middle part is stored in decreasing order of the original indices? Actually, when we reverse, the positions of the elements in the reversed part are fixed (the indices of the reversed part become contiguous again, but the values are reversed).\n\n But note: the indices of the reversed part are fixed: the first element of the reversed part is at position l, the next at l+1, etc. However, the reversal changes the order of the values.\n\n Actually, the reversal operation does not change the relative order of the elements outside the reversed interval, and within the reversed interval the order is reversed.\n\n So the entire sequence is:\n\n   [a0, a1, ..., a_{l-2}, a_{l-1}, a_l, a_{l+1}, ... , a_{r-1}, a_r, ... a_{n-1}]\n\n After reversing [l, r]:\n\n   [a0, a1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence can only be the entire sequence if it is already non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by reversing a part. Otherwise, the LNDS will be the count of all 1s followed by all 2s in the modified sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such a sequence is simply the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s). Otherwise, the LNDS would be the sum of all 1s and 2s, but only if the 1s appear before the 2s in the sequence. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: By reversing any contiguous interval, we might be able to adjust the positions of 1s and 2s to form a longer non-decreasing subsequence. The optimal reversal will either:\n   - Make the entire sequence non-decreasing.\n   - Maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s in the sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Case 1 (No Reversal Needed)**: If the original sequence is already non-decreasing, the LNDS is the length of the entire sequence.\n   - **Case 2 (Reversal Affects the Entire Sequence)**: If reversing the entire sequence makes it non-decreasing, then the LNDS is the length of the entire sequence.\n   - **Case 3 (Partial Reversal)**: For sequences that cannot be made entirely non-decreasing by reversing any single interval, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of \"dips\" (instances where a 2 follows a 1 outside the reversed interval).\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks all possible intervals for reversal by leveraging the fact that the sequence is binary. The algorithm processes the sequence in O(n^2) time, which is feasible given the constraint n ≤ 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    # Check if the array is already non-decreasing\n    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(n-1)):\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    # Check if reversing the entire array makes it non-decreasing\n    reversed_arr = list(reversed(arr))\n    if all(reversed_arr[i] <= reversed_arr[i+1] for i in range(n-1)):\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    # Calculate the total number of 1s and 2s\n    total_ones = arr.count(1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    # Find the minimum number of dips (places where 2 comes before 1) in the entire array\n    min_dips = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[i] == 2 and arr[j] == 1:\n                dips_here = 1\n                k = 1\n                while i - k >= 0 and j + k < n and arr[i-k] == 2 and arr[j+k] == 1:\n                    k += 1\n                actual_dips = k - 1\n                if actual_dips < min_dips:\n                    min_dips = actual_dips\n                    \n    if min_dips == float('inf'):\n        min_dips = 0\n        \n    result = n - min_dips * 2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the original sequence is already non-decreasing. If so, it prints the length of the sequence as the result.\n2. **Full Reversal Check**: It then checks if reversing the entire sequence results in a non-decreasing sequence. If yes, the result is the length of the sequence.\n3. **Dip Calculation**: For sequences that don't meet the above conditions, the code calculates the number of \"dips\" (instances where a 2 precedes a 1). Each dip indicates a point where the sequence order is incorrect.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by subtracting twice the number of dips from the total length of the sequence. This adjustment accounts for correcting the order of 1s and 2s by reversing appropriate intervals.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and leverages the binary nature of the input sequence to provide an optimal solution.",
