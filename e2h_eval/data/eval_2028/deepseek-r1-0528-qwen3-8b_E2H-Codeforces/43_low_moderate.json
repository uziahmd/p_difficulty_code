He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S containing only 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. (But note: after appending c's, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' because A provided some 'a' and B appended some 'b'.)\n 2. The string must be split into three parts:\n    - Part1: Some number of 'a's (from A)\n    - Part2: Some number of 'b's (from B, appended to the end of part1)\n    - Part3: Some number of 'c's (from C, appended to the end of part1+part2)\n\n However, note that the condition for the number of 'c's is that it must be equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string.\n\n But there is an important constraint on the order: \n   - The original string from A has only 'a's.\n   - Then B appends 'b's -> so all the 'b's must come consecutively and after the 'a's.\n   - Then C appends 'c's -> so the 'c's must be at the end.\n\n Therefore, the string must have three contiguous segments: [a's] [b's] [c's]. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the string has any invalid segment: meaning if we see a 'b' then an 'a', or a 'c' then an 'a' or 'b', then it's invalid.\n\n 2. So, we can traverse and check that the characters are non-decreasing in the sense of the allowed transitions:\n    - After an 'a', we can have more 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, but no going back.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can try to split the string into three parts by finding the last 'a' (which should be the end of the first segment), then the last 'b' (if any) would be the end of the second segment? Actually, we don't require every letter to appear, but note the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b' originally, and then C appends 'c's. However, note that C appends either the same number as 'a' or 'b' (so the total string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n 4. However, note: the problem states that the string is constructed as:\n    - First, A gives a string of 'a's (at least one).\n    - Then B appends some 'b's (at least one).\n    - Then C appends some 'c's (equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the entire string at the time of appending, i.e., the entire string before appending 'c's is the original string from A and B).\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\" â€” wait, the string at the time of C's action is the string from A and B. So the number of 'a' and 'b' in the string before C appends is fixed.\n\n However, the entire string after C appends will have:\n   count_a = original count of 'a' (from A)\n   count_b = original count of 'b' (from B)\n   count_c = the number C appended\n\n And the condition is: count_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\n But note: the entire string might have more than these? Actually, the problem says the string is built from these steps.\n\n Important: The problem does not require that the entire string has only these three letters? Actually, the input is guaranteed to consist of 'a','b','c'. And the construction is only with these.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Check that the string is divided into three contiguous blocks: [a...a][b...b][c...c] (each block might be empty? but note: at least one 'a' and one 'b' originally, so the first two blocks cannot be empty. However, note: the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', but what about the 'c'? The problem says C appends some number (could be zero? but note: the condition says \"some number\", but also the condition for the count of c is set by the number of a or b. However, the problem states: \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", so if the number of a or b is zero then that condition wouldn't hold. But we know from the beginning that there is at least one 'a' and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific sequence of operations described. The operations involve appending 'b's and then 'c's to a string of 'a's, with certain constraints on the counts of these characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Valid Character Order**: The string must consist of three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then zero or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate 'c' Count**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both). If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string has only three segments: a's, then b's, then c's.\n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    # Traverse to find the end of 'a' segment\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Then traverse to find the end of 'b' segment\n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    # Then the rest should be 'c's\n    k = j\n    while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    # Now, check if we have covered the entire string and the segments are in order.\n    if k != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Now, check that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    count_a = i\n    count_b = j - i\n    count_c = n - j\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Validation**: The code first checks if the string can be divided into three contiguous segments: 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. If any character appears out of this order, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: The code counts the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in their respective segments.\n3. **Condition Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is satisfied and there is at least one 'a' and one 'b', the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the structural and numerical constraints required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
