There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there will be exactly n-1 games in total (each game eliminates one player). However, the winner is the one who wins all his/her games. The question is: what is the maximum number of games the winner can take part in?\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players needed for a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n How can we structure the tournament? The rule says that two players can play only if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We can think of building the tournament as a complete binary tree? But note: the example for n=4: \n   Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n\n Explanation: \n   One way: \n      Round 1: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4)\n      Round 2: (1 vs 3) or (1 vs 4) doesn't matter. So the winner plays 2 games.\n\n But why can't the winner play more? For example, if we try to make the winner play 3 games, then the winner must beat three opponents. However, in a single-elimination tournament, the winner must come from one side. \n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n Let the winner play k games. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k - 1 players? Not exactly, because the rule allows for a more flexible bracket.\n\n Actually, let's try to model the tournament:\n\n We can think of the tournament as having rounds. In each round, the players are divided into groups such that the number of games played so far for the players in the same group is the same or differs by one.\n\n Another idea: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the total number of players required to have a winner play k games is <= n.\n\n How many players are required for the winner to play k games?\n\n Consider the tournament as a graph of wins. The winner must win k consecutive games. Additionally, to set up the matches, we need to have other players to be eliminated.\n\n We can use the following recurrence:\n\n Let a0 = 1 (the winner) and then for each subsequent game, the requirement for the next opponent is built on two types of subtrees: one that requires the same number of games and one that requires one more game.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n   Let f(0) = 1   (no games, just the winner)\n   Then, to have a tournament where the winner plays 1 game, we need at least 2 players: the winner and one opponent. But note: the winner must have 0 games and the opponent 0 or 1? Actually, the first game: both have 0 games, so they can play. Then the winner has 1 game.\n\n   For k games, the winner must have won k games. The k-th game is against a player who has played k-1 games (because the rule: the difference must be at most one). But wait, actually the rule says that when two players are going to play, their existing games must differ by at most one. \n\n   However, note: the winner's record after k-1 wins is k-1, and the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games? Actually, the opponent must have played k-1 games (if we want to continue the chain) or k-2? \n\n   Actually, the rule does not specify which one must have how many, but the condition is that the difference is at most one. So the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n   Now, to maximize the number of games the winner plays, we want to build a tree where the winner's path requires as many games as possible.\n\n   We can define two sequences:\n     A_k = minimum number of players needed so that the winner can have k games (and then proceed to k+1)\n     B_k = minimum number of players needed so that the winner can have k games and the entire tournament is set up so that the next game (if any) would require the opponent to have k games (so that the winner can have k+1 games)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a recursive structure:\n\n   To have a tournament where the winner plays k games, we must have:\n\n   In the last game (the k-th game), the winner plays against a player who has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must be structured so that the winner can accumulate k wins. The minimal tournament that gives the winner k wins must have:\n\n   - One subtree that provides the k-1 wins for the winner (which is a tournament of size A_{k-1})\n   - And one subtree that provides the k-th opponent, which must have a structure that leads to a player with k-1 or k-2 wins (but note: the opponent must have exactly k-1 wins if the winner is to have k wins and the opponent just lost? Actually, no: the opponent must have a certain number of wins to face the winner. However, the rule only constrains the match: the winner has k-1 wins and the opponent must have either k-2 or k-0? Actually, the rule says: \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\". So when the winner has k-1 wins, the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k? \n\n   But wait, the opponent must have just finished a set of games and then this is the k-th game for the winner. However, the opponent must have played some games and then lost to the winner. The rule for the match is only about the state before the match. So the opponent must have a record of either k-2, k-1, or k? \n\n   However, if the opponent has k games, then the winner has k-1, so the difference is 1 -> allowed. But can the opponent have k games? Then the opponent must have beaten k players. But then the opponent must have been present in a tournament that had at least 2^k - 1 players (if it were a perfect binary tree) but note: our tournament is not necessarily perfect.\n\n   Actually, the problem is symmetric: we are arranging the entire grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds). The goal is to maximize the winner's games.\n\n   Let F(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that the winner can have k games.\n\n   Then, the last game (the k-th) is between the winner (with k-1 wins) and an opponent. The opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins (because the difference must be at most one). \n\n   Now, if the opponent has k-1 wins, then the entire subtree for that opponent must have provided k-1 wins. Similarly, if the opponent has k-2 wins, then the subtree must have provided k-2 wins.\n\n   However, to get the minimal total players, we can choose the option that minimizes the total players. But note: the entire tournament has two parts: the winner's path and the opponent's path.\n\n   But wait, the entire tournament must eliminate all other players. The winner's path is fixed: k wins. The opponent's path must be one of two possibilities.\n\n   Actually, the entire tournament can be broken down as:\n\n   - The winner beats k opponents. Each opponent comes from a separate branch (or maybe not, but note: the opponent for the k-th game must be a player that has survived until then).\n\n   However, we can also consider that the tournament is built by having two subtrees: one that leads to the winner and one that leads to the opponent.\n\n   We can define:\n\n   Let A(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner plays k games.\n\n   Then, to get the k-th win for the winner, we must have:\n\n   The winner must have already played k-1 games, and the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games.\n\n   Now, the entire set of players is:\n\n   - The winner: 1\n   - The k opponents (each from a different branch, but note: the entire tournament must have the structure that the opponent for the k-th game is the winner of a subtree that has been built independently)\n\n   However, we can also use the same structure for multiple opponents. Actually, the tournament is a knockout, so we can imagine a bracket.\n\n   There is a known structure for such tournaments: the minimal number of players for a winner to have k games is given by a recurrence:\n\n   We can define two functions:\n\n     Let a_k = minimal number of players to have a winner with k wins and the entire tournament is set up so that the next game (if the winner continues) requires the opponent to have k-1 wins (i.e., the opponent comes from a subtree that is designed for k-1 wins, but then the winner will face an opponent with k-1 wins, so the next game would be the k+1-th? Actually, we are defining the minimal tournament for k wins.)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n     Let x_k = minimal number of players for the winner to have k wins (without any further constraint on the opponent's record for the next match)\n\n   But note: the rule must hold for every match. \n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   Consider the tournament as a full binary tree? Not necessarily, because the rule allows for a non-perfect structure.\n\n   Another approach: \n\n   We can model the tournament as having two sets of players: those who have played i games and those who have played i-1 games (for the current round). \n\n   However, note that the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can play, given n players.\n\n   We can use a greedy construction:\n\n   Let the winner play k games. Then, the minimal number of players required is at least:\n\n     T(0) = 1   (the winner)\n     Then, for each game, the winner must defeat an opponent. The first opponent must come from a set of players that can be arranged in a minimal tournament.\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must have the winner and the other n-1 players. We are to arrange the grid arbitrarily (subject to the rule) to maximize the winner's games.\n\n   We can think of the tournament as being built in rounds. In the first round, we can have at most floor(n/2) games, but the winner's path is fixed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n   Let f(k) = minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\n   Then, the winner must have k wins. The k-th win is against an opponent who must have either k-1 or k-2 wins (before the match). \n\n   However, to minimize the total number of players, we would choose the opponent with the minimal required subtree. \n\n   But note: we are trying to compute the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n   We can define:\n\n     Let a_k = minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins, and the entire tournament is built so that the opponent in the k-th game has k-1 wins (the maximal allowed).\n\n     Then, the minimal tournament for k wins is:\n\n        a_0 = 1\n        a_1 = 2\n\n        For k>=2, the k-th win requires the winner to have k-1 wins and the opponent to have k-1 wins (so the opponent comes from a subtree that requires a_{k-1} players). However, note: the entire tournament must account for the players in the opponent's subtree and the winner's previous subtree.\n\n        But wait: the winner's previous k-1 wins require a_{k-1} players (excluding the winner). And the opponent's k-1 wins require a_{k-1} players. However, the winner and the opponent's subtree are disjoint. So total players = 1 (the winner) + (a_{k-1} - 1) [the rest of the winner's subtree] + (a_{k-1}) [the opponent's subtree] ?\n\n        Actually, the winner's entire path (including the previous k-1 wins) is built from a_{k-1} players (which includes the winner and the opponents in the previous rounds). But wait, the a_{k-1} already includes the winner? \n\n        Let me redefine: \n\n        Let g(k) be the minimal number of players that can be eliminated (i.e., total players excluding the winner) such that the winner can have k wins.\n\n        Then, for the k-th win, the winner must defeat an opponent. The opponent must come from a subtree that has been built with a minimal number of players. \n\n        The opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n\n        If we choose the opponent to have k-1 wins, then the entire subtree for the opponent (which is a minimal tournament for k-1 wins) requires g(k-1) players (eliminated players) plus the opponent (so total g(k-1)+1). But wait, the entire tournament (for the opponent's side) must have at least g(k-1) players (which are the ones that were eliminated in the opponent's path) and the opponent (who is one of the players). However, the winner's side also has the winner and the opponents in the previous rounds (which are g(k-1) as well). \n\n        Actually, the entire tournament has two independent subtrees (for the winner and the opponent) and then the final match. But note: the winner must have come from a subtree that has k-1 wins (so that's g(k-1) eliminated players). The opponent must have come from a subtree that has either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of eliminated players (excluding the winner) is:\n\n          If the opponent has k-1 wins: then the opponent's subtree has g(k-1) eliminated players (so total eliminated players = g(k-1) [from the winner's side] + g(k-1) [from the opponent's side])? \n\n        But wait, the winner's side: the winner's path has k-1 wins, which means the winner defeated k-1 opponents. Each of these opponents must have been the winners of their own subtrees. The entire winner's subtree (including the winner) has 1 + g(k-1) players? \n\n        Actually, let me define:\n\n          Let h(k) = minimal total number of players (including the winner) needed for the winner to have k wins.\n\n        Then, the winner must have k wins, so he must have played k games. The k-th game is against an opponent who has either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n        The minimal way is to have the opponent's subtree as small as possible.\n\n        Case 1: Opponent has k-1 wins.\n          Then, the opponent's entire subtree (which is a minimal tournament for k-1 wins) requires h(k-1) players (including the opponent). But note: the winner's entire subtree (to get to k-1 wins) requires h(k-1) players (including the winner). However, the two subtrees are disjoint, and then we have the final match. So the total players is h(k-1) [winner's side] + h(k-1) [opponent's side] - 1? Because the winner is counted in the winner's side and the opponent is counted in the opponent's side, but they are distinct. Actually, no: the two sides are separate. So total players = h(k-1) + h(k-1) - 1? \n\n        But wait, the winner is the root of the winner's side, and the opponent is the root of the opponent's side. They are two different players. So the total number of players is h(k-1) + h(k-1) - 1? No, because the winner's side has h(k-1) players and the opponent's side has h(k-1) players, and the two sides are disjoint. So total is h(k-1) + h(k-1) = 2 * h(k-1). But then the winner is included in the first h(k-1) and the opponent is included in the second h(k-1). So no overlap. Then the total is 2 * h(k-1).\n\n        However, we also have the possibility of the opponent having k-2 wins.\n\n        Case 2: Opponent has k-2 wins.\n          Then, the opponent's entire subtree requires h(k-2) players (including the opponent). Then total players = h(k-1) [for the winner's side] + h(k-2) [for the opponent's side].\n\n        Then, we choose the minimal total players for k wins to be the minimum of the two cases? \n\n        But wait, we are trying to minimize the total players for a fixed k. However, the structure for the winner's side is fixed: we need h(k-1) for the winner's side. Then the opponent's side can be either h(k-1) (if the opponent has k-1 wins) or h(k-2) (if the opponent has k-2 wins). To minimize the total, we choose the smaller one: so h(k) = h(k-1) + min(h(k-1), h(k-2))\n\n        However, note: the rule does not force us to use the minimal structure for the opponent's side. We are free to arrange the entire grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds). Therefore, to have the winner play k games, we must have at least one way to set up the tournament. The minimal requirement is the minimal total players over the two possibilities.\n\n        But wait, is that correct? Actually, the two possibilities are:\n\n          Option 1: Opponent has k-1 wins -> then total players = h(k-1) + h(k-1) = 2 * h(k-1)\n          Option 2: Opponent has k-2 wins -> then total players = h(k-1) + h(k-2)\n\n        And we want the minimal total players for k wins to be the minimum of these two? \n\n        However, note: the entire tournament must be structured so that the winner can have k wins. We can choose the opponent's record arbitrarily (either k-1 or k-2) as long as the rule holds. Therefore, we can choose the option that minimizes the total number of players.\n\n        Then, we can define:\n\n          h(0) = 1   [the winner alone]\n          h(1) = 2   [the winner and one opponent]\n\n          For k>=2:\n            h(k) = h(k-1) + min(h(k-1), h(k-2))\n\n        But wait, let's check:\n\n          k=0: 1\n          k=1: 2\n          k=2: 2 + min(2, 1) = 2+1 = 3\n          k=3: 3 + min(3,2) = 3+2 = 5\n          k=4: 5 + min(5,3) = 5+3 = 8\n\n        Now, what does h(k) represent? It is the minimal total number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n        Then, the answer for a given n (number of players) is the maximum k such that h(k) <= n.\n\n        Let's validate with the examples:\n\n        Example n=2: \n          k=0: 1<=2 -> yes\n          k=1: 2<=2 -> yes\n          k=2: 3<=2 -> no -> so maximum k=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n        Example n=3:\n          k=0: 1<=3 -> yes\n          k=1: 2<=3 -> yes\n          k=2: 3<=3 -> yes\n          k=3: 5<=3 -> no -> so maximum k=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n        Example n=4:\n          k=0: 1<=4 -> yes\n          k=1: 2<=4 -> yes\n          k=2: 3<=4 -> yes\n          k=3: 5<=4 -> no -> so maximum k=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n        Example n=10:\n          k=0: 1<=10 -> yes\n          k=1: 2<=10 -> yes\n          k=2: 3<=10 -> yes\n          k=3: 5<=10 -> yes\n          k=4: 8<=10 -> yes\n          k=5: 13<=10 -> no -> so maximum k=4 -> output 4. Correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input for 10 gives output 4.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the tournament hasn't started and the grid is being arranged. The above recurrence gives the minimal total players needed for the winner to have k wins. Then we find the maximum k such that h(k) <= n.\n\n        But is the recurrence correct? \n\n        Let me explain h(2)=3: \n          Winner plays 2 games. The minimal tournament: \n            First game: winner (0 games) vs opponent1 (0 games) -> winner wins.\n            Second game: winner (1 game) vs opponent2 (0 or 1 game). \n          To minimize the total players, we choose opponent2 to have 0 games? But wait, the rule: the difference must be at most one. The winner has 1 game, so opponent2 must have either 0 or 1. \n\n          However, if we choose opponent2 to have 0 games, then the total players is: \n            The winner's first opponent: must be a separate player (so we have 2 players so far). Then the second opponent must be another separate player (so total 3). \n\n          Alternatively, if we use the same opponent twice? No, because the opponent leaves after the first loss.\n\n          So the minimal tournament for 2 wins is 3 players.\n\n        For h(3)=5:\n          The winner must have 3 wins. The third game: the opponent must have either 2 or 1 wins.\n\n          Option 1: Opponent has 2 wins -> then the opponent's subtree requires h(2)=3 players (including the opponent). The winner's subtree requires h(2)=3 players (including the winner). Total = 3+3 = 6.\n\n          Option 2: Opponent has 1 win -> then the opponent's subtree requires h(1)=2 players. The winner's subtree requires h(2)=3. Total = 3+2 = 5.\n\n          So minimal is 5.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n          h(0) = 1\n          h(1) = 2\n          for k>=2: h(k) = h(k-1) + min(h(k-1), h(k-2))\n\n        But note: the sequence h(k) grows exponentially. Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate k from 0 until we exceed n.\n\n        We need to do a binary search on k? Or we can generate the sequence until we exceed n.\n\n        However, note that k will be logarithmic in n (since the sequence is roughly doubling every step). The maximum k is about O(log n) base phi (golden ratio) or even base 2? Actually, the recurrence is similar to Fibonacci but with a min operation.\n\n        Let's write the recurrence without the min:\n\n          Without min: h(k) = h(k-1) + h(k-1) = 2*h(k-1) -> then h(k) = 2^k, so k ~ log2(n). But with the min, sometimes we add h(k-2) which is half the size? \n\n        Actually, the sequence with min is:\n\n          h(0) = 1\n          h(1) = 2\n          h(2) = 2 + min(2,1) = 3\n          h(3) = 3 + min(3,2) = 5\n          h(4) = 5 + min(5,3) = 8\n          h(5) = 8 + min(8,5) = 13\n          h(6) = 13 + min(13,8) = 21\n          h(7) = 21 + min(21,13) = 34\n\n        This sequence is similar to Fibonacci but starting at 1,2,3,5,8,13,... (like Fibonacci but shifted). \n\n        Actually, let me compare:\n\n          Fibonacci: \n            F0=0, F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, ...\n\n          Our sequence: \n            k:0 -> 1\n            k:1 -> 2\n            k:2 -> 3\n            k:3 -> 5\n            k:4 -> 8\n            k:5 -> 13\n            k:6 -> 21\n\n        It is the Fibonacci numbers starting from index 2 (if we define Fibonacci with F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, ...) but note:\n\n          h(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\n        Where Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, ...\n\n        Check:\n          k=0: h(0)=1 = Fib(2)=1 -> yes.\n          k=1: h(1)=2 = Fib(3)=2 -> yes.\n          k=2: h(2)=3 = Fib(4)=3 -> yes.\n          k=3: h(3)=5 = Fib(5)=5 -> yes.\n\n        Therefore, h(k) = Fib(k+2) (if we define Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ...)\n\n        But wait, the recurrence for Fibonacci is:\n\n          Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1\n          Fib(k) = Fib(k-1) + Fib(k-2)\n\n        Then, h(k) = Fib(k+2) = Fib(k+1) + Fib(k) = Fib(k) + Fib(k-1) + Fib(k-1) ??? \n\n        Actually, let me compute:\n\n          h(k) = h(k-1) + min(h(k-1), h(k-2))\n\n        And h(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\n        Then, Fib(k+2) = Fib(k+1) + Fib(k)   [by definition]\n\n        Also, h(k-1) = Fib(k+1)\n        h(k-2) = Fib(k)\n\n        Then, min(Fib(k+1), Fib(k)) = Fib(k)   [since Fib(k+1) >= Fib(k)]\n\n        Then, h(k) = Fib(k+1) + Fib(k) = Fib(k+2) -> matches.\n\n        But wait, the recurrence uses the minimum of h(k-1) and h(k-2). Since the Fibonacci sequence is increasing, then Fib(k+1) >= Fib(k), so the min is Fib(k). Then:\n\n          h(k) = Fib(k+1) + Fib(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\n        So the recurrence is consistent.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n          h(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\n        Then the problem reduces to: find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n        Then the answer is k.\n\n        Now, how to compute this for n up to 10^18?\n\n        We know that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially (about (golden_ratio)^k). \n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. We need to generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n        However, note: the Fibonacci numbers here start from:\n\n          Fib(0)=0\n          Fib(1)=1\n          Fib(2)=1\n          Fib(3)=2\n          Fib(4)=3\n          Fib(5)=5\n          ...\n\n        We are interested in Fib(k+2) for k>=0.\n\n        Let m = k+2, then we are looking for the maximum m such that Fib(m) <= n, then k = m-2.\n\n        But note: the minimal total players for k wins is Fib(k+2). Then we require Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n        However, note: k must be at least 0. \n\n        Example: n=2 -> Fib(0+2)=Fib(2)=1<=2 -> k=0 is valid, but then k=1: Fib(3)=2<=2 -> valid, k=2: Fib(4)=3>2 -> so maximum k=1.\n\n        So we are looking for the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n        We can generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          a, b = 0, 1\n          count = 0   (this will be m, the index in Fibonacci, starting from 0)\n\n          But note: we need to go up to index m = k+2.\n\n          Alternatively, we can generate:\n\n          Let m0 = 0: Fib(0)=0\n          m1 = 1: Fib(1)=1\n          m2 = 2: Fib(2)=1\n          m3 = 3: Fib(3)=2\n\n          We want the maximum m such that Fib(m) <= n, then k = m-2.\n\n        However, note: the minimal total players for k wins is Fib(k+2). So for k=0, we use Fib(2)=1; for k=1, Fib(3)=2; for k=2, Fib(4)=3.\n\n        We can iterate:\n\n          fib0 = 0, fib1 = 1\n          Then, for m from 2 upwards, fib2 = fib0+fib1, then update fib0, fib1.\n\n        But we don't care about the exact k until we have the Fibonacci index. \n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Let a, b = 0, 1\n          index = 0   (current Fibonacci index)\n\n          We are interested in the Fibonacci sequence for indices from 0 up to ... until we get a Fibonacci number > n.\n\n          Then, once we have the Fibonacci numbers, we know that the maximum k is the largest integer such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n          But note: Fib(k+2) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          fibs = [0,1]\n          while fibs[-1] <= n:\n            fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])\n\n          Then, the last computed Fibonacci number is greater than n. Then, we look for the last Fibonacci number <= n.\n\n          Let m = len(fibs)-1   (the index of the last computed Fibonacci number, which is too big)\n          Then, the previous Fibonacci number is fibs[-2] = Fib(m-1). But we want the largest index t such that Fib(t) <= n.\n\n          Then, we require Fib(t) <= n and Fib(t+1) > n.\n\n          Then, k_max = t - 2   (since Fib(t) = Fib(k+2) => k = t-2)\n\n          But note: t must be at least 2.\n\n        Example: n=2\n\n          fibs: [0,1,1,2,3,...]\n\n          We break when we get 3 (which is >2). Then, the last Fibonacci number <=2 is 2 (at index 3). Then t=3, then k = 3-2 = 1.\n\n        Example: n=3\n\n          fibs: [0,1,1,2,3,5,...] -> stop at 5 (which is >3). Then the last Fibonacci <=3 is 3 (index 4). Then k=4-2=2.\n\n        Example: n=10\n\n          fibs: [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13] -> stop at 13 (which is >10). Then the last <=10 is 8 (index 6). Then k=6-2=4.\n\n        But wait, the example input n=10 gives output 4, which is k=4.\n\n        However, note: the minimal total players for k=4 is Fib(6)=8, which is <=10. Then k=4 is valid. Then we can have a winner with 4 wins.\n\n        But wait, the example input n=10 gives output 4. Correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input n=4 gives output 2, which is k=2. \n\n        For n=4: \n          fibs: [0,1,1,2,3,5] -> stops at 5 (which is >4). Then the last <=4 is 3 (index 4). Then k=4-2=2.\n\n        But wait, k=2: minimal total players is Fib(4)=3, which is <=4 -> valid. Then the maximum k is 2.\n\n        However, note that the minimal total players for k=3 is Fib(5)=5, which is >4 -> so k=3 is not valid.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n.\n          Step 2: Generate the Fibonacci sequence until the next Fibonacci number exceeds n.\n          Step 3: Let t be the index (starting from 0) of the last Fibonacci number <= n. Then k = t-2.\n\n        But note: the Fibonacci sequence we generate:\n\n          index0: 0\n          index1: 1\n          index2: 1\n          index3: 2\n          index4: 3\n          index5: 5\n\n        We break when the next Fibonacci number exceeds n.\n\n        However, we must be cautious because n can be very large (up to 10^18). The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially (base ~1.618) so the number of terms is about log_base_phi(n) which is around 100 for n=10^18.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          a, b = 0, 1\n          index = 0\n          fib_list = [0,1]   # we start with the first two\n\n          Then, we want to get the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire list and just keep the last two and the index.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          a, b = 0, 1\n          count = 0   # index of the current Fibonacci number\n\n          while b <= n:\n              a, b = b, a+b\n              count += 1\n\n          Then, the last b that exceeded n was computed from a and b, and the previous one (a) was the last <=n.\n\n          But note: we want the index t such that Fib(t) <= n and Fib(t+1) > n.\n\n          In the loop:\n\n            Initially: a=0, b=1 -> count=0 (then we do the first assignment: a becomes 1, b becomes 0+1=1, then count=1 -> now we have Fib(1)=1)\n\n          Let me adjust:\n\n          We can do:\n\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            index = 1   # because we have Fib(1)=1\n\n            Then, while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                index += 1\n\n            Then, after the loop, the last Fibonacci number that is <=n is the one we just left (the old b) and the index is index-1? \n\n          Actually, let me run for n=2:\n\n            Start: a=0, b=1, index=1 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true\n            Then: a=1, b=0+1=1, index=2 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true\n            Then: a=1, b=1+1=2, index=3 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true\n            Then: a=2, b=1+2=3, index=4 -> condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n            Then, the last index for which Fib(index)<=2 is index=3, but wait: Fib(3)=2, so that's correct.\n\n            Then, k = index - 2 = 3-2 = 1.\n\n          But wait, we broke the loop when we computed b=3 (which is >2). Then the last valid index is 3 (with value 2). \n\n          However, in the loop, we update a and b and then check the new b. \n\n          We can modify the loop to remember the previous b (the one that was <=n) and its index.\n\n          Alternatively, we can break the loop and then the last valid index is index-1.\n\n          But note: the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop? Actually, we check at the beginning: if the current b (which is the next Fibonacci number) is <=n, then we update.\n\n          Actually, the code above updates and then checks the next one.\n\n          Better:\n\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            index = 0   # current index, we haven't started\n            # We'll traverse until we exceed n\n\n            # We want to find the last index t such that Fib(t) <= n.\n\n            # Let me restructure:\n\n            fib0 = 0\n            fib1 = 1\n            t = 1   # index of the current fib1 (which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games does not exceed one. The tournament starts with `n` players, and the goal is to find the largest number of games the winner can win under these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have `k` wins is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number. This insight allows us to efficiently compute the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Insight**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so for large `n` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)), we can generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed `n`. The largest `k` such that the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n` gives the answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use an iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers, checking each subsequent number against `n` until we find the first number that exceeds `n`. The index of the last valid Fibonacci number helps us determine the maximum `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    index = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        index += 1\n    k = index - 3\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 0, it prints 0 since no games can be played.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 0 and 1, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers. The loop continues generating subsequent Fibonacci numbers until `b` exceeds `n`.\n4. **Index Calculation**: The variable `index` keeps track of the current position in the Fibonacci sequence. Once the loop exits, `index` holds the position of the first Fibonacci number greater than `n`. The maximum number of games `k` is then calculated as `index - 3` because the minimal players required for `k` wins is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n5. **Output**: The result `k` is printed, which is the maximum number of games the tournament winner can participate in under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to solve the problem in logarithmic time relative to `n`, making it suitable for very large values of `n`.",
