Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given the coordinates of home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) defining the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided into blocks by these lines. We can only move from one block to another if they share a non-zero boundary (i.e., a segment of a road). This means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road (and nothing else).\n\n However, note: We start in a block and want to get to the university's block. Each step crosses one road (and moves from one block to an adjacent one). But note: it's possible that multiple roads separate two blocks, but we are allowed to cross one road at a time.\n\n But note: The problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". Since the common border is a part of a road, this means that the two blocks must be separated by exactly one road (because if they were separated by two or more roads, then they don't share a full road segment as a border? Actually, no: the borders between two adjacent blocks is exactly one road. \n\n However, consider: Two blocks that are separated by one road can be adjacent. Then the minimum number of steps would be the number of roads that separate the home block from the university block? But note: we might have to cross the same road twice? Actually, no: because once you cross a road, you are in a different side, so you don't need to cross it again.\n\n Actually, think about the following: each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and the university are located in some half-plane defined by each road. We can assign to each road a sign (or a boolean) for the home and for the university: which side of the road they are on.\n\n Now, two points (home and university) lie on the same side of a road if the sign (the value of the linear equation) has the same sign. If they lie on opposite sides, then to go from home to university we must cross that road.\n\n Therefore, the minimum number of steps is the number of roads for which home and university are on opposite sides.\n\n However, wait: the example input 1:\n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0\n\n   Let's compute for each road:\n\n   Road1 (y=0): \n        Home: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        University: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> opposite\n\n   Road2 (x=0):\n        Home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        University: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> opposite\n\n   So both roads are separating the two points. Then the answer is 2.\n\n   Example input 2:\n        '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads:\n        Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n        Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        Road3: 1*x + 1*y - 3 = 0 -> x+y=3\n\n   Check Road1: same as above -> opposite.\n   Road2: same as above -> opposite.\n   Road3: \n        Home: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n        University: -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same side.\n\n   So we have two roads that separate, so the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) for home and university are opposite.\n\n But wait: what does it mean for a point to be on a side? We are guaranteed that the point is not on the road (so the equation evaluates to non-zero). However, note: the sign of the equation (a*x+b*y+c) can be positive or negative.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1)\n   Read university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If (f1 * f2 < 0) then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Then output the count.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is defined with negative coefficients? Note that the equation a*x+b*y+c=0 defines the same line as (-a)*x + (-b)*y -c = 0. But the sign of the evaluation at a fixed point will flip. However, the product f1*f2 will still be negative if they are on opposite sides, because if one is positive and the other negative, then the product is negative regardless of the scaling factor (unless we multiply both by the same negative, but we are using the same representation for both points). \n\n But note: the equations are given as is. So we don't change the equation. The condition for being on opposite sides is that the signs of (a*x+b*y+c) for the two points are opposite.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the equation might be defined such that the normal vector (a, b) points to one side. But the product test is standard.\n\n Example: \n        Line: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0. \n        Point (0,1): 0*0 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive (above the x-axis)\n        Point (0,-1): 0*0 + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative (below the x-axis)\n\n        Now, if we use the equation 0*x -1*y + 0 = 0 (which is the same as y=0 but multiplied by -1), then:\n        Point (0,1): 0*0 -1*1 + 0 = -1 -> negative\n        Point (0,-1): 0*0 -1*(-1) + 0 = 1 -> positive\n\n        Then the product for (0,1) and (0,-1) would be (-1)*1 = -1 -> negative, so same result.\n\n So the product condition holds.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   home = (x1, y1)\n   uni = (x2, y2)\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        home=(1,1), uni=(-1,-1), n=2, roads: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]\n\n        Road1: a=0,b=1,c=0\n            f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n            f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1\n            product = 1 * (-1) = -1 -> count becomes 1\n\n        Road2: a=1,b=0,c=0\n            f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n            f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1\n            product = 1 * (-1) = -1 -> count becomes 2\n\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n Example 2:\n        home=(1,1), uni=(-1,-1), n=3, roads: [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,-3]\n\n        Road1: [1,0,0] -> same as above, count=1 (from 0)\n        Road2: [0,1,0] -> same as above, count=2 (from 0)\n        Road3: [1,1,-3]\n            f1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1\n            f2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5\n            product = (-1)*(-5) = 5 > 0 -> not opposite.\n\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n But wait, the example input 2 was given as:\n\n        '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n        And the expected output is 2.\n\n However, note: the example input 2 in the problem statement is provided as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        But wait, the third road is defined as \"1 1 -3\", meaning the equation is 1*x + 1*y -3 = 0, which is the same as x+y=3.\n\n        We did the calculation correctly.\n\n However, let me check with the example input provided in the problem:\n\n        The first example input is given as:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        And the second example input is:\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        And the outputs are 2 and 2.\n\n But wait, the problem example output is shown as:\n\n        Output: ['2', '2']\n\n        However, note that the problem statement says:\n\n        Example Input:\n          ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        And the Output: ['2', '2']\n\n        So our solution produces the correct outputs.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the roads divide the plane and we are to find the minimum number of steps. Why is the minimum number of steps equal to the number of roads separating the two points?\n\n Explanation: Each time we cross a road, we move from one block to an adjacent one. To get from the home block to the university block, we must cross every road that separates the two. Moreover, we cannot avoid crossing a separating road (because the two points are in opposite sides). Therefore, the minimal path must cross each separating road exactly once (if we cross a road twice, we can remove those two crossings and get a shorter path). Thus, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But wait: the movement is defined as moving from one block to another if they share a non-zero border. This corresponds to crossing one road. Then, the entire journey is a sequence of crossings of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to take a direct route. But the minimal steps must be the number of separating roads because:\n\n   - We start in the home block and end in the university block.\n   - Each step crosses one road and changes the side for one road.\n   - We must change the side for every road that separates the two (i.e., every road that has opposite signs for the two points).\n\n   Therefore, we must cross at least that many roads.\n\n   And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, let me consider an edge case: when there are no roads separating the two points? Then we don't need to cross any, so steps=0.\n\n Example: \n        Home: (0,0), University: (1,1)\n        Roads: none (n=0) -> then output 0.\n\n But wait, the input says n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0? Actually, the problem says n>=1.\n\n But wait, the problem states: \"The following n lines\" and n is at least 1.\n\n However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\"\n\n So we are safe.\n\n Another edge case: multiple roads, but the two points are separated by the same road? Actually, we count each road independently.\n\n But note: two different roads might separate the two points, and we must cross each one.\n\n Example: three roads, two of which separate the points, then we must cross two roads.\n\n One more thing: what if the two points are separated by a road but the road equation is given with negative coefficients? Our product condition still holds.\n\n Let me test with a flipped equation for one of the roads in example 1.\n\n        Instead of [0,1,0] and [1,0,0], let's use [0,-1,0] and [1,0,0].\n\n        Road1: [0,-1,0] -> equation: 0*x -1*y +0 = 0 -> y=0 (same line as before, but equation is negative)\n\n        For home (1,1): 0*1 + (-1)*1 + 0 = -1\n        For uni (-1,-1): 0*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) +0 = 1\n        Product: (-1)*1 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n        So same result.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Evaluate the linear expression for home and university\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: there is a potential issue with integer overflow? The values can be up to 10^6, and the coefficients too, and the points too. The product of two numbers: each can be as large as 10^6 * 10^6 * (coefficient up to 10^6) -> worst-case absolute value: 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e18, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow in terms of value, but the multiplication of two large numbers might be slow? But n is at most 300, so we do 300 multiplications, and each multiplication is of numbers up to 10^18? Actually, the maximum absolute value of the expression is |a*x1+b*y1+c|, and the worst-case for a term is |a*x1|: a and x1 up to 10^6, so |a*x1| up to 10^12. Then adding the other terms (b*y1 and c) which are also up to 10^12, so the absolute value of the expression can be up to about 3e12? Then the product of two such expressions can be (3e12)^2 = 9e24, which is a big integer but Python can handle it. However, we are only doing 300 of these, so it's acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates are in the range [-10^6, 10^6]. The worst-case absolute value of the expression is |a*x1 + b*y1 + c|, and the maximum absolute value for a*x1 is 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, similarly for b*y1 and c. So the absolute value of the expression could be as large as 3*10^12, and the product of two such expressions could be (3*10^12)^2 = 9e24, which is acceptable in Python (since we are not storing all of them, just the product for the condition).\n\n However, note: we don't actually need the product if the signs are opposite. We can check the signs without multiplying the entire numbers.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n\n   But that's the same as val1 * val2 < 0, unless one of them is zero, but the problem guarantees that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are non-zero.\n\n So either way is fine.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem input format: the first two lines are the home and university coordinates, then the integer n, then n lines of three integers.\n\n We read from stdin.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        a = int(data[0]); b = int(data[1]); c = int(data[2])\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, note: the input might have negative numbers and the arithmetic is straightforward.\n\n Let me run the provided examples with this code.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n But wait, the problem example input 2 is provided as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        However, the example output is 2, and our code returns 2.\n\n However, the problem statement also says:\n\n        \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\"\n\n        So we don't have to worry about division by zero or zeros in the expression.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n But wait, is there any other interpretation? \n\n Consider: what if two roads are the same? The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" So we don't have duplicate lines.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, and ai and bi are not both zero. So we are safe.\n\n Let me submit the code as below.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the home and university blocks are separated by certain roads. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate these two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads lie between two points (home and university) in a plane divided by multiple infinite lines. Each line (road) splits the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in specific half-planes relative to each road.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, crossing that road is necessary to move from one block to the other. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required, as each step involves crossing one such road.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, evaluate the sign of the linear equation (ax + by + c) at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and it must be crossed once.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With `n` up to 300, this approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home (`x1, y1`) and university (`x2, y2`), followed by the number of roads `n`.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road defined by coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`, the code evaluates the linear equation `ax + by + c` at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: If the product of the evaluations at the two points is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road, meaning the road separates them. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of separating roads is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, as each step involves crossing one such road.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with a linear pass through the list of roads.",
