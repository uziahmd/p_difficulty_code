Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of cards (from the infinite set) that have integers between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n We need to find the minimum number of additional cards (each with an integer in [-x, x]) such that the overall sum is 0.\n\n Note: We can choose any card from the set of integers from -x to x arbitrarily many times.\n\n Let k be the number of additional cards. Then we need to represent (k_min) such that there exist integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k_min} in [-x, x] for which:\n   S + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k_min} = 0\n\n This is equivalent to:\n   a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k_min} = -S\n\n We want the smallest k_min.\n\n Observation:\n Each additional card can contribute a value in the range [-x, x]. Therefore, the total sum we can achieve with k_min cards must lie in the interval [-k_min*x, k_min*x].\n\n Also, note that we can adjust the total by at least 1 (since we can use consecutive integers). However, the minimal k_min must satisfy:\n\n Condition 1: | -S | <= k_min * x   (because the total sum must be at least -k_min*x and at most k_min*x)\n\n But also, we must be able to form the exact value -S with k_min cards. Since we can choose any integer in [-x,x] for each card, the necessary and sufficient condition is:\n\n   k_min >= ceil(|-S| / x)   [if we were to use all cards to their maximum absolute value, we need at least this many]\n\n However, note that we can also use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily. Actually, the condition is:\n\n   k_min must be at least ceil(|S| / x) because the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n But wait, consider: if S=0, then we don't need any card. However, what if S is not zero?\n\n However, there's a catch: we might be able to use fewer than ceil(|S|/x) if we can use both positive and negative numbers? \n\n Actually, let me think: we are allowed to use any combination. The problem is similar to: what is the minimum k such that there exists k numbers (each between -x and x) that add up to -S.\n\n The necessary conditions are:\n   - The total must be -S, so the absolute value of the total is |S|.\n   - The total must be achievable by k cards: \n        k_min * (-x) <= -S <= k_min * x   =>   k_min >= ceil(|S| / x) ?\n\n But note: we are allowed to use positive and negative. Actually, the condition is:\n\n   k_min must be at least ceil(|S| / x) because the maximum absolute value we can cover with k_min cards is k_min*x (if we use one card with x and the others with 0 or adjusted appropriately, but note we can also use negatives). However, actually we can use negatives and positives arbitrarily.\n\n However, let me reframe: We wish to minimize k_min such that there exists k_min integers each in [-x,x] that sum to -S.\n\n This is equivalent to: we wish to minimize k_min such that there exists k_min integers a_i in [-x,x] with sum = -S.\n\n Conditions:\n   - The minimal k_min must be at least ceil(|S| / x) because if we use k_min cards, the maximum absolute value we can get is k_min*x (by using as large as possible in the direction of the needed sign). But note: we can also use opposite signs to cancel out. Actually, we can use a mix.\n\n However, consider: we can always use a card with value up to x and down to -x. The key is: we can achieve any integer value T such that |T| <= k_min*x and T ≡ k_min mod 1? Actually, no modulus condition because we can use any integers. But note: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x,x] so the step is 1. \n\n Actually, we can achieve any integer T such that |T| <= k_min*x and T has the same parity as k_min? Not exactly: because we can use any integers (so we can adjust by 1). Actually, no: the set of integers from -x to x includes both even and odd numbers? Actually, no: if x is integer, then the set is symmetric and we can use all integers from -x to x. So we can achieve any integer T such that |T| <= k_min*x? \n\n But wait, what if k_min=1? Then we can only achieve T in [-x, x]. What if k_min=2? Then we can achieve any integer T such that |T| <= 2*x? Actually, we can: because we can use two numbers, say a and b, and they can be any two integers in [-x,x]. The minimum sum is -2*x and the maximum is 2*x, and we can achieve every integer in between? Not necessarily: if x=1, then we can get from -2 to 2, which is all integers. But if x=2, then the two numbers can be from -2 to 2. Then the sums we can get are from -4 to 4. Can we get all integers? Yes, because we can use (0,0) for 0, (1,0) for 1, (-1,0) for -1, (1,1) for 2, (1,-1) for 0, etc.\n\n Actually, it is known that with k_min cards, each in [-x,x], we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k_min*x. Why?\n   We can use the following greedy: we can use one card to adjust by up to x, then another by up to x, etc. And because we can break down the adjustment by 1's (since we have consecutive integers) we can form every integer in the range.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: we can form T = -S if and only if |T| <= k_min*x.\n\n But note: we are free to choose the k_min. We wish to minimize k_min such that |S| <= k_min*x.\n\n However, wait: what if S is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n But there's a twist: what if we have some cards already? We don't have to use the found cards? Actually, the problem says: we have found n cards and we can find more. So the initial set is fixed and we can choose as many as we want from the infinite set.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\", meaning we start with the found ones and then we add.\n\n So we require k_min such that |S| <= k_min*x, and we want the minimum k_min (nonnegative integer) satisfying that.\n\n But wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then we need to add cards that sum to -S (which is positive). Similarly, if the current sum is positive, we need to add negative cards.\n\n Example: first sample: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> S = (-1+1+2)=2. Then we need to add cards that sum to -2. The minimal k_min is the smallest integer k_min such that k_min*x >= 2. Since x=2, then k_min=1 (because 1*2>=2).\n\n Example: second sample: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> S=-4. Then we need to add cards that sum to 4. The minimal k_min: 4 <= k_min*3 -> k_min >= ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n So the answer is: k_min = ceil(|S| / x) if |S|>0, but wait: what if |S| is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n However, let me test with |S|=1 and x=1: then k_min=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if |S|=0? Then ceil(0/x)=ceil(0)=0. Correct.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes we might need to use more than just the absolute value condition because the individual cards are bounded by x, but the above reasoning holds because we can form any integer in the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x]. So the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n Therefore, the answer is: \n   Let S = sum(found_cards)\n   If S == 0: then answer 0.\n   Else: \n        k_min = ceil(|S| / x)\n\n But wait, what if |S| is divisible by x? Then ceil(|S|/x) = |S|//x, which is an integer.\n\n However, let me check with the examples:\n\n Example 1: S=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n Example 2: S=-4, x=3 -> |S|=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n But wait, what if we have S=3 and x=2? Then ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then we need 2 cards. With two cards, we can get a sum from -4 to 4. We need 3. How? We can do 2+1 (but wait, 2 is allowed since x=2, so 1 is allowed). So 2+1=3. So yes.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the problem does not require the entire set of cards to be nonnegative or anything. We are allowed to use any integers in [-x,x]. So the above condition is sufficient.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   Read n and x.\n   Read the list of n integers.\n\n   S = sum(list)\n\n   If S == 0:\n        print(0)\n   Else:\n        # We need to compute ceil(|S| / x)\n        abs_S = abs(S)\n        # If abs_S is divisible by x, then we use abs_S // x, else floor division and add 1?\n        # Alternatively: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   when a and b are positive.\n\n        # But note: abs_S and x are positive.\n\n        # However, if abs_S % x == 0, then ceil(abs_S / x) = abs_S // x\n        # Otherwise, ceil(abs_S / x) = abs_S // x + 1\n\n        # But wait: what if x is 0? The problem states x>=1, so safe.\n\n        # Let k_min = (abs_S + x - 1) // x   [this is the ceiling division for positive numbers]\n\n        k_min = (abs_S + x - 1) // x\n\n        print(k_min)\n\n However, wait: let me test with abs_S=4, x=3: (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what if abs_S=3, x=3: (3+3-1)//3 = (5)//3 = 1 (in integer division) -> 5//3 is 1? That would be wrong because 3//3=1 and ceil(3/3)=1, so that's correct.\n\n But wait, 3/3=1, so ceil(1)=1. The formula (3+3-1)//3 = (5)//3 = 1 (since 5//3 is 1 in integer division). Correct.\n\n Another test: abs_S=5, x=3: (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2. ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> correct.\n\n But wait, is there a simpler way? We can use math.ceil, but note: abs_S/x might be float and we have to be cautious for large numbers? But n<=1000, x<=1000, so S is at most 1000*1000=1e6, which is acceptable for float, but integer arithmetic is better.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        k_min = (abs_S - 1) // x + 1   # This is also a common way to compute ceiling without converting to float.\n\n        Because: (abs_S - 1) // x gives floor((abs_S-1)/x), then adding 1 gives ceil(abs_S/x).\n\n        Example: abs_S=4, x=3: (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1, then +1 -> 2.\n                 abs_S=3, x=3: (3-1)//3=2//3=0, then +1 -> 1.\n                 abs_S=5, x=3: (5-1)//3=4//3=1, then +1 -> 2.\n\n        However, what if abs_S=0? Then (0-1)//x = (-1)//x. In Python, floor division for negative numbers rounds towards -infinity. But we are assuming abs_S>=0, so if S==0 we don't use this. For positive abs_S, this formula works.\n\n        But note: the problem states that the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value, and n>=1, so S could be negative? We take absolute value.\n\n        However, if S=0, we skip. So we are safe.\n\n        But the problem says: the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, and x>=1, so abs_S can be 0.\n\n        We already handled S==0.\n\n        But wait: what if abs_S is 0? Then we don't enter the else. So we don't use the formula for abs_S=0.\n\n        However, the problem says: the found cards have numbers from -x to x, so S can be zero.\n\n        So the above two methods are valid.\n\n        Let me choose the integer arithmetic method without floating point.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            if S == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_S = abs(S)\n                # Compute k_min = ceil(abs_S / x)\n                # Using: (abs_S + x - 1) // x   OR   (abs_S - 1) // x + 1\n\n        Both work, but the first one: (abs_S + x - 1) // x is standard ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n        However, note: if abs_S is very large, then (abs_S+x-1) might be very big, but within the limits (abs_S <= 1000*1000, which is 1e6, and x<=1000, so maximum 1e6+1000-1 ~ 1e6, which is acceptable in Python).\n\n        But I prefer the ceiling division formula: (abs_S + x - 1) // x\n\n        However, let me test with abs_S=1, x=1000: (1+1000-1)//1000 = 1000//1000 = 1 -> correct (ceil(1/1000)=1, but wait: ceil(0.001)=1? Actually, no: we need to form a total of 1. Since each card can be at most 1000, then one card of 1 is available (because 1 is in [-1000,1000]). So yes, we need one card. But the condition is that the total we need is 1, and one card can give 1. So the minimal k_min is 1.\n\n        But wait: is 1 in [-1000,1000]? Yes. So correct.\n\n        However, what if we need 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            total = sum(cards)\n\n            if total == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_total = abs(total)\n                # Calculate the minimal k_min such that k_min * x >= abs_total\n                # This is the ceiling of abs_total / x\n                k_min = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n                print(k_min)\n\n But wait, is that always true? Consider: we need to form a total of T = -total (which is non-zero). The minimal k_min is the smallest integer k_min such that there exists k_min integers in [-x,x] that sum to T. And the condition is that the absolute value of T must be <= k_min*x. And we can form T if |T|<=k_min*x. \n\n However, note: the condition |T| <= k_min*x is necessary and sufficient (as argued above). Therefore, the minimal k_min is indeed ceil(|T|/x) = ceil(|total|/x).\n\n But wait: what if T is negative? We take absolute value, so that doesn't matter.\n\n Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> total = -1+1+2=2, abs_total=2, k_min=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n Example 2: Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total=-4, abs_total=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n Another example: Input: \"1 10\\n0\" -> total=0, output 0. Correct.\n\n Example: \"1 10\\n5\" -> total=5, k_min=(5+10-1)//10 = (14)//10=1 -> output 1. Correct (we can use one card with -5).\n\n Example: \"2 10\\n5 5\" -> total=10, k_min=(10+10-1)//10 = 19//10=1 -> output 1? Wait, 10 is the total, and we can use one card of -10? But wait, the found cards are [5,5] (sum=10). Then we need to add cards that sum to -10. One card with -10 is allowed (since x=10). So correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have \"2 10\\n5 5\" and we have two cards and the total is 10. We need to add one card: -10. Then the total becomes 0.\n\n But what if the required total is 10 (positive) and we are allowed to use a card of -10? Yes.\n\n However, consider: \"2 10\\n5 6\" -> total=11, then k_min = (11+10-1)//10 = (20)//10=2. Then we need two cards. With two cards, the maximum absolute value we can get is 20, so we can form -11? We can use two cards: for example, -10 and -1. Or we can use one card of -10 and then we still need -1, which is available in one card. But wait: we are allowed to use two cards. We can use two cards: the first card can be -10 and the second card -1, so two cards. But the minimal k_min is 2. Correct.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the minimum number of cards. And 2 is the minimum because 1 card must be at least -10, but -11 is less than -10, so we cannot form -11 with one card. Therefore, two cards is the minimum.\n\n But wait: what if we use two cards: one of them is -10 and the other is -1, that's two cards. But we can also use two cards to form -11: for example, -6 and -5? But wait, we have two cards: the first card can be -6 and the second -5, but that's two cards and the sum is -11. But that's also two cards.\n\n However, the formula gives 2, which is correct.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: what if the required total is 1? Then we need one card of -1, which is allowed. But what if the required total is 2? Then one card of -2 is allowed if x>=2. But if x=1, then we cannot use a card of -2. Then we must use two cards: for example, -1 and -1.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: we can form T if |T| <= k_min*x, and we can form T if k_min>=ceil(|T|/x). \n\n However, in the case when x=1 and T=2: ceil(2/1)=2, so k_min=2, which is correct.\n\n But wait: the condition |T|<=k_min*x is necessary and sufficient. So the minimal k_min is indeed ceil(|T|/x). \n\n However, note: in the case T=2, x=1: we need two cards. But two cards can form a maximum absolute value of 2 (with two cards: 1+1=2, but wait: we need negative? Actually, we need to form -2? No, wait: we have a total S=2 (from the found cards) and we need to add cards that sum to -2. So we need to form -2. With two cards, each at least -1, the minimum sum is -2. So we can form -2.\n\n Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n But wait: what if the required total is 0? Then we use 0 cards.\n\n However, what if the required total is 1 and x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1, correct.\n\n Now, consider a tricky case: x=3, total=4 (so we need to form -4). Then k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. But can we form -4 with two cards? The two cards can be -3 and -1, so yes. Correct.\n\n But what if total=5 and x=3? Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. But with two cards, the maximum negative we can form is -6, so we can form -5? Yes: -3 and -2. So two cards is enough.\n\n However, what if total=6 and x=3? Then ceil(6/3)=2. But wait, two cards can form -6? Each card is at most -3, so two cards: -3 and -3 -> -6. So yes.\n\n But what if total=7 and x=3? Then ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Three cards: maximum negative is -9, and we need -7. We can do -3, -3, and -1. So three cards. Correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we try two cards for 7? Two cards: maximum negative is -6, which is less than -7. So we cannot form -7 with two cards.\n\n Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the required total is negative? We use absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(cards)\n   if s == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_s = abs(s)\n       k_min = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n       print(k_min)\n\n However, wait: there's a different perspective. The above formula gives the minimal k_min such that k_min*x >= abs_s. But note: the minimal k_min is the smallest integer k_min for which k_min*x >= abs_s. \n\n But is that the same as ceil(|s|/x)? Yes.\n\n But wait: what if abs_s is 0? Then we skip the else. So we are good.\n\n However, there is a possibility that we can use the same card multiple times? Yes, and the set is infinite. But our reasoning about the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x] being achievable is based on the fact that we can use any integers in [-x,x] arbitrarily. So the condition holds.\n\n But wait: what if we need to form a total T (which is negative) and we have a positive x? The absolute value condition is symmetric.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem statement example: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> output 1\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> output 2\n\n But wait, in the second example, the total is -4, and we need to add two cards (each at most 3). The two cards must sum to 4. The maximum we can get from two cards is 3+3=6, so 4 is within the range. And we can form 4: for example, 3 and 1, or 2 and 2, etc.\n\n But wait, the problem says: the found cards are [-2,-2] and we are adding two cards. The two cards must be chosen from the set of integers from -3 to 3. We need to form 4 (because the current sum is -4, so we need to add 4). And 3+1=4, and 1 and 3 are in [-3,3]. So two cards.\n\n However, the above code uses the absolute value of the total, which is 4, and then computes (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2.\n\n But wait: what if the total is negative? We take absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait, I see the example input is given as: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2'] and the expected outputs are ['1','2'].\n\n However, let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> sum = 2\n   then k_min = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer division, 3//2=1) -> output 1.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> sum = -4\n   abs_s=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n It matches.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\". The above code does not consider that we might already have some cards? But note: we are only concerned with the additional cards. The found cards are given and we are allowed to use them. The total S is the sum of the found cards, and we are going to add k_min cards (each from the infinite set) to make the total 0.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the current sum S is not zero, but we can use the found cards to adjust the needed total? Actually, the problem says: we can use the found cards (they are already there) and then we can find more cards. The goal is to have the overall sum zero.\n\n Our approach: We compute the total of the found cards (S) and then we need to add k_min cards such that the total becomes 0. So the additional cards must sum to -S.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we can use the found cards again? The problem says: we have found n cards, and we can find more (from the infinite set). The found cards are already present. We don't remove them. So we are adding to the existing set.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait, there's one more thing: the problem says \"the only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.\" So the additional cards can be any integer in [-x,x]. \n\n Therefore, the answer is the ceiling of (|S|/x) if S !=0, and 0 otherwise.\n\n However, wait: what if S=0? Then we don't need to add any card, so 0.\n\n But what if S is negative? We use absolute value.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       # Take absolute value\n       abs_s = abs(s)\n       # Calculate the minimal number of cards: ceil(|s|/x)\n       # Using integer arithmetic for ceiling division: (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n       print((abs_s + x - 1) // x)\n\n But wait: the example \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" has s=-4, so abs_s=4, and (4+3-1)=6, 6//3=2.\n\n However, wait: there is a possibility that we can use fewer cards if we consider that the additional cards can be chosen arbitrarily (including zeros) but the condition is the same: we need to achieve a total of -s (which is 4). \n\n But note: we can also use negative and positive cards arbitrarily. The condition is that the total must be 4. We can use two cards: one card of 3 and one card of 1. Or two cards of 2 each. \n\n So the above reasoning holds.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and we are computing the minimal k_min such that k_min*x >= |s|. But is that the minimal k_min? \n\n Yes, because if k_min*x < |s|, then we cannot achieve the total (since the maximum absolute value we can form with k_min cards is k_min*x, and |s| is greater than that). And if k_min*x >= |s|, then we can achieve the total (as argued: we can form any integer in the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x]).\n\n Therefore, the minimal k_min is the smallest integer such that k_min*x >= |s|, which is ceil(|s|/x).\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the ceiling division formula: (abs_s + x - 1) // x is standard and works for positive abs_s and x.\n\n But wait: what if abs_s is 0? Then we skip the else, so no problem.\n\n We assume x>=1, so no division by zero.\n\n Let me run one more test: \n   n=1, x=1, cards=[0] -> s=0 -> output 0.\n   n=1, x=1, cards=[1] -> s=1, then k_min=(1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> output 1.\n\n   n=1, x=1, cards=[2] -> wait, but the problem says: the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. So x=1, then the card must be in [-1,1]. So 2 is invalid. But the input guarantee: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\"\n\n   So we don't have to worry about numbers outside [-x,x].\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the first line contains n and x, and the second line contains n integers.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n        \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n   This means: first token is n=3, then x=2, then the next line has 3 integers.\n\n But our code reads the first two integers from the first line, and then the next line as the list.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_s = abs(s)\n       print((abs_s + x - 1) // x)\n\n But wait: what if the total is negative? We take absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n However, wait: the example input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" has two cards. The sum is -4, and we need to add two cards. The code prints 2.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\", and the answer is 2.\n\n However, wait: the example input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" is provided as a string. Our code reads the first two tokens from the first line: \"2\" and \"3\", then the next line: ['-2','-2'] -> converted to integers: [-2,-2].\n\n So the code is reading correctly.\n\n But wait: what if the input is given without spaces? The problem says: the second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value. So if x=3, then -2 and -2 are within [-3,3]. Correct.\n\n I think we are done.\n\n But wait: let me check the constraints: n from 1 to 1000, x from 1 to 1000. Our code uses O(n) for the sum, which is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the sum of n numbers each at most 1000 in absolute value: maximum absolute sum is 1000*1000=1000000, which is an integer, and we are doing integer arithmetic.\n\n Therefore, the code is efficient.\n\n Let me submit the code as is.\n\n But wait: wait, wait! There is a mistake: the problem says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", and we are computing the minimal k_min such that the additional cards sum to -S. \n\n However, note: the found cards are already there. The total of the found cards is S. We are going to add k_min cards (each from the infinite set) to make the total 0. \n\n But wait: what if we can use the found cards again? The problem does not say we can use the found cards again. It says we have found n cards, and we can find more. So the found cards are fixed and we cannot change them. We are only adding more cards.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning is correct.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says: \"Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\" and he found n of them. So the n found cards are distinct from the infinite set? Actually, the problem says: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\" and then \"he only found n of them\". \n\n But note: the found cards are part of that infinite set. And we can find more from the same infinite set. \n\n So the set of available cards is the same for the additional ones. \n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have a found card that is already the desired value? We cannot use it again? Actually, the problem does not specify that we cannot use duplicate cards. And since we are allowed to use the infinite set arbitrarily, we can use the same card value multiple times.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: consider the following scenario: \n   n=1, x=1, cards=[1] -> total=1, then we need to add one card: -1. But the found card was 1, and we are allowed to use the infinite set to get another -1. \n\n But note: the problem does not say we cannot use the same card value again. The set is infinite, so we have an infinite supply of each card.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have a found card that is the same as one we need to add? We don't care because we are only counting the number of cards we need to add.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_s = abs(s)\n       # Ceiling division: (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n       print((abs_s + x - 1) // x)\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative solution that considers the possibility of using the found cards to cancel each other? \n\n Actually, note: the problem says we are allowed to use the found cards (they are already there) and then we can add more. We don't remove any found card. \n\n So the total is fixed by the found cards and the added cards.\n\n Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if we don't need to cancel the entire sum? For example, if we have a found card that is 3 and x=3, and we need to cancel 3, we can use one card of -3. But what if we have two cards: one 3 and one -3? Then the total is 0 and we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards becomes zero. Each additional card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. If the current sum of the found cards is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, we need to find the smallest number of cards such that their combined sum equals the negative of the current sum.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the current sum divided by the maximum absolute value of a card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most ±x towards balancing the sum. The ceiling function ensures we account for any fractional part when dividing the absolute sum by x.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves calculating the sum of the found cards. If the sum is zero, the answer is zero. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of the sum and apply ceiling division by x to get the minimal number of cards needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_total = abs(total)\n        k_min = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards (n), the maximum absolute value of any card (x), and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the output is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: If the sum is non-zero, the absolute value of the sum is taken. The minimal number of additional cards required is calculated using ceiling division, which ensures that even if the sum is not perfectly divisible by x, we account for the remainder by rounding up.\n4. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of additional cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards.",
