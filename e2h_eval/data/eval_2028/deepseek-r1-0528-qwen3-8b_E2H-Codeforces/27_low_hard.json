On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. After the reversal, we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Observation:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n The entire sequence is non-decreasing if it is all 1's or all 2's or a mix (with all 1's first then 2's). However, note that we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval.\n\n Without any reversal, the original sequence has some LNDS. But we can also consider reversing a segment.\n\n Let's denote:\n   total_ones = total number of 1's in the whole array.\n   total_twos = total number of 2's (which is n - total_ones)\n\n In the best scenario, we would like to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and as many 2's as possible at the end.\n\n Note: Reversing an interval might change the order of 1's and 2's. But note that the reversal operation only reverses a contiguous part.\n\n Consider what happens when we reverse [l, r]:\n   The part from l to r is flipped. So, if originally the segment had some ones and twos, after flipping the ones and twos in the segment are swapped? Actually, no: the reversal doesn't change the values of the elements, but the order of the elements is reversed.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say to swap the values, but to reverse the order. So the elements remain the same numbers, but their positions change.\n\n Example: [1,2,1,2] -> reverse [2,3]: becomes [1, 1, 2, 2] (because the second element was 2, third was 1, so after reversing they become 1 then 2).\n\n So, the reversal is just about the order of the elements.\n\n How does this affect the entire sequence?\n\n We can think of the entire sequence as being composed of three parts:\n   Part 1: [0, l-1] (unchanged)\n   Part 2: [l, r] (reversed)\n   Part 3: [r+1, n-1] (unchanged)\n\n But note: the reversal operation doesn't change the set of numbers in the segment. So the multiset of 1's and 2's in the entire sequence remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the entire sequence still has total_ones ones and total_twos twos.\n\n The goal is to arrange the ones and twos so that the longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible.\n\n In fact, the entire sequence can be split into two parts: the left part (before the reversed segment) and the right part (after the reversed segment). And the reversed segment is inserted in between.\n\n However, note that the reversal might help to merge the left and right parts better. Specifically, we can try to move some 1's from the right to the left and some 2's from the left to the right.\n\n But note: the reversal operation flips the segment. So if the segment originally had a pattern, after reversal the pattern is inverted.\n\n Important: Since the array only has 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we can have a sequence that is all 1's then all 2's.\n\n Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS we can get is at most (total_ones + total_twos) = n, but if we can form a sequence that is all 1's then all 2's, then the entire sequence is non-decreasing and the answer is n.\n\n However, we may not be able to get the entire sequence as non-decreasing because the reversal is limited to one contiguous segment.\n\n But note: we can choose any contiguous segment to reverse. So we are allowed to rearrange one contiguous segment arbitrarily (but actually, we can only reverse it, so the relative order of the ones and twos within the segment is reversed).\n\n However, wait: reversing a contiguous segment of 1's and 2's is equivalent to swapping the positions of the ones and twos that are in the segment? Not exactly: the reversal changes the order. But note: the multiset of the segment is fixed. So we cannot change the count of 1's and 2's, only their order.\n\n But note: if we reverse the entire array, then the entire sequence is reversed. Then we might get a sequence that is more conducive to having all the 1's at the beginning and 2's at the end.\n\n However, sometimes we don't need to reverse the entire array. We might reverse a segment that is located in the middle.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the array is small (n <= 2000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the optimal arrangement of the sequence will have all 1s followed by all 2s, which would make the entire sequence non-decreasing. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence is simply a sequence of 1s followed by 2s. Therefore, the goal is to maximize the number of 1s at the beginning and 2s at the end by reversing a suitable subarray.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal solution involves transforming the sequence into a form where all 1s precede all 2s. The reversal of a subarray can help in moving 1s from the right part of the sequence to the left and 2s from the left to the right.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Count Total 1s and 2s**: Calculate the total number of 1s (`total_ones`) and 2s (`total_twos`) in the sequence.\n   - **Find Optimal Reversal**: For each possible starting index `i`, consider reversing a subarray starting at `i` and determine the best ending index `j` such that the reversed segment maximizes the number of 1s at the beginning and 2s at the end.\n   - **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Selection**: Use a greedy approach to track the positions of 1s and 2s, ensuring that the reversed segment helps in aligning as many 1s as possible to the left and 2s to the right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if total_ones == 0:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    best = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        ones_needed = total_ones\n        j = i\n        while j < n and prefix_ones[j+1] - prefix_ones[i] < ones_needed:\n            j += 1\n        if j < n:\n            candidate = prefix_ones[j+1] - prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[j+1]\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    if best == 0:\n        best = total_ones + total_twos\n        \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input values, including the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If there are no 1s in the sequence, the answer is simply the length of the sequence since all elements are 2s, which is already non-decreasing.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: \n   - `prefix_ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.\n   - `suffix_twos` array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end.\n4. **Finding Optimal Reversal**: For each starting index `i`, the code checks how far it needs to extend to include enough 1s. The candidate value is the sum of 1s from the starting index to the found position plus the 2s from that position onwards.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value encountered during the iteration is printed as the result, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequence achievable after reversing any subarray.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages prefix sums to quickly compute necessary counts and ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint `n <= 2000`.",
