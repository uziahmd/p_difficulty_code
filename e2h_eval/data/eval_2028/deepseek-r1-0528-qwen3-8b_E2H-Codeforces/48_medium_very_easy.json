He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers a and b, or one integer a and one string which is either an integer or 'R' (for Roman numerals).\n Then, the next line is a non-negative integer c in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000) that might be represented as a string.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line and split it.\n 2. The first token is always an integer `a` (base). The second token is either an integer `b` or the string 'R'.\n 3. Read the next line which is the number `c` in base `a`.\n\n If the second token is not 'R', then we need to convert the number from base `a` to base `b` (both integers between 2 and 25).\n\n But note: the input representation for base `a` might have digits beyond 9? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" \n So, the given string `c` is in base `a` and uses digits from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' onward if necessary. However, the input for base `a` (the string `c`) might have been provided with these letters.\n\n However, note: the input says \"a non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\", and the example includes base 12 and digit 'A'.\n\n But there's a catch: the problem states that the number is non-negative and may be up to 10^15^10 in non-Roman cases? Actually, wait: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that seems like a typo. Probably they meant 10^15 or something else? But note: the length of the string c is at most 1000, so the number can be very large (up to a^1000). However, the condition says: \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — actually, I think that part is confusing. Let me re-read:\n\n \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\"\n\n This seems to be a mistake. Actually, the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\" — wait, wait, the problem says the length is at most 1000? Actually, the problem says: \"its length doesn't exceed 103\" in the example input description? Let me check the problem statement.\n\n Correction: The problem states: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\"\n\n But wait, in the example input, we have: '2 2\\n1111001' — that's 7 digits. So, the maximum length is 103.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — this is probably a typo. They likely mean that without Roman numerals, the number is not too big (but we are only converting from base a to base b, and a,b between 2 and 25, and the string length is at most 103). We must handle very large numbers? But note: the conversion from base a to base 10 (as an integer) might be huge (since the string length is 103 and base a can be up to 25, so the maximum value is 25^103 which is astronomical). However, the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that is still huge. But wait, 10^15^10 is 10^(15*10) = 10^150, and 25^103 is about 10^(103*log10(25)) ~ 10^(103*1.4) ~ 10^144, which is less than 10^150. So the guarantee holds.\n\n However, we cannot convert such a big number by converting the entire string to an integer in base 10 because the number is too big for standard integers in Python? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we can handle the conversion from base a to base 10 as an integer, but then converting from base 10 to base b (which is at most 25) would require handling very big integers. But note: the problem says the number (without Roman) is at most 10^15^10, which is 10^150, and we are to convert to base b (which is small, between 2 and 25). We can do this by repeated division? But 10^150 is a very big integer, but Python can handle it. However, the input string is given in base a (with up to 103 digits) and we are to convert that to base b.\n\n Alternatively, we can convert the string from base a to an integer (using base conversion) and then from base 10 to base b. But note: the input string might have letters (like 'A') for digits beyond 9. \n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: b is not 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the string `c` from base `a` (which is an integer) to a base-10 integer.\n        - We can map each character in the string to a digit: if the char is between '0' and '9', then digit = int(char); if between 'A' and ... then digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\n   But note: the base `a` is at least 2 and at most 25. So the valid digits in the string `c` must be from '0' to the digit representing (a-1). For example, if a=16, then digits go from '0' to 'F' (which is 15). Since a<=25, the maximum digit is 24, which is represented by 'O'? Actually, we have to represent digits from 0 to 24. We can use:\n\n        digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRQSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n   But wait: the problem says that in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. However, the input string `c` is given in base `a`, so the digits must be in the set {0,1,...,a-1}. We have to validate that? The problem says \"non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume the string only contains valid digits for base a.\n\n   Step 2: Convert the base-10 integer to base `b` (integer between 2 and 25). We do this by repeatedly dividing by `b` and collecting remainders.\n\n   However, note: the base-10 integer might be 0. Then we output \"0\".\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   Then we have to convert the number (from base a) to a Roman numeral.\n\n   But note: the problem guarantees that if Roman numerals are used, the number is between 1 and 300010 (inclusive).\n\n   Steps for Roman conversion:\n        We have to convert the base-10 integer (obtained from the string in base `a`) to a Roman numeral.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\". So we can safely convert from base a to base 10, then to Roman.\n\n   But note: the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and the string length is at most 103. However, the guarantee says that when we are in the Roman case, the number is <= 300010. So even though the string length is 103, the actual number (when converted to base10) is at most 300010. Therefore, we can convert the entire string to a base10 integer and then to Roman.\n\n   However, if the string represents 0, then we should output nothing? But the problem says the number is non-negative and in the Roman case it won't be 0. So we don't have to worry about 0 in Roman.\n\n   Steps for converting base10 integer to Roman:\n\n        We know the rules: \n          I: 1\n          IV: 4\n          V: 5\n          IX: 9\n          X: 10\n          XL: 40\n          L: 50\n          XC: 90\n          C: 100\n          CD: 400\n          D: 500\n          CM: 900\n          M: 1000\n\n        And numbers up to 300010.\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones. But 300010 is three hundred thousand, so we need to extend the Roman numeral system to 300,000.\n\n        Actually, the problem says the number is up to 300010. The standard Roman numerals go up to 3999, but the problem goes up to 300010.\n\n        How to handle numbers above 3999?\n        One common way is to use a bar over the numeral to multiply by 1000, but the problem does not specify that. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300,010.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the number into parts: hundreds of thousands, ten thousands, etc. But note: we are limited by the standard symbols? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended system, and the maximum is 300010, we can simply use the standard system for numbers below 4000 and then handle the rest by breaking into thousands.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300,000 + 10. We can represent 300,000 as \"C\" repeated 300 times? That would be inefficient. Alternatively, we can use the standard way for 300,000: \"C\" is 100, so 300000 is 3 * 100000. But we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        There is no standard symbol for 100000. But note: the problem says \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — that was for the input representation, not for Roman.\n\n        However, looking at the example: \"16 R\\n5\" -> 'V', and \"5 R\\n4\" -> 'IV'. So we are to use the standard Roman numerals.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals do not have a direct symbol for 100000. But the problem says the number is at most 300010. We can use the additive principle: \n          300000 = CCCCC... (300 Cs) but that is not practical.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n\n        Since the number is at most 300010, we can break it as:\n\n          300010 = 300000 + 10\n\n        And for 300000, we can use the same method as 300: CCC, but then followed by how many thousands? Actually, 300000 = 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is up to 300010, so we can use:\n\n        We can define the Roman numerals for numbers up to 300000 by using the standard symbols and then for the thousands beyond 3999, we can use a bar or just repeat the M? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. However, the example only goes up to 300010, which is 300,010.\n\n        Another idea: use the standard rule for numbers below 4000, and for numbers above 3999, we break the number as:\n\n          n = d * 1000 + r   [where d is the thousands part and r is the remainder]\n\n        Then represent d as a Roman numeral (using the standard rules for numbers 1 to 3999) and then add a bar over d? But the problem doesn't mention bars.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: for numbers above 1000, we can use the same symbols but in multiples. But the standard subtractive principle doesn't extend arbitrarily.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — that's only for the input representation. The output for Roman should be the standard Roman numerals.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify an extended system. Since 300010 is 300,010, we can write:\n\n          300,000: three hundred thousand. We can use CCC (for 300) and then M repeated 0 times? Actually, we can use M for 1000, so 300000 is 300 * 1000. But we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        But wait, the standard way is to use the same symbols and the same subtractive rules for each power. However, the standard Roman numerals only go up to 3999. For numbers beyond, they sometimes use parentheses or bars, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        However, note the example input: the Roman case numbers are guaranteed to be <= 300010. So we can break the number into:\n\n          thousands: floor(n / 1000)   [this gives a number from 0 to 300]\n          remainder: n % 1000\n\n        Then, represent the thousands part as a Roman numeral (each M is 1000, so 300 thousands would be 300 Ms? That would be 300 'M's, but then 300000 is 300 Ms. But that is 300 characters, which is acceptable since the problem does not specify a limit on the length of the Roman numeral.\n\n        However, 300010 would be 300 Ms and then \"X\", so total 300010 is represented as 300 'M's and then \"X\".\n\n        But wait: 300000 is 300 * 1000, so we can use 300 Ms. Similarly, 4000 would be MMMM? But standard subtractive for thousands: 4000 is usually written as MMMM or sometimes as IV with a bar (IV̅) but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        The problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed\", meaning that for thousands, we use M for 1000, and 4000 is written as MMMM (without subtractive because 4 is represented as IIII? Actually, no: the standard subtractive principle for thousands is not defined beyond 3999. But the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't have to worry about 4000.\n\n        Actually, 300010 is 300,010. We can break it as:\n\n          300000: we can use the standard way for thousands: \n            We know that 1000 is M, 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM, 4000 is MMMM (but we don't need to go beyond 300000).\n\n        However, 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can write 300 Ms? Or we can break 300000 as 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Alternative approach: use the standard method for converting numbers to Roman by processing from highest to lowest, but extending the list of symbols for thousands.\n\n        Let me define the Roman numeral conversion for numbers up to 300010:\n\n        We'll consider the number as having up to 6 digits (since 300010 has 6 digits). We can break the number into:\n\n          hundreds of thousands: n // 100000 * 100000 -> but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Instead, we can break the number by powers of 10, but we have to handle the thousands (10^3) separately.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion (without bars, just standard):\n\n        Actually, the problem's example inputs are small (like 5, 4). We can use a greedy algorithm that uses the following mapping:\n\n        We'll define a list of tuples (value, symbol) from highest to lowest:\n\n        For numbers up to 300010, we can include:\n\n          [('M', 1000), ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400), ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), \n           ('L', 50), ('XL', 40), ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)]\n\n        But wait, 1000 is M, then 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM, 4000 is not covered (we don't need 4000 because our number is <=300010). \n\n        However, 300000 is 300 * 1000, so we can use 'M' 300 times. But that is 300 characters. The problem does not restrict the length.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more efficient representation for thousands: but the problem doesn't specify, so we use the standard.\n\n        Algorithm for converting base10 integer to Roman:\n\n          def to_roman(n):\n            # n is an integer between 1 and 300010\n            roman_map = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900),\n                ('D', 500),\n                ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100),\n                ('XC', 90),\n                ('L', 50),\n                ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10),\n                ('IX', 9),\n                ('V', 5),\n                ('IV', 4),\n                ('I', 1)\n            ]\n            roman_chars = []\n            for numeral, value in roman_map:\n                while n >= value:\n                    roman_chars.append(numeral)\n                    n -= value\n            return ''.join(roman_chars)\n\n        But wait, what about 4000? Our n is at most 300010, so we don't need to represent 4000. However, 300000: \n          We have 300000 // 1000 = 300, so we will use 'M' 300 times. That is acceptable.\n\n        However, let's test with n=300000: \n          It will match 'M' 300 times, so the result is 300 'M's.\n\n        Example: 300010 -> 300000 (300 Ms) and then 10 (one 'X').\n\n        But wait, 300010: \n          Start with 300000: subtract 1000 300 times -> 300 Ms, then 10 left -> then we use 'X'. So \"M\"*300 + \"X\"\n\n        However, the example input \"16 R\\n5\" is 5, which is 'V'. And \"5 R\\n4\" is 'IV'. So the function should work for numbers up to 300010.\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem also says the number is non-negative and in the Roman case it won't be 0.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Steps:\n\n  Read first line: tokens = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n      a_str, b_str = tokens[0], tokens[1] if len(tokens)==2 else ...\n\n  Then read the next line: s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n  Convert the string s from base a (given by the integer a) to a base10 integer.\n\n  How to convert base a string to integer?\n\n      We can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            # Map char to digit\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n            # But wait: the base a is given, so the digit must be less than a.\n            # However, the problem says the input is valid, so we assume each digit is in [0, a-1].\n\n            num = num * a + d\n\n        But note: the string might have leading zeros, and that's okay.\n\n  However, if the string is very long (up to 103 digits) and base a is 2, then the number is huge (2^103) but still within the limits of Python integers. But the problem says that without Roman, the number is at most 10^15^10 (which is 10^150) and 25^103 is about 10^144, so we are safe.\n\n  Then, if b_str is not 'R':\n\n        Convert the base10 integer to base b (integer). We have to do:\n\n        If the base10 integer is 0, then output \"0\"\n\n        Otherwise, we convert:\n\n            digits = []\n            n = base10_int\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(str(r))\n\n            Then reverse digits and combine. But note: the base b is between 2 and 25, so we can map the remainder to a digit.\n\n            However, if the remainder is >=10, we need to use letters.\n\n            We can create a string of digits for base up to 25:\n\n            digit_map = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRQSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n            But wait: base 16 uses 0-9 and A-F (which is 6 letters). We need up to base 25, so we need 25 digits: 0-9 and then A-O (15 letters) but 10+15=25.\n\n            So the mapping for remainders from 0 to 24: \n                0-9 -> '0' to '9'\n                10-24 -> 'A' to 'O'\n\n            However, the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12: 'A' is 10, so the number is 10 in base12, which is 10 in base10. Then convert 10 to base13: 10 < 13, so output 'A'. \n\n            But wait, the example input: \n                Input: ['12 13\\nA'] -> Output: ['A']\n\n            So we need to map the remainders as:\n\n            For base b, we use:\n\n            if r < 10: then str(r)\n            else: chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n            However, if b is 16, then we need to map up to 15, which is 'F'. But if b is 26, then we would need 'Z', but our b is at most 25.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            digits = []\n            if base10_int == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            n = base10_int\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(str(r) if r < 10 else chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n            Then we have to reverse the digits.\n\n  But wait: the above conversion for base10 to base b is standard. However, note: the problem says the base b is between 2 and 25, so we are safe.\n\n  However, the problem says the input number c is non-negative. We are converting from base a to base10 and then to base b. But note: if the original base a string is empty? The problem says non-negative integer, so minimum length is 1.\n\n  Edge: if the base10 integer is 0, then we output \"0\" (unless b is 'R', then we output nothing? But the problem says the Roman case number is not 0, so we don't have to worry about 0 in Roman).\n\n  But wait, what if the input string is \"0\" (all zeros)? Then base10_int becomes 0. Then if b is not 'R', we output \"0\". \n\n  However, the problem says the input c is non-negative and may contain leading zeros. So \"0\" is a valid input.\n\n  But note: the problem says in the Roman case the number is not 0, but in the non-Roman case, we can have 0.\n\n  So:\n\n      if b_str == 'R':\n          if base10_int == 0:\n              # According to the problem, in Roman case the number is not 0, so we don't expect this. But to be safe, we output nothing?\n              # However, the problem says the number in Roman case is not 0, so we assume base10_int>=1.\n              # But the problem says non-negative, so maybe 0 is allowed? But then the guarantee says \"it won't be 0\". So we don't have to handle 0 in Roman.\n          else:\n              roman_str = to_roman(base10_int)\n              print(roman_str)\n\n      else:\n          base_b = int(b_str)\n          if base10_int == 0:\n              print(\"0\")\n          else:\n              # Convert base10_int to base_b\n              digits_list = []\n              n = base10_int\n              while n:\n                  n, r = divmod(n, base_b)\n                  digits_list.append(str(r) if r < 10 else chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n              # We have to reverse because we built from least significant to most.\n              digits_list.reverse()\n              print(''.join(digits_list))\n\n  However, note: the example \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10: 1, base2: '1'\n\n  But wait: the example \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2: '1111001' is the same as base10? No, wait: the input is base2, so the string \"1111001\" in base2 is 121 in base10. Then we have to convert 121 to base2? Actually, no: the problem says:\n\n      Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! \n\n      Then: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n  So the input is a string in base a, and we have to output the same integer in base b.\n\n  Therefore, we must first convert the string from base a to base10, then from base10 to base b.\n\n  Example: \"2 2\\n1111001\"\n\n      base a = 2, base b = 2, string \"1111001\" in base2: \n          base10_int = 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121\n\n      Then convert 121 to base2: \n          121 // 2 = 60 remainder 1\n          60 // 2 = 30 remainder 0\n          30 // 2 = 15 remainder 0\n          15 // 2 = 7 remainder 1\n          7 // 2 = 3 remainder 1\n          3 // 2 = 1 remainder 1\n          1 // 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n          So the binary is 1111001, which is the same as the input.\n\n      But wait, the example output is '1111001'. So we are just echoing the same string? Because base a and base b are the same.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, note: the example \"12 13\\nA\": \n        base a = 12, string \"A\" in base12: A is 10, so base10_int = 10.\n        Then convert 10 to base13: 10 < 13, so we use the digit for 10, which is 'A'.\n\n  So output is 'A'.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Read first line and split.\n      Read the next line (strip it)\n\n      a = int(tokens[0])\n      b_str = tokens[1]\n\n      s = input_string\n\n      # Convert string s from base a to base10 integer\n      base10_num = 0\n      for char in s:\n          if '0' <= char <= '9':\n              d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n          else:\n              d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n          # Check if d is less than a? The problem says the input is valid, so we assume it.\n          base10_num = base10_num * a + d\n\n      # Now, if b_str is 'R'\n      if b_str == 'R':\n          # According to the problem, base10_num is between 1 and 300010\n          # Convert base10_num to Roman\n          roman_map = [\n              ('M', 1000),\n              ('CM', 900),\n              ('D', 500),\n              ('CD', 400),\n              ('C', 100),\n              ('XC', 90),\n              ('L', 50),\n              ('XL', 40),\n              ('X', 10),\n              ('IX', 9),\n              ('V', 5),\n              ('IV', 4),\n              ('I', 1)\n          ]\n          roman_digits = []\n          for numeral, value in roman_map:\n              while base10_num >= value:\n                  roman_digits.append(numeral)\n                  base10_num -= value\n          roman_str = ''.join(roman_digits)\n          print(roman_str)\n\n      else:\n          b = int(b_str)\n          if base10_num == 0:\n              print(\"0\")\n          else:\n              digits_list = []\n              n = base10_num\n              while n:\n                  n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                  if r < 10:\n                      digits_list.append(str(r))\n                  else:\n                      digits_list.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n              # Reverse the digits_list\n              digits_list.reverse()\n              print(''.join(digits_list))\n\n  However, wait: the above base10 conversion from base a string might be incorrect because we are doing:\n\n        base10_num = base10_num * a + d\n\n  This is correct for the base conversion.\n\n  But note: the string might be given with leading zeros, and that's okay because we are processing the entire string.\n\n  Let me test with a small example: base2, string \"01\" -> \n        base10_num = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n  Another: base16, string \"10\" -> base10: 1*16 + 0 = 16.\n\n  But the example: base16, string \"5\" -> base10: 5.\n\n  Example: base16, string \"A\" -> base10: 10.\n\n  It's correct.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and the digits in the string must be in [0, a-1]. We assume the input is valid.\n\n  But what if the string contains a digit that is not valid for base a? The problem says it's valid, so we don't handle.\n\n  One more edge: if the string is empty? The problem says the length doesn't exceed 103, but minimum length is 1.\n\n  But note: the problem says non-negative integer, so the string could be \"0\", which is valid.\n\n  We have handled 0 in the non-Roman case.\n\n  However, what if the base10_num is 0 in the Roman case? The problem says the Roman case number is not 0, so we don't have to handle.\n\n  But to be safe, we can check: if base10_num==0 and b_str=='R', then output nothing? Or the problem says it won't be 0, so we assume base10_num>=1.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10: 1, base2: '1' -> output '1'\n\n      Example 2: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base16: '5' -> base10: 5, then to Roman: 'V' -> output 'V'\n\n      Example 3: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base5: '4' -> base10: 4, then to Roman: 'IV' -> output 'IV'\n\n      Example 4: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2: '1111001' -> base10: 121, base2: 121 in base2 is '1111001' -> output '1111001'\n\n      Example 5: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12: 'A' -> base10: 10, base13: 10 -> 'A'\n\n  All examples match.\n\n  However, note: the example \"16 R\\n5\" and \"5 R\\n4\" — the base a is 16 and 5 respectively. The input string is a single digit.\n\n  But wait, the example input format: the first line has two tokens. The example input is given as:\n\n      ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n  So the first token is the base a, the second is the base representation type (either integer or 'R'), and then the next line is the string.\n\n  But note: the problem says the first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25) OR the second part is replaced by 'R",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, possibly including Roman numerals. The solution involves reading input values, converting the number from its given base to base 10, and then converting it to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the source base (a) and the target base or representation (b). The second line contains the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string from the source base (a) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, mapping it to its numerical value, and accumulating the result by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit's value.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target is 'R', convert the base 10 integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols. This involves iterating through the mapping list and subtracting the largest possible values from the number while appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target is a standard base (integer between 2 and 25), convert the base 10 integer to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to digits (0-9 followed by letters A-O for values 10-24).\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero (output \"0\" for non-Roman bases) and ensure Roman numeral conversion adheres to the problem constraints (numbers up to 300,010).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    a_str = data[0]\n    b_str = data[1] if len(data) > 1 else None\n\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n\n    base10_num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        \n        base10_num = base10_num * a + d\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_map = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900),\n            ('D', 500),\n            ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90),\n            ('L', 50),\n            ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9),\n            ('V', 5),\n            ('IV', 4),\n            ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        roman_digits = []\n        for numeral, value in roman_map:\n            while base10_num >= value:\n                roman_digits.append(numeral)\n                base10_num -= value\n        roman_str = ''.join(roman_digits)\n        print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except Exception:\n            print(\"Invalid base\")\n            return\n\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits_list = []\n            n = base10_num\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits_list.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits_list.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n            digits_list.reverse()\n            print(''.join(digits_list))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two tokens from the first line (source base `a` and target base `b`) and the number string from the second line.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The input string is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its numerical value (handling digits 0-9 and letters A-O for values 10-24). The accumulated value is built by iteratively multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit's value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard bases, the number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected. These remainders are converted to digits (0-9 or letters A-O) and reversed to form the final result.\n5. **Edge Cases**: The code handles zero values by outputting \"0\" for non-Roman bases and ensures Roman numeral conversion works for numbers up to 300,010 as specified.",
