    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string s which is the binary representation of m (without spaces)\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as the sum of a_i for every bit i that is set in x.\n        However, note that the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the binary representation of m \n        is given as a string of length n (so m has exactly n bits, from least significant bit (rightmost) to most significant (leftmost)).\n\n But note: the example input says:\n      Input: \n          2\n          3 8\n          10\n\n      Here, n=2, so the array a has two elements: [3,8]\n      The binary representation of m is \"10\", which is 2 in decimal. So m=2.\n\n      Then, x can be 0, 1, 2 (since 0<=x<=2). But note: the problem states that the binary representation is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} without spaces, and then m = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i * 2^i.\n\n      However, wait: in the example, the binary representation string \"10\" has two characters. Then m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n      And the function f(x) for x=0: 0 -> no bits set -> 0.\n                 x=1: 1 in binary is '01' (with two bits) -> but note: the problem uses the binary representation of x having exactly n bits? \n\n      Actually, note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. But the array a has n elements, and the bits considered are from 0 to n-1 (so the i-th element a_i corresponds to the i-th bit, which is 2^i).\n\n      However, the problem says: \"value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\".\n\n      But note: the example input says that the second sample is:\n\n          Input:\n              5\n              17 0 10 2 1\n              11010\n\n          Here, n=5, so the array a has 5 elements. The binary representation of m is \"11010\", which has 5 digits. Then m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n      However, the example output is 27, which is achieved by x=5 (binary '00101' with 5 bits? but wait, 5 is 101 in base2, so we need to represent x in n bits?).\n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"the binary representation of number x\" — but note that x can have more than n bits? However, m is given by a binary string of length n, so the maximum value for x is m (which is at most 2^n - 1). But note: the array a only has n elements, so the function f(x) only considers bits from 0 to n-1. Therefore, we can consider x in the range [0, m] (and m < 2^n) because the binary representation of m has n bits.\n\n      Important: We are to consider the bits from 0 to n-1 (the least significant bit is the 0-th). The function f(x) is the sum of a_i for every bit i that is set in x.\n\n      Since we cannot iterate over all x from 0 to m (because m can be up to 2^n - 1, and n can be up to 10^5), we must use a smarter method.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can think of the problem as: we have a fixed set of bits (from 0 to n-1) and each bit i has a weight a_i. We are allowed to set bits in x only if the resulting number is <= m.\n\n This is similar to digit dynamic programming (digit DP) or greedy bit setting.\n\n However, note: we want to maximize the sum of a_i for the bits we set. So we would like to set as many high a_i bits as possible. But sometimes we cannot set a higher bit because of the constraint of m.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let the binary representation of m be stored in a list (or string) `s` of length n, where the first character (index 0) is the most significant bit (bit n-1) and the last character (index n-1) is the least significant bit (bit 0).\n\n But note: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (for i from 0 to n-1) and the i-th bit is the one that is multiplied by 2^i. In the binary representation string, the i-th character (from left to right) corresponds to the bit (n-1-i) because:\n\n   Example: n=5, m=26 -> binary string \"11010\"\n\n   Then, the bits (from low to high) are:\n        bit0 (LSB): the last character '0'\n        bit1: the second last '1'\n        bit2: the third last '0'\n        bit3: the fourth last '1'\n        bit4 (MSB): the first character '1'\n\n   So the binary string we are given is from MSB to LSB.\n\n Alternatively, we can reverse the string to get the bits from LSB to MSB.\n\n However, note: the problem defines the function f(x) by the bits of x. The standard way is to consider the binary representation of x from LSB to MSB, but our m is given in a string that is from MSB to LSB.\n\n We can process the bits from the most significant to the least significant (like in digit DP) and decide whether to set a bit or not.\n\n But note: the array a is given in the order a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. Here, a0 corresponds to the 0-th bit (LSB) and a_{n-1} corresponds to the (n-1)-th bit (MSB).\n\n However, wait: in the example, the array is [17, 0, 10, 2, 1] for n=5. Then:\n\n   f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\n   Why is that? Because 5 in binary (with 5 bits) is '00101'. So the bits set are the 0-th and the 2nd. Therefore, the array index 0 corresponds to the 0-th bit (LSB) and index 2 corresponds to the 2nd bit (which is the third from the right).\n\n So the array a is indexed by the bit position (from 0 to n-1). \n\n Now, the binary representation of m is given as a string of n characters (from MSB to LSB). We can map:\n\n   Let b[i] be the i-th character (0-indexed from left) of the binary string. Then, the bit represented by b[i] is the (n-1-i)-th bit (because the leftmost is the highest power, which is 2^(n-1-i)).\n\n Alternatively, we can index the bits from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB). Then:\n\n   For a bit position j (0 <= j < n), it appears in the binary representation of m at index n-1-j.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We can use a greedy strategy from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). However, note that we are constrained by m.\n\n Another idea: consider that without the constraint (x <= m), the maximum f(x) would be the sum of all a_i for which a_i > 0 (because we would set every bit that has positive a_i). But the constraint x<=m may force us to unset some bits.\n\n However, note that we can set a bit only if the entire number formed by the bits we set (including the ones we set in the lower bits) does not exceed m.\n\n We can use a digit DP that goes from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, and keeps track of whether we are already below m or not.\n\n But note: n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all states (like typical DP with state [position][tight] because the tight condition is just two states, but the state space is O(n) and we can do a linear DP).\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from the i-th bit (from the MSB side) to the end, given that we are in a state of being tight (meaning the prefix is equal to m's prefix) or not.\n\n However, we can also use a greedy approach:\n\n   We traverse the bits from the most significant to the least significant (i.e., from the highest power to the lowest). At each bit (which corresponds to a certain index in the array a, but note: the array a is given for bits 0 to n-1, and the bit positions we are processing are from n-1 down to 0?).\n\n   Actually, we have the array a and the binary representation of m (string s). We need to map:\n\n     Let b = list(s)  # this is the binary representation of m, from MSB to LSB.\n\n     Then, the j-th bit (as in the function f) is the bit at position j (0-indexed from LSB to MSB). But in the binary representation string, the bit at position j is stored at index (n-1-j).\n\n   So we can create an array `b_arr` of the same length as a (which is n) such that:\n\n        b_arr[j] = the j-th character of the binary string (which is the bit for the (n-1-j)-th position in m's representation) OR\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the function f(x) uses the bit i (from 0 to n-1). The constraint m is given by a binary string of length n (MSB first). The i-th bit (lowest bit is i=0) is the (n-1-i)-th character in the string.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let the binary string be stored in variable `s` (length n). Then, the bit for the i-th position (i from 0 to n-1) is the character at index n-1-i.\n\n   Then, we can process the bits from the highest power (i = n-1) down to 0.\n\n   However, note: the function f(x) is additive, so the contribution of each bit is independent, except for the constraint.\n\n   We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n        Without the constraint, we would set a bit i if a_i > 0, but we cannot set a bit i if setting it would make the number exceed m.\n\n   We can use a greedy method that starts from the highest bit (i = n-1) and goes down to 0.\n\n   Let `bits` = the binary representation of m (string of length n) and we'll consider the bits from the highest (at index0 of the string) to the lowest (index n-1).\n\n   But note: the highest bit (MSB) is the (n-1)-th bit (in terms of the function f, i.e., the bit corresponding to 2^(n-1)), and the lowest is the 0-th bit.\n\n   We can process the bits from the highest (i = n-1) to the lowest (i=0). However, the array a is given such that the j-th element a_j corresponds to the j-th bit (which is the bit with value 2^j). \n\n   So we need to associate:\n\n        Let `bit_index_in_a` = j corresponds to the j-th bit (LSB to MSB). Then, in the binary string, the j-th bit is at position n-1-j.\n\n   Now, the constraint: we cannot set a bit j (in the function f) arbitrarily because the entire number must be <= m.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n        Let `total` = 0\n        Let `tight` = True   (meaning we are matching m so far)\n\n        For bit_position from the highest (n-1) to the lowest (0):\n\n            current_bit = the bit in m at this position? Actually, we are traversing the binary string from left to right (from MSB to LSB). \n\n            But note: the highest bit (n-1) is the first character in the string. In the array a, the highest bit (n-1) is stored at a[n-1]. \n\n            However, wait: the function f(x) uses the bit i (from 0 to n-1). The highest bit is the (n-1)-th bit, which is stored at a[n-1].\n\n            But the array a is given as a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. So:\n\n                a0: bit0 (LSB)\n                a1: bit1\n                ...\n                a_{n-1}: bit_{n-1} (MSB)\n\n            Now, the binary string for m is given as the MSB first, so the first character is the bit_{n-1} (the highest bit) and the last character is the bit0 (the lowest bit).\n\n            So we can align:\n\n                Let `arr` = the array a, so arr[i] is the coefficient for the i-th bit (which is 2^i).\n\n                Let `m_bits` = the given string (without spaces) of length n.\n\n            Then, we can iterate from the most significant bit (which is the (n-1)-th bit) to the least significant (0-th bit). \n\n            But note: the (n-1)-th bit is the highest, and its coefficient is arr[n-1]. \n\n            However, when we consider the constraint, we have to look at the bits from the highest to the lowest.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        We'll consider the bits from the highest (index n-1) to the lowest (index 0) in the array a, but the constraint bits are given in the string from MSB (n-1) to LSB (0) as well.\n\n        But note: the binary representation string is for m, and the i-th character (0-indexed) is the (n-1-i)-th bit of m (if we consider the bit positions from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the least significant). \n\n        Actually, the j-th bit (in the function f) is the bit that corresponds to 2^j. In the binary representation of m, the j-th bit (from the right) is the (n-1-j)-th character of the string.\n\n        Alternatively, let's define:\n\n            Let `m_bin` = the given binary string (length n)\n\n            Then, for a given bit position j (0-indexed from the right, so j=0 is the least significant), the bit value in m is `m_bin[n-1-j]`.\n\n        But we are going to process from the most significant (j = n-1) to the least significant (j=0). \n\n        However, note that the constraint is: we cannot set a bit j if the bits we set from the most significant to j (inclusive) would form a number greater than m.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            Let `ans` = 0\n            Let `tight` = True   (we are matching m so far)\n\n            We consider the bits from the highest (j = n-1) to the lowest (j=0):\n\n                Let `coeff` = arr[j]   (this is the value for the j-th bit, which is the bit corresponding to 2^j)\n\n                Let `bit_m` = the j-th bit in the function f's bit representation? Actually, we need the bit in m for the j-th bit (which is the (n-1-j)-th character in the string).\n\n            But wait: the j-th bit (in the function f) is the bit for 2^j. In the binary representation of m, the j-th bit is the (n-1-j)-th character. However, we are processing from the highest bit (which is j=n-1) to the lowest (j=0). \n\n            Alternatively, we can process the binary string from left to right (from the first character to the last) and at the same time consider the corresponding bit in the array a.\n\n            Let me re-index:\n\n                We have two arrays:\n\n                    a[0], a[1], ... , a[n-1]   -> coefficients for bits 0 to n-1 (LSB to MSB)\n\n                    m_bin[0], m_bin[1], ... , m_bin[n-1] -> bits for the number m, where m_bin[0] is the MSB (bit n-1) and m_bin[n-1] is the LSB (bit0).\n\n            Then, the bit for the (n-1)-th bit (MSB) is m_bin[0] and the coefficient for that bit is a[n-1].\n\n            Similarly, the bit for the 0-th bit (LSB) is m_bin[n-1] and the coefficient is a[0].\n\n            So we can process:\n\n                For i in range(n):\n                    current_bit_value = int(m_bin[i])   # this is the i-th character (from left) which is the bit for the (n-1-i)-th bit (in the function f, the bit position is (n-1-i))\n                    But wait, the function f uses the bit position (exponent) from 0 to n-1. The exponent is the same as the index in the array a.\n\n            Actually, we can create an array `coeff` for the bits from MSB to LSB? \n\n            Alternatively, we can process the bits from the most significant (which is the (n-1)-th bit) to the least significant (0-th bit) and use the corresponding coefficient from the array a.\n\n            We can precompute an array `b` of length n (same as a) for the coefficients, but then we need to know the constraint bit for the same bit.\n\n            Let me define:\n\n                Let `bits` = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))   # but wait, the input is given as a string without spaces.\n\n            Then, the constraint for the j-th bit (in the function f, j from 0 to n-1) is the bit at position n-1-j in the string.\n\n            But we are processing from the highest bit (j = n-1) to the lowest (j=0). \n\n            We can do:\n\n                Let `a_arr` = list of a (the array given)\n                Let `m_str` = the given binary string\n\n            Then, we process from the highest bit (which is the (n-1)-th bit) to the lowest (0-th bit):\n\n                index_in_m = n-1 - j   # but j is the bit position (from 0 to n-1) and we are starting from j = n-1 (the highest) and going down to 0.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate j from n-1 down to 0, and the constraint bit is m_str[j] (but wait: no, because the string is from MSB to LSB, so the first character is the highest bit (which is the (n-1)-th bit) and the last character is the 0-th bit. \n\n            Actually, if we let j be the index in the array a (from 0 to n-1) then the constraint bit for the j-th bit (which is the bit with weight 2^j) is the character at position n-1-j in the string.\n\n            But we are going to process from the highest bit (j=n-1) to the lowest (j=0). Then, the constraint bit for the j-th bit is m_str[n-1-j]?\n\n            Actually, let's map:\n\n                j (bit position) -> index in the string = n-1-j.\n\n            Then, for j from n-1 down to 0:\n\n                constraint_bit = m_str[n-1-j]\n\n            However, we can also precompute an array `constraint_bits` for each j from 0 to n-1:\n\n                constraint_bits[j] = m_str[n-1-j]\n\n            Then, we can iterate j from n-1 down to 0 and use:\n\n                coeff = a_arr[j]\n                bit_m = constraint_bits[j]   # but wait, j is the bit position (from 0 to n-1) and we are iterating from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            But note: the constraint_bits[j] is the j-th bit in the function f's bit representation? Actually, no: the constraint_bits[j] is the bit in m for the j-th bit (which is the same as the j-th bit in the function f). \n\n            However, we are processing the bits from the highest (j=n-1) to the lowest (j=0). \n\n            Now, the algorithm:\n\n            We are going to consider two possibilities for each bit: set it or not, but the constraint may force us to not set it if we are still tight and the constraint bit is 0.\n\n            However, we want to maximize the sum. \n\n            Standard approach for such problems (like \"Digit DP\"):\n\n                Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can get from the i-th bit (considering the bits from i to 0, i.e., from the (n-1-i)-th bit to the 0-th bit) given that we are in a state of `tight` (whether the prefix is equal to m's prefix).\n\n            But note: we are processing from the highest bit (which is the (n-1)-th bit) to the lowest (0-th). However, the constraint_bits for the j-th bit (when j is the bit position) is the (n-1-j)-th character in the string.\n\n            Alternatively, we can process the string from left to right (the most significant first) and consider the bit positions from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            Let's define:\n\n                Let `dp[i][tight]` where i is the current bit index (from 0 to n) in the constraint_bits (which is the same as the array a index from n-1 down to 0) — but we are going to use the same index for the array a.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                Let `arr` = the array a (n elements) and `m_arr` = the array of constraint bits for each j (0-indexed from 0 to n-1) which is [m_str[n-1], m_str[n-2], ..., m_str[0]]? \n\n            Wait, no: the constraint_bits for the j-th bit (which is the bit with weight 2^j) is the character at position n-1-j in the original string. \n\n            We can precompute:\n\n                constraint_bits = [0]*n\n                for j in range(n):\n                    constraint_bits[j] = m_str[n-1-j]\n\n            Then, we can process from j = n-1 down to 0 (i.e., from the highest bit to the lowest) and the constraint bit for the j-th bit is constraint_bits[j].\n\n            But note: the constraint_bits[j] is the j-th bit of m (in the function f's bit representation). \n\n            However, there's an alternative: we can process the string from left to right (the given string) and the j-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the (n-1-j)-th bit (in the function f's bit representation). \n\n            Since we are going from the highest to the lowest, we can simply use:\n\n                Let `bits` = list(map(int, m_str))   # this is the binary representation of m (from MSB to LSB)\n\n            Then, the highest bit (the one with weight 2^(n-1)) is bits[0], then bits[1] is 2^(n-2), and so on until bits[n-1] is 2^0.\n\n            Then, the coefficient for the highest bit is a_arr[n-1] (since the highest bit is the (n-1)-th bit) and the constraint bit for the highest bit is bits[0].\n\n            Similarly, the next bit (weight 2^(n-2)) is bits[1] and its coefficient is a_arr[n-2].\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                Let `a_arr` = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}]\n                Let `m_bits` = [int(c) for c in m_str]   # length n, from MSB to LSB.\n\n            Then, for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                bit_position = n-1-i   # the bit position (exponent) for the current bit is (n-1-i) because we are starting with the highest (which is exponent n-1) and then decreasing.\n\n                Then, the coefficient is a_arr[n-1-i] and the constraint bit is m_bits[i].\n\n            But wait, we are iterating from the highest bit (which is the first character) to the lowest (last character). Then, the exponent decreases from n-1 to 0.\n\n            Alternatively, we can reverse the array a_arr and then use the same index i for both.\n\n            However, note: the array a_arr is given for exponents 0 to n-1. The highest exponent is n-1, so we need the last element of a_arr for the highest bit.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                Let `a_rev` = a_arr[::-1]   # now a_rev[0] is the coefficient for the highest bit (exponent n-1) and a_rev[n-1] for the lowest (exponent 0).\n                Let `m_bits` = [int(c) for c in m_str]   # still the same.\n\n            Then, for i in range(n):\n                current_coeff = a_rev[i]\n                current_constraint = m_bits[i]\n\n            Now, we have to decide: for the current bit (which is the (n-1-i)-th bit in the original array a_arr) we can set it or not, but if we are in a tight state, we cannot set it if current_constraint is 0.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to set a bit only if the number doesn't exceed m. So:\n\n                If we are not tight, we can set the bit arbitrarily (if the coefficient is positive, we set it).\n\n                But wait, even if we are not tight, we might have set a higher bit to 0 and then set a lower bit arbitrarily? Actually, the constraint is that the entire number is <= m.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                We are going to process from the highest bit to the lowest.\n\n                Let `tight` = True initially.\n\n                We'll keep a variable `ans` for the maximum sum.\n\n                But note: we are building the number bit by bit.\n\n            Standard digit DP for this:\n\n                dp[i][tight] = maximum sum we can get from the i-th bit (from the current to the last) given that the prefix is tight.\n\n            However, the state is just two states (tight or not) and we go from i=0 to i=n (n up to 10^5). We can do:\n\n                We don't need to store the entire state for each i, because we can use a greedy decision: \n\n                Idea:\n\n                    We want to set a bit if the coefficient is positive and we are allowed to set it (without violating the constraint). But if we set a bit, we get the coefficient, and then we can set the remaining bits arbitrarily (if we are still tight, then we have to follow the constraint for the remaining bits; if we are not tight, then we can set any bits arbitrarily).\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                Let `base` = the maximum sum we can get without the constraint (which is the sum of all positive a_i). Then, we subtract the necessary bits that we cannot set because of the constraint.\n\n            But that might be complex.\n\n            Standard approach for \"maximum subset sum under a bitmask constraint\" is to use digit DP (or greedy with carry-over).\n\n            However, note: the constraint is linear (the number must be <= m). We can use:\n\n                Let `res` = 0\n                Let `tight` = True\n\n                For i in range(n):   # i from 0 to n-1, processing the i-th bit (which is the (n-1-i)-th bit in the original a_arr) and the constraint bit is m_bits[i] (which is the i-th character of the string)\n\n                    current_coeff = a_rev[i]   # which is the coefficient for the current bit (which is the (n-1-i)-th bit)\n                    current_bit_m = m_bits[i]   # the constraint bit for the current bit\n\n                    If tight:\n                        if current_bit_m == 1:\n                            # We have two choices: set the bit or not?\n                            # But if we set the bit, then the number becomes larger in this bit, but we are tight so far. Then we have to continue tight for the next bits.\n                            # However, if we don't set the bit, then we are no longer tight? Actually, if we set the bit and the constraint bit is 1, then we are still tight (because we set the same as m). But if we don't set the bit and the constraint bit is 1, then we are below m, so we are not tight anymore.\n\n                            # But note: we want to maximize the sum. So we should set the bit if the coefficient is positive, unless by setting it we break the constraint? But wait, we are tight and the constraint bit is 1, so setting the bit is allowed and we remain tight.\n\n                            # However, what if we don't set the bit and then we are not tight, then we can set all the following bits arbitrarily (if they are positive). \n\n                            # So we have two options:\n\n                            # Option 1: set the bit -> then we add current_coeff and remain tight.\n                            # Option 2: don't set the bit -> then we don't add current_coeff, but we become not tight.\n\n                            # We choose the option that gives the maximum.\n\n                            # But note: after not being tight, we can set all the remaining bits arbitrarily (if they are positive). So the total sum from Option 2 would be: current_sum + (sum of all remaining positive coefficients) [if we are not tight, we can set all positive bits].\n\n                            # However, we don't know the future coefficients. But we can precompute the suffix sum of positive coefficients.\n\n                            # Let `suffix[i]` = sum of positive values in a_rev[i:] (i.e., from the current bit to the end)\n\n                            # Then, for tight state and current_bit_m==1:\n\n                                Option1: set the bit -> then we get current_coeff plus the maximum from the rest (but the rest must be processed under tight condition for the next bits? Actually, no: we are tight only for the next bits if we set the same as m. But if we set the same, then the next bits must be <= the constraint bits.\n\n                            This becomes complicated.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                Let `total` = sum(a_arr)   # the maximum without constraint\n\n                Then, we subtract the bits that we cannot set because of the constraint.\n\n                But note: we might be forced to not set a bit that is positive because of the constraint, but then we can set all the lower bits arbitrarily.\n\n                However, the constraint is: the entire number must be <= m.\n\n                We can use a greedy algorithm that goes from the highest bit to the lowest:\n\n                    Let `ans` = 0\n                    Let `tight` = True\n                    Let `free` = 0   # the additional positive coefficients we can set in the remaining bits if we break the tight condition.\n\n                    Precompute: `suffix[i]` = the sum of max(0, a_rev[j]) for j from i to n-1.\n\n                    Then, for i in range(n):\n                        if tight:\n                            if m_bits[i] == 1:\n                                # We can choose to set this bit or not.\n\n                                # If we set this bit, then we add a_rev[i] and then we have to consider the next bits with tight condition (if the next constraint bits are 0, we cannot set them arbitrarily).\n                                # If we don't set this bit, then we break the tight condition and we can set all the remaining bits arbitrarily (only the positive ones).\n\n                                # But note: we are allowed to set the current bit to 0 even if the constraint bit is 1, and then we break the tight condition.\n\n                                # So we compare:\n\n                                    Option1: set the bit -> then we get a_rev[i] and then the maximum from the rest (with tight condition) is ... but we don't know.\n\n                                However, we can use the suffix array for the non-tight part.\n\n                                Let `option1` = a_rev[i] + (maximum from the rest with tight condition)   [but we don't know the rest with tight condition]\n\n                                Option2: not set the bit -> then we break the tight condition and we get (the sum of all positive coefficients from the rest) -> which is suffix[i+1] (if we consider only positive) but wait, the array a_rev might have negative? no, the input says ai>=0.\n\n                                Actually, since all ai>=0, then the maximum from the rest with tight condition might be less than the maximum without constraint (which is the sum of all positive in the rest).\n\n                                But note: without the constraint, the maximum is the sum of all positive. However, the tight condition might force us to not set some positive bits.\n\n                                However, if we break the tight condition, we can set all the remaining bits arbitrarily (because the constraint is only about the prefix, and we are already below m). So the maximum from the rest (after breaking) is the sum of all positive coefficients in the rest.\n\n                                So for Option2: we get suffix[i+1] (if we define suffix[i] as the sum of positive coefficients from i to the end).\n\n                                But for Option1, we have to compute the maximum from the rest under tight condition. This is recursive.\n\n            This suggests that we need a DP that considers the tight condition.\n\n            Let `dp_tight` = the maximum sum we can get from the current bit to the end if we are still tight (the prefix is equal to m's prefix so far)\n            Let `dp_not_tight` = the maximum sum we can get from the current bit to the end if we are not tight (the prefix is strictly less than m's prefix)\n\n            Then, for the current bit (i) with coefficient `a` and constraint bit `b` (0 or 1):\n\n            For the state `dp_tight`:\n\n                We have two choices: set the bit or not.\n\n                If we set the bit:\n                    Then the next state's tight condition depends on the constraint bit and the bit we set.\n\n                    - If the constraint bit is 1, then we set the bit to 1 (same as m) so the next state is still tight.\n                    - If the constraint bit is 0, then we cannot set the bit (because then the number would exceed m) -> so this branch is invalid.\n\n                If we don't set the bit:\n                    Then, if the constraint bit is 1, then we are now below m, so the next state is not tight.\n                    If the constraint bit is 0, then we are still matching (because we set 0 and m has 0) so the next state is still tight.\n\n            However, note: the constraint bit is given by `m_bits[i]`. \n\n            Therefore:\n\n                dp_tight[i] = max(\n                    (if constraint_bit[i] == 1 then (a[i] + dp_tight[i+1]) else -infinity),\n                    (if we don't set the bit: then if constraint_bit[i]==1 then (0 + dp_not_tight[i+1]) else (0 + dp_tight[i+1]))\n                )\n\n            But wait, the above is not correct: the state transition must consider the constraint bit.\n\n            Actually, for `dp_tight`:\n\n                We are tight, and the constraint bit is `b = m_bits[i]`.\n\n                We have two choices:\n\n                    Choice 1: set the bit to 1. Then the number's bit is 1. This is allowed only if b==1. Then the next state is tight (because we matched the constraint bit) and we add a[i].\n                    Choice 2: set the bit to 0. Then the next state: if b==1, then we are now below m (so not tight) and we add 0. If b==0, then we are still tight (because we matched) and we add 0.\n\n                So:\n\n                    if b == 1:\n                        set_bit = a[i] + dp_tight[i+1]\n                        not_set = 0 + dp_not_tight[i+1]\n                    else: # b==0\n                        set_bit = -10**18   # invalid, because setting the bit to 1 would make the number larger than m (since m has 0 here)\n                        not_set = 0 + dp_tight[i+1]\n\n                    Then, dp_tight[i] = max(set_bit, not_set)   [if b==1, then both are available; if b==0, then only not_set]\n\n            For `dp_not_tight`:\n\n                We are not tight, so we can set the bit arbitrarily (to 0 or 1) and we don't have to worry about the constraint.\n\n                Since all a[i] are nonnegative,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the function \\( f(x) \\) depends on which bits are set in \\( x \\). The challenge is to select the bits (from 0 to \\( n-1 \\)) such that their corresponding elements in array \\( a \\) sum up to the maximum possible value, while ensuring the resulting number \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves processing each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). For each bit, we decide whether setting it to 1 would still keep the number within bounds (i.e., not exceeding \\( m \\)). If setting a bit to 1 is allowed, we compare the benefit of setting it (adding the corresponding array element) versus not setting it (allowing more flexibility in lower bits).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming with two states:\n   - **Tight State**: The current prefix of \\( x \\) matches the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\).\n   - **Non-Tight State**: The current prefix of \\( x \\) is already less than the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\), allowing arbitrary selection of remaining bits.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit once, making it linear in time \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits. This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_arr = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    a_rev = a_arr[::-1]\n    m_bits = [int(bit) for bit in m_str] if m_str else []\n    \n    if len(m_bits) != n:\n        m_bits = [0] * (n - len(m_bits)) + m_bits\n    \n    dp_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_not_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        dp_tight[i] = -10**18\n        dp_not_tight[i] = 0\n        \n        b = m_bits[i]\n        coeff = a_rev[i]\n        \n        if b == 1:\n            set_bit_option = coeff + dp_tight[i + 1]\n            not_set_option = dp_not_tight[i + 1]\n            dp_tight[i] = max(set_bit_option, not_set_option)\n        else:\n            set_bit_option = -10**18\n            not_set_option = dp_tight[i + 1]\n            dp_tight[i] = not_set_option\n            \n        suffix_sum = sum(a_rev[i:])\n        dp_not_tight[i] = suffix_sum\n        \n    result = dp_tight[0]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of bits \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\) of coefficients, and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Reversing Arrays**: The array \\( a \\) is reversed so that the highest bit corresponds to the first element. The binary string is converted into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_not_tight`, are initialized to store the maximum sum achievable from each bit position under tight and non-tight conditions, respectively.\n4. **Processing Bits**: Starting from the least significant bit (due to the reversal), each bit is processed:\n   - **Tight State**: If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1, we can either set the bit (adding its coefficient) or leave it unset (switching to a non-tight state). If the bit in \\( m \\) is 0, we must leave it unset to stay within bounds.\n   - **Non-Tight State**: Once in a non-tight state, all subsequent bits can be set arbitrarily (since the number is already less than \\( m \\)), so the sum is simply the sum of all positive coefficients from the current bit onward.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived from the initial tight state (no bits processed yet) and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all possible bit configurations while maximizing the sum of coefficients.",
