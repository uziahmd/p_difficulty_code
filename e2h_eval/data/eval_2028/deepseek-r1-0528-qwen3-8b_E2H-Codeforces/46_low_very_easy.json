The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The subsegment must be strictly increasing after the change (if we change one number, then the entire segment must be strictly increasing).\n\n Approach:\n We can break the problem into two cases:\n 1. Without changing any number, the longest strictly increasing subsegment.\n 2. With changing exactly one number.\n\n However, note that sometimes a segment that is almost increasing might have more than one issue but we are only allowed one change.\n\n We can precompute:\n   - left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change)\n   - right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change)\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily.\n\n Consider: We can have a segment [L, R] that has at most one \"break\" (i.e., one index i such that a[i] >= a[i+1]). Then we can fix that break by changing either a[i] or a[i+1] (or even an element elsewhere? Actually, we can fix one element anywhere in the segment). However, note that the change must be to any integer, so we can set it to anything that fits the increasing condition.\n\n Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n Let's say we are going to consider a segment that is broken at one point. We can try to merge two increasing parts if we fix the drop.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute two arrays:\n      left[i] = length of the increasing subsegment ending at i (without change)\n      right[i] = length of the increasing subsegment starting at i (without change)\n\n 2. Then, we can consider segments that have exactly one violation (or none) and use the change to fix one violation.\n\n However, note: the change can be applied to any element in the segment. So we can also consider that the segment might be broken at multiple points, but we can fix one element to fix all breaks? Actually, the problem requires that the entire subsegment is strictly increasing. We are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. So we can fix one element to bridge two decreasing parts.\n\n Example: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6] \n   Without change: [2,3] is increasing, then [3,1] is decreasing, then [1,5,6] is increasing.\n\n We can change the 1 to something between 3 and 5. Then the entire segment [2,3,4,5,6] (if we change 1 to 4) is strictly increasing.\n\n How to find the maximum?\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: The entire array might be increasing except for one drop. Then we can fix that drop and extend the segment.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let dp[i] be the length of the increasing segment ending at i, considering that we might have fixed an element (but note we can fix only one, so we need to account for one break).\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate and check each index as the candidate for the change. But n up to 10^5, so we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\n Another approach:\n\n  Step 1: Find all the indices where the sequence breaks (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]). We know that without changes, we can have contiguous increasing segments separated by these breaks.\n\n  Step 2: Consider that we are allowed to fix one element. Then we can potentially merge two increasing segments if the drop is fixed.\n\n  Conditions for merging two increasing segments [l...i] and [i+1...r] (where the drop is at i and i+1):\n\n    We can fix either the element at i or the element at i+1.\n\n    Case 1: Fix a[i]. Then we require that the segment from l to i-1 is increasing and the entire segment from l to r must be strictly increasing. When we fix a[i], we set it to a value that is greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. Therefore, we require a[i-1] < a[i+1] (if we have at least two elements on the left and one on the right). Then the total length would be (length of left part) + (length of right part) + 1 (the fixed element) but wait: the fixed element is at position i, so actually we are replacing a[i] and then the segment from l to r becomes contiguous.\n\n    Actually, the segment we are considering is from l to r, which originally has two increasing parts: [l, i] (which is increasing until i) and [i+1, r] (which is increasing). But note: we are allowed to change one element. We can change a[i] to something that fits between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if we want",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of an array where, after changing at most one element, the subsegment becomes strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking segments that can be made strictly increasing with a single modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - `left[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n\n2. **Check for Single Violation**:\n   - For each element in the array, check if the current element is part of a segment that can be fixed by modifying one element. Specifically, look for positions where `a[i] >= a[i+1]` (a violation) and determine if merging adjacent increasing segments is possible by fixing either `a[i]` or `a[i+1]`.\n\n3. **Merge Segments**:\n   - If a violation is found at index `i`, check if the elements before and after `i` can form a strictly increasing sequence when `a[i]` or `a[i+1]` is modified. The maximum possible segment length is then calculated by combining the left and right increasing segments around the violation point.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the entire array is already strictly increasing.\n   - Ensure the solution works for arrays with all identical elements or very short lengths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = max(max(left), max(right))\n    if best >= n:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n            total_length = 1\n            if i - left[i] + 1 <= 0 or i + 1 + right[i+1] >= n:\n                continue\n                \n            if left[i] == 1 and right[i+1] == 1:\n                continue\n                \n            if left[i] > 1 and right[i+1] > 1:\n                if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    total_length = left[i] + right[i+1] + 1\n                else:\n                    total_length = max(left[i], right[i+1]) + 1\n            else:\n                if left[i] == 1:\n                    total_length = right[i+1] + 1\n                else:\n                    total_length = left[i] + 1\n                    \n            if total_length > best:\n                best = total_length\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the array size `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: Directly returns the result if the array length is 1 or if the entire array is already strictly increasing.\n3. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - `left[i]` is computed by traversing from left to right, counting consecutive increasing elements ending at each index.\n   - `right[i]` is computed by traversing from right to left, counting consecutive increasing elements starting at each index.\n4. **Check Violations**: For each index `i`, if `a[i] >= a[i+1]`, it checks if modifying `a[i]` or `a[i+1]` can merge adjacent increasing segments into a longer strictly increasing segment.\n5. **Update Best Length**: The maximum segment length found during the violation check is updated and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one modification, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
