Wait leaf: multiset count under that leaf equals number of strings equal to that leaf, up to c_s, but since only that leaf, capacity equals c_s but cannot exceed 1? Actually you can choose c_s up to k, but number of strings in multiset equal to that leaf cannot exceed c_s, but you could include up to 1 string (since strings are of length n and each element is a string; are duplicates allowed? Multiset allows duplicates, so you can include multiple copies of same string. So count per leaf is up to c_s with no other bound. So leaf capacity equals c_s up to k. So leaf res[t]=1 for t in 0..k.

But counting maximum possible size of beautiful multiset equals sum of counts at level 1 children? Wait multiset elements are strings length n. For prefixes of length 1..n constraints exist. The tree root (empty) doesn't have c. Maximum total multiset size is sum over two children at depth1, but constrained by c at those nodes. So we need merge nodes up to depth1, not include empty root. So process merging leaves into nodes of depth n-1 down to depth1. So final arrays at depth1 for each of two nodes; total maximum size is sum of their capacities.
